                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for items specified on the CCL, you may not export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) an item subject to the EAR without a license if, at the time of export, reexport or transfer (in-country) you know that the item:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Will be used in the design, development, production or use of rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles capable of a range of at least 300 kilometers in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Will be used, anywhere in the world except by governmental programs for nuclear weapons delivery of NPT Nuclear Weapons States that are also member of NATO, in the design, development, production or use of rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles, regardless of range capabilities, for the delivery of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Will be used in the design, development, production or use of any rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4, but you are unable to determine:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The characteristics (i.e., range capabilities) of the rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles, regardless of range capabilities, will be used in a manner prohibited under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (a) of this section: For the purposes of this section, ``Rocket Systems'' include, but are not limited to, ballistic missile systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets. Also, for the purposes of this section, ``unmanned air vehicles'' include, but are not limited to, cruise missile systems, target drones and reconnaissance drones.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional prohibition on persons informed by BIS. BIS may inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a specific export, reexport or transfer (in-country) or for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of use in, or diversion to, the activities specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse persons from compliance

with the license requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> License review standards. (1) Applications to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) the items subject to this section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) would make a material contribution to the proliferation of certain rocket systems, or unmanned air vehicles. When an export, reexport or transfer (in-country) is deemed to make a material contribution, the license will be denied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) the items subject to this section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) would make a material contribution to the proliferation of certain rocket systems, or unmanned air vehicles.
