                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each cargo tank must be equipped to relieve pressure and vacuum  conditions in conformance with this section and the applicable  individual specification. The pressure and vacuum relief system must be  designed to operate and have sufficient capacity to prevent cargo tank  rupture or collapse due to over-pressurization or vacuum resulting from  loading, unloading, or from heating and cooling of lading. Pressure  relief systems are not required to conform to the ASME Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Type and construction of relief systems and devices. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each  cargo tank must be provided with a primary pressure relief system  consisting of one or more reclosing pressure relief valves. A secondary  pressure relief system consisting of another pressure relief valve in  parallel with the primary pressure relief system may be used to augment  the total venting capacity of the cargo tank. Non-reclosing pressure  relief devices are not authorized in any cargo tank except when in  series with a reclosing pressure relief device. Gravity actuated  reclosing valves are not authorized on any cargo tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When provided by Sec. 173.33(c)(1)(iii) of this subchapter,  cargo tanks may be equipped with a normal vent. Such vents must be set  to open at not less than 1 psig and must be designed to prevent loss of  lading through the device in case of vehicle overturn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section. Set  pressure is a function of MAWP as set forth in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each pressure relief device must be able to withstand dynamic  pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and  sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a  total volume of liquid released   not exceeding one gallon before the relief device recloses to a leak- tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle  orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. An  acceptable method is outlined in TTMA RP No. 81-97 ``Performance of  Spring Loaded Pressure Relief Valves on MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, DOT 406,  DOT 407, and DOT 412 Tanks'' (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 171.7  of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After August 31, 1995, each pressure relief device must be able  to withstand a dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design  set pressure and sustained above the design set pressure for at least 60  milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding 1 L  before the relief valve recloses to a leak-tight condition. This  requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This  capability must be demonstrated by testing. TTMA RP No. 81, cited in  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, is an acceptable test procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each reclosing pressure relief valve must be constructed and  installed in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized adjustment of the  relief valve setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No shut-off valve or other device that could prevent venting  through the pressure relief system may be installed in a pressure relief  system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The pressure relief system must be mounted, shielded and  drainable so as to minimize the accumulation of material that could  impair the operation or discharge capability of the system by freezing,  corrosion or blockage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Location of relief devices. Each pressure relief device must  communicate with the vapor space above the lading as near as practicable  to the center of the vapor space. For example, on a cargo tank designed  to operate in a level attitude, the device should be positioned at the  horizontal and transverse center of the cargo tank; on cargo tanks  sloped to the rear, the device should be located in the forward half of  the cargo tank. The discharge from any device must be unrestricted.  Protective devices which deflect the flow of vapor are permissible  provided the required vent capacity is maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Settings of pressure relief system. The set pressure of the  pressure relief system is the pressure at which it starts to open,  allowing discharge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary pressure relief system. The set pressure of each primary  relief valve must be no less than 120 percent of the MAWP, and no more  than 132 percent of the MAWP. The valve must reclose at not less than  108 percent of the MAWP and remain closed at lower pressures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secondary pressure relief system. The set pressure of each  pressure relief valve used as a secondary relief device must be not less  than 120 percent of the MAWP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Venting capacity of pressure relief systems. The pressure relief  system (primary and secondary, including piping) must have sufficient  venting capacity to limit the cargo tank internal pressure to not more  than the cargo tank test pressure. The total venting capacity, rated at  not more than the cargo tank test pressure, must be at least that  specified in table I, except as provided in Sec. 178.348-4.</p><p class="depth2">Table I--Minimum Emergency Vent Capacity</p><p class="depth2">[In cubic feet free air/hour at 60 F and 1 atm.] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Cubic feet</p><p class="depth2">Exposed area in square feet                    free air</p><p class="depth2">per hour ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 20.........................................................       15,800 30.........................................................       23,700 40.........................................................       31,600 50.........................................................       39,500 60.........................................................       47,400 70.........................................................       55,300 80.........................................................       63,300 90.........................................................       71,200 100........................................................       79,100 120........................................................       94,900 140........................................................      110,700 160........................................................      126,500 180........................................................      142,300 200........................................................      158,100 225........................................................      191,300 250........................................................      203,100 275........................................................      214,300 300........................................................      225,100 350........................................................      245,700 400........................................................      265,000 450........................................................      283,200 500........................................................      300,600 550........................................................      317,300 600........................................................      333,300 650........................................................      348,800 700........................................................      363,700 750........................................................      378,200 800........................................................      392,200 850........................................................      405,900 900........................................................      419,300</p><p class="depth2">950........................................................      432,300 1,000......................................................      445,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Interpolate for intermediate sizes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary pressure relief system. Unless otherwise specified in  the applicable individual specification, the primary relief system must  have a minimum venting capacity of 12,000 SCFH per 350 square feet of  exposed cargo tank area, but in any case at least one fourth the  required total venting capacity for the cargo tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secondary pressure relief system. If the primary pressure relief  system does not provide the required total venting capacity, additional  capacity must be provided by a secondary pressure relief system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certification of pressure relief devices. The manufacturer of  any pressure relief device, including valves, frangible (rupture) disks,  vacuum vents and combination devices must certify that the device model  was designed and tested in accordance with this section and the  appropriate cargo tank specification. The certificate must contain  sufficient information to describe the device and its performance. The  certificate must be signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer  who approved the flow capacity certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rated flow capacity certification test. Each pressure relief  device model must be successfully flow capacity certification tested  prior to first use. Devices having one design, size and set pressure are  considered to be one model. The testing requirements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 3 devices of each specific model must be tested for  flow capacity at a pressure not greater than the test pressure of the  cargo tank. For a device model to be certified, the capacities of the  devices tested must fall within a range of plus or minus 5 percent of  the average for the devices tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rated flow capacity of a device model may not be greater  than 90 percent of the average value for the devices tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rated flow capacity derived for each device model must be  certified by a responsible official of the device manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Marking of pressure relief devices. Each pressure relief device  must be permanently marked with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturer's name;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Model number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Set pressure, in psig; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rated flow capacity, in SCFH at the rating pressure, in psig.
