                            <p class="depth0">There may be special situations in which the facts demonstrate that  the hours for which contract overtime compensation is paid to employees  working on a ``task'' or ``stint'' basis actually qualify as overtime  hours under section 7(e)(5), (6), or (7). Where this is true, payment of  one and one-half times an agreed hourly rate for ``task'' or ``stint''  work may be equivalent to payment pursuant to agreement of one and one- half time a piece rate. The alternative methods of overtime pay  computation permitted by section 7(g)(1) or (2), as explained in  Sec. Sec. 778.415 through 778.421 may be applicable in such a case.</p><p class="depth0">Effect of Failure To Count or Pay for Certain Working Hours</p>
