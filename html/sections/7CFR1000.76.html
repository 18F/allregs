                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">On or before the 25th day after the end of the month (except as provided in Sec. 1000.90), the operator of a partially regulated distributing plant, other than a plant that is subject to marketwide pooling of producer returns under a State government's milk classification and pricing program, shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or, if the handler submits the information specified in Sec. Sec. --------.30(b) and --------.31(b) of the order, the handler may elect to pay the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. A partially regulated distributing plant that is subject to marketwide pooling of producer returns under a State government's milk classification and pricing program shall pay the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The payment under this paragraph shall be an amount resulting from the following computations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From the plant's route disposition in the marketing area:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subtract receipts of fluid milk products classified as Class I milk from pool plants, plants fully regulated under other Federal orders, and handlers described in Sec. 1000.9(c) and Sec. 1135.11 of this chapter, except those receipts subtracted under a similar provision of another Federal milk order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Subtract receipts of fluid milk products from another nonpool plant that is not a plant fully regulated under another Federal order to the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed of to the nonpool plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any payment obligation under any order; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subtract the pounds of reconstituted milk made from nonfluid milk products which are disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For orders with multiple component pricing, compute a Class I differential price by subtracting Class III price from the current month's Class I price. Multiply the pounds remaining after the computation in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by the amount by which the Class I differential price exceeds the producer price differential, both prices to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant except that neither the adjusted Class I differential price nor the adjusted producer price differential shall be less than zero;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For orders with skim milk and butterfat pricing, multiply the remaining pounds by the amount by which the Class I price exceeds the uniform price, both prices to be applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant except that neither the adjusted Class I price nor the adjusted uniform price differential shall be less than the lowest announced class price; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless the payment option described in paragraph (d) is selected, add the amount obtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted milk included in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by any positive difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the partially regulated distributing plant (less $1.00 if the reconstituted milk is labeled as such) and the Class IV price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The payment under this paragraph shall be the amount resulting from the following computations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine the value that would have been computed pursuant to Sec. --------.60 of the order for the partially regulated distributing plant if

the plant had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received at the plant from a pool plant, a plant fully regulated under another Federal order, and handlers described in Sec. 1000.9(c) and Sec. 1135.11 of this chapter shall be allocated at the partially regulated distributing plant to the same class in which such products were classified at the fully regulated plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred from the partially regulated distributing plant to a pool plant or a plant fully regulated under another Federal order shall be classified at the partially regulated distributing plant in the class to which allocated at the fully regulated plant. Such transfers shall be allocated to the extent possible to those receipts at the partially regulated distributing plant from the pool plant and plants fully regulated under other Federal orders that are classified in the corresponding class pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are in Class I and for which a value is computed pursuant to Sec. --------.60 of the order for the partially regulated distributing plant shall be priced at the statistical uniform price or uniform price, whichever is applicable, of the respective order regulating the handling of milk at the receiving plant, with such statistical uniform price or uniform price adjusted to the location of the nonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest announced class price of the respective order); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant so requests, the handler's value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. --------.60 of the order shall include a value of milk determined for each nonpool plant that is not a plant fully regulated under another Federal order which serves as a supply plant for the partially regulated distributing plant by making shipments to the partially regulated distributing plant during the month equivalent to the requirements of Sec. --------. 7(c) of the order subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The operator of the partially regulated distributing plant submits with its reports filed pursuant to Sec. Sec. --------.30(b) and --------.31(b) of the order similar reports for each such nonpool supply plant;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The operator of the nonpool plant maintains books and records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at the plant which are made available if requested by the market administrator for verification purposes; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The value of milk determined pursuant to Sec. --------.60 for the unregulated supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed for computing the obligation of the partially regulated distributing plant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the partially regulated distributing plant's value of milk computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subtract:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The gross payments that were made for milk that would have been producer milk had the plant been fully regulated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, the gross payments by the operator of the nonpool supply plant for milk received at the plant during the month that would have been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The payments by the operator of the partially regulated distributing plant to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under which the plant is also a partially regulated distributing plant and, if paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section applies, payments made by the operator of the nonpool supply plant to the producer-settlement fund of any order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The operator of a partially regulated distributing plant that is subject to marketwide pooling of returns under a milk classification and pricing program that is imposed under the authority of a State government shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month (except as provided in Sec. 1000.90) to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund an amount computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2">After completing the computations described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, determine the value of the remaining pounds of fluid milk

products disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area by multiplying the hundredweight of such pounds by the amount, if greater than zero, that remains after subtracting the State program's class prices applicable to such products at the plant's location from the Federal order Class I price applicable at the location of the plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any handler may elect partially regulated distributing plant status for any plant with respect to receipts of nonfluid milk ingredients that are reconstituted for fluid use. Payments may be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the positive difference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at the location of the plant where the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed and the Class IV price. This payment option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or more Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be determined by the market administrator.</p>
