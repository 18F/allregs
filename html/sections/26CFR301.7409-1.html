                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Letter to organization. When the Assistant Commissioner  (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) concludes that a section  501(c)(3) organization has engaged in flagrant political intervention  and is likely to continue to engage in political intervention that  involves political expenditures, the Assistant Commissioner (Employee  Plans and Exempt Organizations) shall send a letter to the organization  providing it with the facts based on which the Service believes that the  organization has been engaging in flagrant political intervention and is  likely to continue to engage in political intervention that involves  political expenditures. The organization will have 10 calendar days  after the letter is sent to respond by establishing that it will  immediately cease engaging in political intervention, or by providing  the Service with sufficient information to refute the Service's evidence  that it has been engaged in flagrant political intervention. The  Internal Revenue Service will not proceed to seek an injunction under  section 7409 until after the close of this 10-day response period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination by Commissioner. If the organization does not  respond within 10 calendar days to the letter under paragraph (a) of  this section in a manner sufficient to dissuade the Assistant  Commissioner (Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations) of the need for  an injunction, the file will be forwarded to the Commissioner of  Internal Revenue. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue will personally  determine whether to forward to the Department of Justice a  recommendation that it immediately bring an action to enjoin the  organization from making further political expenditures. The  Commissioner may also recommend that the court action include any other  action that is appropriate in ensuring that the assets of the section  501(c)(3) organization are preserved for section 501(c)(3) purposes. The  authority of the Commissioner to make the determinations described in  this paragraph may not be delegated to any other persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> and   the regulations thereunder if the participation or intervention is  flagrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date.
