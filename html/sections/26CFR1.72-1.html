                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General principle. Section 72 prescribes rules relating to the inclusion in gross income of amounts received under a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract unless such amounts are specifically excluded from gross income under other provisions of Chapter 1 of the Code. In general, these rules provide that amounts subject to the provisions of section 72 are includible in the gross income of the recipient except to the extent that they are considered to represent a reduction or return of premiums or other consideration paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts to be considered as a return of premiums. For the purpose of determining the extent to which amounts received represent a reduction or return of premiums or other consideration paid, the provisions of section 72 distinguish between ``amounts received as an annuity'' and ``amounts not received as an annuity''. In general, ``amounts received as an annuity'' are amounts which are payable at regular intervals over a period of more than one full year from the date on which they are deemed to begin, provided the total of the amounts so payable or the period for which they are to be paid can be determined as of that date. See paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of Sec. 1.72-2. Any other amounts to which the provisions of section 72 apply are considered to be ``amounts not received as an annuity''. See Sec. 1.72-11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> ``Amounts received as an annuity.'' (1) In the case of ``amounts received as an annuity'' (other than certain employees' annuities described in section 72(d) and in Sec. 1.72-13), a proportionate part of each amount so received is considered to represent a return of premiums or other consideration paid. The proportionate part of each annuity payment which is thus excludable from gross income is determined by the ratio which the investment in the contract as of the date on which the annuity is deemed to begin bears to the expected return under the contract as of that date. See Sec. 1.72-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of employees' annuities of the type described in section 72(d), no amount received as an annuity in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies is includible in the gross income of a recipient until the aggregate of all amounts received thereunder and excluded from gross income under the applicable income tax law exceeds the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee under Sec. 1.72-8. Thereafter, all amounts so received are includible in the gross income of the recipient. See Sec. 1.72-13.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> ``Amounts not received as an annuity''. In the case of ``amounts not received as an annuity'', if such amounts are received after an annuity has begun and during its continuance, amounts so received are generally includible in the

gross income of the recipient. Amounts not received as an annuity which are received at any other time are generally includible in the gross income of the recipient only to the extent that such amounts, when added to all amounts previously received under the contract which were excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the income tax law applicable at the time of receipt, exceed the premiums or other consideration paid (see Sec. 1.72-11). However, if the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract includes amounts for which a deduction was allowed under section 404 as contributions on behalf of an owner-employee, the amounts received under the circumstances of the preceding sentence shall be includible in gross income until the amount so included equals the amount for which the deduction was so allowed. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-17.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Classification of recipients. For the purpose of the regulations under section 72, a recipient shall be considered an ``annuitant'' if he receives amounts under an annuity contract during the period that the annuity payments are to continue, whether for a term certain or during the continuing life or lives of the person or persons whose lives measure the duration of such annuity. However, a recipient shall be considered a ``beneficiary'' rather than an ``annuitant'' if the amounts he receives under a contract are received after the term of the annuity for a life or lives has expired and such amounts are paid by reason of the fact that the contract guarantees that payments of some minimum amount or for some minimum period shall be made. For special rules with respect to beneficiaries, see paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (c) of Sec. 1.72-11.
