                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Specific. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the investigatory  material compiled for law enforcement purposes in the following systems  of records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G),  (H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and from the provisions of this  part:  Farm Credit Bank loans--FCA. Production Credit Association loans--FCA. Agricultural Credit Association loans--FCA. Federal Land Credit Association loans--FCA. Agricultural Credit Bank loans--FCA. Office of Inspector General Investigative Files--FCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In addition, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2),  investigatory materials compiled for criminal law enforcement in the  system of records described in (b)(2) are exempt from all subsections of  5 U.S.C. 552a, except (b), (c) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e)  (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i). Exemptions from the particular  subsections are justified for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record  subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her  would reveal investigative interest on the part of the OIG. This would  enable record subjects to impede the investigation by, for example,  destroying evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, or fleeing the  area to avoid inquiries or apprehension by law enforcement personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the  access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j)(2) of the  Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> From subsection (d) because the records contained in this  system relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to  those records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal  confidential informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the  personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain  investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing  criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible  administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations to be  continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law  enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or  introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly  relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of  effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information  that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it  would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to  assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and completeness of all  information obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement  investigation the requirement that information be collected to the  greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a  serious impediment to law   enforcement in that the subject of the investigation would be informed  of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to  avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations or duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements  of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede  the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> From subsections (e)(4) (G), and (H), and (I), (e)(8), (f),  (g) and (h) because this system is exempt from the access provisions of  subsection (d) pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Office of Inspector General Investigative Files--FCA.
