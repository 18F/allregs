The incorporation by reference of these standards has been approved by the Director of the Federal Register. Incorporated standards have the same force and effect as this Standard (24 CFR part 3280), except that whenever reference standards and this Standard are inconsistent, the requirements of this Standard prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. The Department will enforce the listed editions of material incorporated by this section. Where two or more incorporated standards are equivalent in application, the manufacturer may use either standard. If a later edition is to be enforced, the Department will publish a notice of change in the Federal Register. These incorporated standards are available for purchase from the organization that developed the standard at the corresponding addresses noted below. Incorporated standards are available for inspection at the Office of Manufactured Housing Program, Manufactured Housing and Construction Standards Division, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Room B-133, Washington, DC 20410. Copies of incorporated standards that are not available from their producer organizations may be obtained from the Office of Manufactured Housing Programs. These standards are also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
