                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form of application or notice. An application, notice, or  informational filing required by Sec. 574.3 of this part shall be filed  on the Application/Information Filing H-(e) -------- form. (As specified  in the form's instructions, the blank line following the H-(e) should be  filled in by applicants with the appropriate ``1'', ``1-S'', ``2'',  ``3'', or ``4'' depending on the type of application.) The specific  application requirements for each type of filing are indicated on the  form. An acquiror may request confidential treatment of portions of an   application or notice only by complying with the requirements of  paragraph (f) of this section. In the case of an application involving a  merger (including a merger with an interim association) the Application/ Information Filing H-(e) -------- form shall be used in lieu of an  application that otherwise would be required for such merger under  Sec. Sec. 546.2, 552.13, and 563.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> H-(e)1. This application type shall be filed under Sec.  574.3(a) of this part by a company, other than a savings and loan  holding company, for approval to acquire direct or indirect control of  one savings association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (a)(3) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> H-(e)2. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This application type shall be filed under Sec.  574.3(a) of this part:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> By a savings and loan holding company for approval to acquire  and hold separately one or more savings associations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> By any other company for approval to acquire and hold separately  more than one savings association;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> By a savings and loan holding company for approval of an  acquisition of shares issued by a savings association in a qualified  stock issuance pursuant to Sec. 574.8 of this part; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> By any director, officer, or any individual who owns, controls,  or holds with power to vote (or holds proxies representing) more than 25  percent of the voting shares of a savings and loan holding company for  approval of an acquisition of one or more savings associations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The OTS may determine as a general matter or on a case-by-case  basis not to require application information not relevant to  transactions described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (C) and (D) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> H-(e)3. This application shall be used for all applications  filed under Sec. 574.3(a) of this part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By a savings and loan holding company for approval of  acquisitions by a merger, consolidation, or purchase of assets of a  savings association or uninsured institution or a savings and loan  holding company; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By any company for approval of acquisitions by a merger,  consolidation, or purchase of assets of two or more savings  associations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> H-(e)4. This information filing shall be used to claim that a  reorganization is exempt from prior written approval of the OTS under  Sec. 574.3(c)(1)(ii) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notice Form 1393, parts A and B. This form shall be used for all  notices filed under Sec. 574.3(b) of this part regarding the  acquisition of control of a savings association by any person or persons  not constituting a company except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications, notices, and rebuttals.  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Complete copies including exhibits and all other pertinent documents  of applications, notices, and rebuttal submissions shall be filed with  the Region in which the savings association or associations involved in  the transaction have their home office or offices. Unsigned copies shall  be conformed. Each copy shall include a summary of the proposed  transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any person or company may amend an application, notice or  rebuttal submission, or file additional information, upon request of the  OTS or, in the case of the party filing an application, notice, or  rebuttal, upon such party's own initiative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> H-(e)4 Information filing. Any information filing required to be  made to claim that a reorganization is exempt from prior written  approval of the OTS under Sec. 574.3(c)(1)(ii) of this part shall be  clearly labeled ``H-(e)4 Information Filing''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sufficiency and waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Sec.  574.6(c)(5), an application or notice filed pursuant to Sec. 574.3 (a)  or (b) shall not be deemed sufficient unless it includes all of the  information required by the form prescribed by the Office and this part,  including a complete description of the acquiror's proposed plan for  acquisition of control   whether pursuant to one or more transactions, and any additional  relevant information as the Office may require by written request to the  applicant. Unless an application or notice specifically indicates  otherwise, the application or notice shall be considered to pertain to  acquisition of 100 percent of a savings association's voting stock.  Where an application or notice pertains to a lesser amount of stock, the  Office may condition its approval or non-disapproval to apply only to  such amount, in which case additional acquisitions may be made only by  amendment to the acquiror's application or notice and the Office's  approval or non-disapproval thereof. Failure by an applicant to respond  completely to a written request by the Office for additional information  within 30 calendar days of the date of such request may be deemed to  constitute withdrawal of the application, notice, or rebuttal filing or  may be treated as grounds for denial of an application, issuance of a  notice of disapproval of a notice, or rejection of a rebuttal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The period for the Office's review of any proposed acquisition  will commence upon receipt by the Office of a notice or application  deemed sufficient under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Office  shall notify an acquiror in writing within 30 calendar days after proper  filing of an application or notice as to whether an application or  notice--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is sufficient;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is insufficient, and what additional information is requested  in order to render the application or notice sufficient; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is materially deficient and will not be processed. The Office  shall also notify an acquiror in writing within 15 calendar days after  proper filing of any additional information furnished in response to a  specific request by the Office as to whether the application or notice  is thereby deemed to be sufficient. If the Office fails to so notify an  acquiror within such time, the application or notice shall be deemed to  be sufficient as of the expiration of the applicable period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After additional information has been requested and supplied,  the Office may request additional information only with respect to  matters derived from or prompted by information already furnished, or  information of a material nature that was not reasonably available from  the acquiror, was concealed, or pertains to developments subsequent to  the time of the Office's initial request for additional information.  With regard to information of a material nature that was not reasonably  available from the acquiror or was concealed at the time an application  or notice was deemed to be sufficient or which pertains to developments  subsequent to the time an application or notice was deemed to be  sufficient, the Office, at its option, may request such additional  information as it considers necessary, or may deem the application or  notice not to be sufficient until such additional information is  furnished and cause the review period to commence again in its entirety  upon receipt of such additional information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The 60-day period for the Office's review of an application or  notice deemed to be sufficient also may be extended by the Office for up  to an additional 30 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The period for the Office's review of a notice may be further  extended not to exceed two additional times for not more than 45 days  each time if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The Office determines that any acquiring party has not furnished  all the information required under this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the Office's judgment, any material information submitted is  substantially inaccurate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Office has been unable to complete an investigation of each  acquiror because of any delay caused by, or the inadequate cooperation  of, such acquiror; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The Office determines that additional time is needed to  investigate and determine that no acquiring party has a record of  failing to comply with the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53  of title 31 of the United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to an H-(e)4 information filing, the Chief Counsel  or his or her designee shall have 30 days after receipt of a filing  deemed sufficient to   disapprove the assertion that the company qualifies for the exemption  provided in Sec. 574.3(c)(1)(ii). After the expiration of such 30-day  period without response from the Chief Counsel, the filing shall be  deemed to be approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Office may waive any requirements of this paragraph (c)  determined to be unnecessary by the Office, upon its own initiative,  upon the written request of an acquiring person, or in a supervisory  case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The acquiror must publish a public notice of  an application under Sec. 574.3(a) or Sec. 574.8 of this chapter or a  notice under Sec. 574.3(b) of this chapter, in accordance with the  procedures in subpart B of part 516 of this chapter. Promptly after  publication, the acquiror must transmit copies of the public notice and  the publisher's affidavit to OTS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The acquiror must provide a copy of the public notice to the  savings association whose stock is sought to be acquired, and may  provide a copy of the public notice to any other person who may have an  interest in the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OTS will notify the appropriate state supervisor and will notify  persons whose requests for announcements, as described in 12 CFR part  563e, appendix B, have been received in time for the notification. OTS  may also notify any other persons who may have an interest in the  application or notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submission of comments. Commenters may submit comments on the  application or notice in accordance with the procedures in subpart C of  part 516 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disclosure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any application, notice, other filings, public  comment, or portion thereof, made pursuant to this part for which  confidential treatment is not requested in accordance with this  paragraph (f), shall be immediately available to the public and not  subject to the procedures set forth herein. Public disclosure shall be  made of other portions of an application, notice, other filing or public  comment in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the  provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and parts  503 and 505 of this chapter. Applicants and other submitters should  provide confidential and non-confidential versions of their filings, as  described in Sec. 574.6(f) (2) and (3) in order to facilitate this  process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person who submits any information or causes or permits any  information to be submitted to the Office pursuant to this part may  request that the Office afford confidential treatment under the Freedom  of Information Act to such information for reasons of personal privacy  or business confidentiality, which shall include such information that  would be deemed to result in the commencement of a tender offer under  Sec. 240.14d-2 of title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or for  any other reason permitted by Federal law. Such request for  confidentiality must be made and justified in accordance with paragraph  (f)(5) of this section at the time of filing, and must, to the extent  practicable, identify with specificity the information for which  confidential treatment may be available and not merely indicate portions  of documents or entire documents in which such information is contained.  Failure to specifically identify information for which confidential  treatment is requested, failure to specifically justify the bases upon  which confidentiality is claimed in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of  this section, or overbroad and indiscriminate claims for confidential  treatment, may be bases for denial of the request. In addition, the  filing party should take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure, as  nearly as practicable, that at the time the information is first  received by the Office (i) it is supplied segregated from information  for which confidential treatment is not being requested, (ii) it is  appropriately marked as confidential, and (iii) it is accompanied by a  written request for confidential treatment which identifies with  specificity the information as to which confidential treatment is  requested. Any such request must be substantiated in accordance with  paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All documents which contain information for which a request for  confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions  thereof shall be marked by the person submitting the records with a  prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable   form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page, stating  ``Confidential Treatment Requested by [name].'' If such marking is  impracticable under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked  ``Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]'' should be securely  attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential  treatment is requested. Each of the records transmitted in this manner  should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so  that they are separately identifiable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A determination as to the validity of any request for  confidential treatment may be made when a request for disclosure of the  information under the Freedom of Information Act is received, or at any  time prior thereto. If the Office receives a request for the information  under the Freedom of Information Act, OTS will advise the filing party  before it discloses material for which confidential treatment has been  requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall  consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or  necessary for the determination of the request for confidential  treatment, the following information regarding the request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reasons, concisely stated and referring to specific  exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the  information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of  Information Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory  provisions which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The existence and applicability of any prior determination by  the Office, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning confidential  treatment of the information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The adverse consequences to a business enterprise, financial or  otherwise, that would result from disclosure of confidential commercial  or financial information, including any adverse effect on the business'  competitive position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The measures taken by the business to protect the  confidentiality of the commercial or financial information in question  and of similar information, prior to, and after, its submission to the  Office;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling  the commercial or financial information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Whether commercial or financial information was voluntarily  submitted to the Office, and, if so, whether and how disclosure of the  information would tend to impede the availability of similar information  to the Office;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation  of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded  confidential treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The amount of time after the consummation of the proposed  acquisition for which the information should remain confidential and a  justification thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as  the requesting person may consider appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any person requesting access to an application, notice, other  filing, or public comment made pursuant to this part for purposes of  commenting on a pending submission may prominently label such request:  ``Request for Disclosure of Filing(s) Made Under part 574/Priority  Treatment Requested.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Supervisory cases. The provisions of paragraphs (d), (e) and (f)  of this section may be waived by the Office in connection with a  transaction approved by the Office for supervisory reasons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> or, if a copy of the notice is  forwarded to the state supervisory agency, the Office may request that  the views and recommendations of such state supervisory agency be  submitted immediately in any form or by any means acceptable to the  Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Additional procedures for acquisitions involving mergers.  Acquisitions of control involving mergers (including mergers with an  interim association) shall also be subject to the procedures set forth  in Sec. 563.22 of this chapter to the extent applicable, except as  provided in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Additional procedures for acquisitions of recently converted  savings associations. Applications, notices and rebuttals involving  acquisitions of the stock of a recently converted savings association  under Sec. 563b.3(i)(3) of this chapter shall also address the criteria  for approval set forth at Sec. 563b.3(i)(5) of this chapter.
