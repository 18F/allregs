                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the Department appeals and the case involves removal,  separation, or suspension continuing beyond the date of the appeal, and  when the EEOC   Administrative Judge's decision orders retroactive restoration, the  Department shall comply with the decision to the extent of the temporary  or conditional restoration of the employee to duty status in the  position specified in the decision, pending the outcome of the  Department appeal. The employee may decline the offer of interim relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service under the temporary or conditional restoration  provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall be credited toward the  completion of a probationary or trial period, eligibility for a within- grade increase, or the completion of the service requirement for career  tenure, if the EEOC upholds the decision on appeal. Such service shall  not be credited toward the completion of any applicable probationary or  trial period or the completion of the service requirement for career  tenure, if the EEOC reverses the decision on appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the Department appeals, the Department may delay the  payment of any amount, other than prospective pay and benefits, ordered  to be paid to the Complainant until after the appeal is resolved. If the  Department delays payment of any amount pending the outcome of the  appeal and the resolution of the appeal requires the Department to make  the payment, then the Department shall pay interest from the date of the  original decision until payment is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department shall notify the EEOC and the employee in writing  at the same time the Department appeals that the relief the Department  provides is temporary or conditional and, if applicable, that the  Department will delay the payment of any amounts owed but will pay  interest as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Failure of the  Department to provide notification will result in the dismissal of the  Department's appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Department may, by notice to the Complainant, decline to  return the Complainant to the Complainant's place of employment if the  Department determines that the return or presence of the Complainant  will be unduly disruptive to the work environment. However, prospective  pay and benefits must be provided. The determination not to return the  Complainant to the Complainant's place of employment is not reviewable.  A grant of interim relief does not insulate a Complainant from  subsequent disciplinary or adverse action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the Department files an appeal and has not provided required  interim relief, the Complainant may request dismissal of the  Department's appeal. Any such request must be filed with the Office of  Federal Operations within 25 days of the date of service of the  Department's appeal. A copy of the request must be served on the  Department at the same time the request is filed with EEOC. The  Department may respond with evidence and argument to the Complainant's  request to dismiss within 15 days of the date of service of the request.</p><p class="depth2">Statistics and Reporting Requirements</p>
