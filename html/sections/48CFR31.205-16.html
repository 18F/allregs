                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gains and losses from the sale, retirement, or other disposition  (but see 31.205-19) of depreciable property shall be included in the  year in which they occur as credits or charges to the cost grouping(s)  in which the depreciation or amortization applicable to those assets was  included (but see paragraph (f) of this subsection). However, no gain or  loss shall be recognized as a result of the transfer of assets in a  business combination (see 31.205-52).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gain or loss is the difference between the net amount  realized and the undepreciated balance of the asset on the date the  contractor becomes a lessee; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the application of (b)(1) of this subsection results in a  loss--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The allowable portion of the loss is zero if the fair market  value exceeds the undepreciated balance of the asset on the date the  contractor becomes a lessee; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The allowable portion of the loss is limited to the difference  between the fair market value and the undepreciated balance of the asset  on the date the contractor becomes a lessee if the fair market value is  less than the undepreciated balance of the asset on the date the  contractor becomes a lessee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gains and losses on disposition of tangible capital assets,  including those acquired under capital leases (see 31.205-11(h), shall  be considered as adjustments of depreciation costs previously  recognized. The gain or loss for each asset disposed of is the  difference between the net amount realized, including insurance proceeds  from involuntary conversions, and its undepreciated balance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The gain recognized for contract costing purposes shall be  limited to the difference between the acquisition cost (or for assets  acquired under a capital lease, the value at which the leased asset is  capitalized) of the asset and its undepreciated balance (except see  paragraphs (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this subsection).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special considerations apply to an involuntary conversion which  occurs when a contractor's property is destroyed by events over which  the owner has no control, such as fire, windstorm, flood, accident,  theft, etc., and an insurance award is recovered. The following govern  involuntary conversions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When there is a cash award and the converted asset is not  replaced, gain or loss shall be recognized in the period of disposition.  The gain recognized for contract costing purposes shall be limited to  the difference between the acquisition cost of the asset and its  undepreciated balance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the converted asset is replaced, the contractor shall  either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adjust the depreciable basis of the new asset by the amount of  the total realized gain or loss; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recognize the gain or loss in the period of disposition, in  which case the Government shall participate to the same extent as  outlined in paragraph (e)(1) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Gains and losses on the disposition of depreciable property  shall not be recognized as a separate charge or credit when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gains and losses are processed through the depreciation reserve  account and reflected in the depreciation allowable under 31.205-11; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The property is exchanged as part of the purchase price of a  similar item, and the gain or loss is taken into consideration in the  depreciation cost basis of the new item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Gains and losses arising from mass or extraordinary sales,  retirements, or other disposition other than through business  combinations shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Gains and losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange  of capital assets other than depreciable property shall be excluded in  computing contract costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> With respect to long-lived tangible and identifiable intangible  assets held for use, no loss shall be allowed for a write-down from  carrying value to fair value as a result of impairments caused by events  or changes in circumstances (e.g., environmental damage, idle facilities  arising from a declining business base, etc.). If depreciable property  or other capital assets have been written down from carrying value to  fair value due to impairments, gains or losses upon disposition shall be  the amounts that would have been allowed had the assets not been written  down.
