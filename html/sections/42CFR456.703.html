                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section, in order for FFP to be paid or made available under section  1903 of the Act for covered outpatient drugs, the State must have in  operation, by not later than January 1, 1993, a DUR program consisting  of prospective drug review, retrospective drug use review, and an  educational program that meets the requirements of this subpart. The  goal of the State's DUR program must be to ensure appropriate drug  therapy, while permitting sufficient professional prerogatives to allow  for individualized drug therapy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception for drugs dispensed to certain nursing facility  residents. Prospective drug review and retrospective drug use review  (including interventions and education) under the DUR program are not  required for drugs dispensed to residents of nursing facilities that are  in compliance with the drug regimen review procedures set forth in part  483 of this chapter. This does not preclude the State agency from making  such drugs subject to prospective DUR or retrospective DUR or both,  provided the State agency makes the drugs subject to all the  requirements of this subpart applicable to the respective review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exemption for certain covered outpatient drugs dispensed by  hospitals and health maintenance organizations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State plan must  provide that covered outpatient drugs dispensed by a hospital using drug  formulary systems and billed to the plan at no more than the hospital's  purchasing costs are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.  Individual hospitals requesting this exemption must provide assurances  to the State agency that they meet the requirements specified in section  1927(j)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State plan must provide that covered outpatient drugs  dispensed by health maintenance organizations are not subject to the  requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of predetermined standards. A DUR program must assess drug  use information against predetermined standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Source of predetermined standards. The predetermined standards  must be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Developed directly by the State or its contractor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtained by the State through contracts with commercial vendors  of DUR services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtained by the State from independent organizations, such as  the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, or entities receiving  funding from the Public Health Service, CMS, or State agencies; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any combination of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for predetermined standards. The predetermined  standards used in the DUR program must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The source materials for their development are consistent with  peer-reviewed medical literature (that is, scientific, medical, and  pharmaceutical publications in which original manuscripts are published  only after having been critically reviewed by unbiased independent  experts) and the following compendia:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> American Medical Association Drug Evaluations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Differences between source materials were resolved by physicians  and pharmacists developing consensus solutions. The consensus process  means the reliance, by the criteria developers, on   the expertise of physicians and pharmacists to evaluate differences in  criteria source materials and to come to agreement on how differences  should be resolved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> They are non-proprietary and readily available to providers of  services. Systems and algorithms using the predetermined standards may  remain proprietary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> They are clinically-based and scientifically valid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The review based on clinical criteria uses predetermined  standards to determine the population at risk of a clinically  significant adverse medical result and applies standards, appropriate to  this population, across providers and patients to determine the provider  outliers whose prescribing, dispensing, or consumption practices may not  conform to accepted standards of care. Various statistical measures  (including mean, range, or other measures at the discretion of the  State) may be applied to these data. Standards may be considered in  deciding if an in-depth review is needed to determine whether to  intervene once the potential therapeutic problems have been identified  through the use of clinical criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> They have been tested against claims data prior to adoption in  order to validate the level of possibly significant therapeutic problems  without undue levels of false positives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The predetermined standards for prospective and retrospective  DUR are compatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> They are subjected to ongoing evaluation and modification either  as a result of actions by their developer or as a result of  recommendations by the DUR Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Access to predetermined standards. Upon their adoption,  predetermined standards must be available to the public. Pharmacists and  physicians must be informed of the existence of predetermined standards  and of how they can obtain copies of them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Confidentiality of patient related data. In implementing the DUR  program, the agency must establish, in regulations or through other  means, policies concerning confidentiality of patient related data that  are consistent with applicable Federal confidentiality requirements at  part 431, subpart F of this chapter; the State Pharmacy Practice Act;  and the guidelines adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy or other  relevant licensing bodies.
