The  Warden shall also give notice that the sender may appeal the rejection.  The Warden shall also notify an inmate of the rejection of any letter  addressed to that inmate, along with the reasons for the rejection and  shall notify the inmate of the right to appeal the rejection. The Warden  shall refer an appeal to an official other than the one who originally  disapproved the correspondence. The Warden shall return rejected  correspondence to the sender unless the correspondence includes plans  for or discussion of commission of a crime or evidence of a crime, in  which case there is no need to return the correspondence or give notice  of the rejection, and the correspondence should be referred to  appropriate law enforcement authorities. Also, contraband need not be  returned to the sender.</p>
