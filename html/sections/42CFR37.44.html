                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applications for facility approval. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilities seeking  approval must demonstrate the ability to make high quality digital chest  radiographs by submitting to NIOSH digital radiographic image files of a  test object (e.g., a plastic step-wedge or chest phantom which will be  provided on loan from NIOSH) as well as digital radiographic image files  from six or more sample chest radiographs that are of acceptable quality  to one or more individuals selected by NIOSH from the panel of B Readers  and a qualified medical physicist or consultant, both designated by  NIOSH. Image files must be submitted on standard portable media (compact  or digital video disc) and formatted to meet specifications of the  Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard PS 3.12- 2011 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10). Applicants will be  advised of any reasons for denial of approval. All submitted images must  be made within 60 days prior to the date of application using the same  technique, equipment, and software as will be used by the facility under  the requested approval. At least six chest radiographs and one test  object radiograph must have been made with each digital radiographic  unit to be used by the facility under the requested approval. The  corresponding radiographic image files must be submitted on standard  portable media (compact or digital video disc) and formatted to meet  specifications of the current DICOM Standard PS 3.12-2011. Documentation  must include the following: the identity of the facility where each  radiograph was made; the X-ray machine used; and the model, version, and  production date of each image acquisition software program and hardware  component. The submitted sample digital chest image files must include  at least two taken with the detector in the vertical position and two in  the horizontal position where the imaging system permits these  positions, and at least two chest images must be from persons within the  highest quartile of chest diameters (28 cm or greater).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each radiographic facility submitting chest radiographic image  files for approval under this section must complete and include an X-ray  Facility Certification Document (Form CDC/NIOSH (M)2.11) describing each  X-ray system component, and the models and versions of image acquisition  hardware and software to be used to make digital chest radiographs under  the Act. The form must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of a dated report signed by a qualified medical  physicist, documenting the evaluation of radiation safety and  performance characteristics specified in this section for each digital  radiography system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the report of the most recent radiation safety  inspection by a licensing agency, if such agency exists;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A listing of all deficiencies noted in either of the reports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that all the listed deficiencies have been  corrected; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The names and relevant training and experience of facility  personnel described in paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section. To  be acceptable, the report by the medical physicist and radiation safety  inspection specified in this paragraph must have been made within 1 year  prior to the date of submission of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facilities must maintain ongoing licensure and certification  under relevant local, State, and Federal laws and regulations for all  digital equipment and related processes covered under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NIOSH or its representatives may make a physical inspection of  the applicant's facility and any approved radiographic facility at any  reasonable time to determine if the requirements of this subpart are  being met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NIOSH may periodically require a facility to resubmit  radiographic image files of the NIOSH-supplied test   object (e.g., step-wedge or chest phantom), sample radiographs, or a  Facility Certification Document. Approvals granted to facilities under  this section may be suspended or withdrawn by notice in writing when, in  the opinion of NIOSH, deficiencies in the quality of radiographs or  information submitted under this section warrant such action. A copy of  a notice suspending or withdrawing approval will be sent to each  operator that has listed the facility for its use under this Part and  must be displayed on the mine bulletin board adjacent to the operator's  approved plan. The operator's approved plan may be reevaluated by NIOSH  in response to such suspension or withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A qualified medical physicist who is familiar with the facility  hardware and software systems for image acquisition, manipulation,  display, and storage, must be on site or available as a consultant. The  physicist must be trained in evaluating the performance of radiographic  equipment and facility quality assurance programs, and must be licensed/ approved by a State or Territory of the United States or certified by a  competent U.S. national board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Facilities must document that testing performed by a qualified  medical physicist has verified that performance of each image  acquisition system for which approval is sought met initial  specifications and standards of the equipment manufacturer and  performance testing as required under paragraphs (b), (e), and (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A formal written quality assurance program must be established  at each facility addressing radiation exposures, equipment maintenance,  and image quality, and must conform to the standards in AAPM Report No.  74, pages 1-19, 47-53, and 56, and AAPM Report No. 116, sections VIII,  IX, and X (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications for facility approval must include a comprehensive  assessment by a qualified medical physicist within 12 months prior to  application addressing the performance of X-ray generators, automatic  exposure controls, and image capture systems. The assessment must comply  with the following guidelines: AAPM Report No. 93, pages 1-68; AAPM  Report No. 74, pages 6-11; and AAPM Report No. 14, pages 1-96  (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Radiographic technique charts must be used that are developed  specifically for the X-ray system and detector combinations used,  indicating exposure parameters by anatomic measurements. If automated  exposure control devices are used, calibration for chest imaging must be  documented using the actual voltages and image capture systems.  Radiological exposures resulting from at least ten (randomly selected)  digital chest images obtained at the facility must be monitored at least  quarterly to detect and correct potential dose creep, using methods  specified in AAPM Report No. 31 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.   37.10). Radiation exposures must be compared to a professionally  accepted reference level published in the American College of Radiology  (ACR) Practice Guideline for Diagnostic Reference Levels in Medical X- Ray Imaging, pages 1-6 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10). In  addition, the medical physicist must submit an annual assessment of  measured or estimated radiation exposures, with specific recommended  actions to minimize exposures during examinations performed under this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each digital radiography device and system, performance must  be monitored annually in accordance with the recommendations of AAPM  Report No. 93 (incorporated by reference, see Sec.  37.10), except for  the testing specifically excluded below. Documentation must be  maintained on the completion of quality assurance testing, including the  reproducibility of X-ray output, linearity and reproducibility of mA  settings, accuracy and reproducibility of timer and kVp settings,  accuracy of source-to-detector distance, and X-ray field focal spot  size, selection, beam quality, congruence and collimation. For DR  systems, the following tests listed in AAPM Report No. 93 are not  required under this part:  (i) Section 8.4.5: Laser beam function (ii) Section 8.4.9: Erasure Thoroughness (iii) Section 8.4.11: Imaging Plate (IP) Throughput</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Facilities must maintain documentation, available for inspection  by   NIOSH for 5 years, of the ongoing implementation of policies and  procedures for monitoring and evaluating the effective management,  safety, and proper performance of chest image acquisition, digitization,  processing, compression, transmission, display, archiving, and retrieval  functions of digital radiography devices and systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In conducting medical examinations pursuant to this Part,  physicians and radiographic facilities must maintain the results and  analysis of these examinations (including any hard copies or digital  files containing individual data, interpretations, and images)  consistent with applicable statutes and regulations governing the  treatment of individually identifiable health information, including, as  applicable, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules (45 CFR Part 160 and  Subparts A, C, and E of Part 164).
