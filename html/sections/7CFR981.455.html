                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transfers of almonds. Interhandler transfers of almonds pursuant to Sec. 981.55 shall be reported to the Board on ABC Form 7. The report shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date of transfer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The names, and plant locations of both the transferring and receiving handlers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The variety of almonds transferred;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the almonds are shelled or unshelled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The name of the handler assuming reserve and assessment obligations on the almonds transferred;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the almonds had been treated to achieve a 4-log reduction in Salmonella bacteria, pursuant to Sec. 981.442(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A unique handler identification number for each lot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfers of reserve credits. A handler may transfer reserve credits to another handler after having filed with the Board, in accordance with Sec. 981.474, a completed ABC Form 13/14 covering the almonds to be diverted to a noncompetitive outlet and all the documentation applicable thereto. Such a transfer does not relieve the transferring handler of any reserve obligations for the applicable crop year. The transferred credit shall not exceed the quantity needed by the receiving handler to cover that handler's reserve obligation. The Board shall complete the transfer upon receipt of an ABC Form 11 executed by both handlers. No transfer of reserve credits shall be made to satisfy a handler's inedible disposition obligation incurred pursuant to Sec. 981.42(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfers of reserve withholding obligation. A handler may transfer reserve withholding obligation to other handlers pursuant to Sec. 981.55 after having filed with the Board an ABC Form 11 executed by both handlers. The Board shall approve the transfer upon receipt of the properly completed form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of inedible obligation may be made, with the approval of the Board, only when the inedible kernels are physically transferred with the entire lot of almonds. The transfer of the lot shall be reported on ABC Form 9, showing date of transfer and, for the transferring handler, the (1) original inspection certificate number, (2) total weight shown on the certificate, and (3) weight of inedible kernels shown on the certificate. For the receiving handler, ABC Form 9 shall show the (1) new inspection certificate number, (2) total weight shown on the certificate, and (3)

weight of inedible kernels shown on the certificate. ABC Form 9 shall be signed by both, the transferring handler and the receiving handler, and submitted by the receiving handler to the Board for approval.
