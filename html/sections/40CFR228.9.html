                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The monitoring program, if deemed necessary by the Regional  Administrator or the District Engineer, as appropriate, may include  baseline or trend assessment surveys by EPA, NOAA, other Federal  agencies, or contractors, special studies by permittees, and the  analysis and interpretation of data from remote or automatic sampling  and/or sensing devices. The primary purpose of the monitoring program is  to evaluate the impact of disposal on the marine environment by  referencing the monitoring results to a set of baseline conditions. When  disposal sites are being used on a continuing basis, such programs may  consist of the following components:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trend assessment surveys conducted at intervals frequent enough  to assess the extent and trends of environmental impact. Until survey  data or other information are adequate to show that changes in frequency  or scope are necessary or desirable, trend assessment and baseline  surveys should generally conform to the applicable requirements of Sec.  228.13. These sur veys shall be the responsibility of the Federal  government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special studies conducted by the permittee to identify immediate  and short-term impacts of disposal operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These surveys may be supplemented, where feasible and useful, by  data collected from the use of automatic sampling buoys, satellites or  in situ platforms, and from experimental programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EPA will require the full participation of permittees, and  encourage the full participation of other Federal and State and local  agencies in the development and implementation of disposal site  monitoring programs. The monitoring and research programs presently  supported by permittees may be incorporated into the overall monitoring  program insofar as feasible.</p>
