The paired  frequencies listed in this section are used for two-way communications  between a master station and remote stations. Ancillary one-way  communications on paired frequencies are permitted on a case-by-case  basis. Ancillary communications between interrelated master stations are  permitted on a secondary basis. The normal channel bandwidth assigned  will be 12.5 kHz. EA licensees, however, may combine contiguous channels  without limit or justification. Site-based licensees may combine  contiguous channels up to 50 kHz, and more than 50 kHz only upon a  showing of adequate justification. Any bandwidth (12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or  greater) authorized in accordance with this section may be subdivided  into narrower bandwidths to create additional (or sub) frequencies  without the need to specify each discrete frequency within the specific  bandwidth. Equipment that is used to create additional frequencies by  narrowing bandwidth (whether authorized for a 12.5 kHz, 25 kHz or  greater bandwidth) will be required to meet, at a minimum, the 0.00015 percent tolerance requirement so that all  subfrequencies will be within the emission mask. Systems licensed for  frequencies in these MAS bands prior to August 1, 1975, may continue to  operate as authorized until June 11, 1996, at which time they must  comply with current MAS operations based on the 12.5 kHz channelization  set forth in this paragraph. Systems licensed between August 1, 1975,  and January 1, 1981, inclusive, are required to comply with the  grandfathered 25 kHz standard bandwidth and channelization requirements  set forth in this paragraph. Systems originally licensed after January  1, 1981, and on or before May 11, 1988, with bandwidths of 25 kHz and  above, will be grandfathered indefinitely.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)

The Commission has  allocated the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for use by the Direct Broadcast  Satellite Service (DBS), the Multichannel Video Distribution and Data  Service (MVDDS), and the Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit Fixed  Satellite Service (NGSO FSS). MVDDS shall be licensed on a non-harmful  interference co-primary basis to existing DBS operations and on a co- primary basis with NGSO FSS stations in this band. MVDDS use can be on a  common carrier and/or non-common carrier basis and can use channels of  any desired bandwidth up to the maximum of 500 MHz provided the EIRP  does not exceed 14 dBm per 24 megahertz. Private operational fixed  point-to-point microwave stations authorized after September 9, 1983,  are licensed on a non-harmful interference basis to DBS and are required  to make any and all adjustments necessary to prevent harmful  interference to operating domestic DBS receivers. Incumbent public  safety licensees shall be afforded protection from MVDDS and NGSO FSS  licensees, however all other private operational fixed licensees shall  be secondary to DBS, MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees. As of May 23, 2002,  the Commission no longer accepts applications for new licenses for  point-to-point private operational fixed stations in this band, however,  incumbent licensees and previously filed applicants may file  applications for minor modifications and amendments (as defined in Sec.  1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer of control, or  assignment of license. Notwithstanding any other provisions, no private  operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations are permitted to  cause harmful interference to broadcasting-satellite stations of other  countries operating in accordance with the Region 2 plan for the  Broadcasting-Satellite Service established at the 1983 WARC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 12,700 to 13,150 MHz. 50 MHz authorized
