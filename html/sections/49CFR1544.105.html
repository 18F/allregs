                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial approval of security program. Unless otherwise  authorized by TSA, each aircraft operator required to have a security  program under this part must submit its proposed security program to the  designated official for approval at least 90 days before the intended  date of operations. The proposed security program must meet the  requirements applicable to its operation as described in Sec.  1544.101.  Such requests will be processed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated official, within 30 days after receiving the  proposed aircraft operator security program, will either approve the  program or give the aircraft operator written notice to modify the  program to comply with the applicable requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The aircraft operator may either submit a modified security  program to the designated official for approval, or petition the  Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 days of  receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be  filed with the designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for  reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the  petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator  for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within  30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to  withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to  modify.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendment requested by an aircraft operator. An aircraft  operator may submit a request to TSA to amend its security program as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request for an amendment must be filed with the designated  official at least 45 days before the date it proposes for the amendment  to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the  designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 30 days after receiving a proposed amendment, the  designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request  to amend.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amendment to an aircraft operator security program may be  approved if the designated official determines that safety and the  public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the  level of security required under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the aircraft operator  may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A petition for  reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated  official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition,  together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for  reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30  days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve  the amendment, or affirming the denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any aircraft operator may submit a group proposal for an  amendment   that is on behalf of it and other aircraft operators that co-sign the  proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amendment by TSA. If safety and the public interest require an  amendment, TSA may amend a security program as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated official notifies the aircraft operator, in  writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30  days within which the aircraft operator may submit written information,  views, and arguments on the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After considering all relevant material, the designated official  notifies the aircraft operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the  notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than  30 days after the aircraft operator receives the notice of amendment,  unless the aircraft operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider  no later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The  aircraft operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the  designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the  effective date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated  official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the  petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator  for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within  30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to  withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that  there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety  in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this  section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may  issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in  paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the  aircraft operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the designated  official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons  and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The aircraft operator may  file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section;  however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency  amendment.
