Upon violation of the Act, or any regulation issued under the Act, by the grantee, or any officer, agent, operator or employee thereof, the person responsible for or permitting the violation shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000. Each day during which a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Liquidated damages, where applicable, will be imposed in addition to the fine (19 U.S.C. 81s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review. All fines assessed by the port director under this section will be reviewed by the Assistant Commissioner, Office of International Trade, or his designee, Headquarters, to determine whether further action against the grantee or operator, such as suspension or a recommendation for revocation of the grant, is warranted.
