                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A savings association must, to the extent practicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Keep the area where the savings association conducts transactions involving insurance products or annuities physically segregated from areas where retail deposits are routinely accepted from the general public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the areas where insurance product or annuity sales activities occur; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Clearly delineate and distinguish those areas from the areas where the savings association's retail deposit-taking activities occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referrals. Any person who accepts deposits from the public in an area where such transactions are routinely conducted in a savings association may refer a consumer who seeks to purchase an insurance product or annuity to a qualified person who sells that product only if the person making the referral receives no more than a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not depend on whether the referral results in a transaction.</p>
