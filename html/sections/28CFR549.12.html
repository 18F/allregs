                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clinically indicated.  The Bureau tests inmates who have sentences of six months or more if  health services staff determine, taking into consideration the risk as  defined by the Centers for Disease Control guidelines, that the inmate  is at risk for HIV infection. If the inmate refuses testing, staff may  initiate an incident report for refusing to obey an order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exposure incidents. The Bureau tests an inmate, regardless of  the length of sentence or pretrial status, when there is a well-founded  reason to believe that the inmate may have transmitted the HIV  infection, whether intentionally or unintentionally, to Bureau employees  or other non-inmates who are lawfully present in a Bureau institution.  Exposure incident testing does not require the inmate's consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surveillance Testing. The Bureau conducts HIV testing for  surveillance purposes as needed. If the inmate refuses testing, staff  may initiate an incident report for refusing to obey an order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inmate request. An inmate may request to be tested. The Bureau  limits such testing to no more than one per 12-month period unless the  Bureau determines that additional testing is warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Counseling. Inmates being tested for HIV will receive pre- and  post-test counseling, regardless of the test results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tuberculosis (TB). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Bureau screens each inmate for TB  within two calendar days of initial incarceration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Bureau conducts screening for each inmate annually as  medically indicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Bureau will screen an inmate for TB when health services  staff determine that the inmate may be at risk for infection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An inmate who refuses TB screening may be subject to an incident  report for refusing to obey an order. If an inmate refuses skin testing,  and there is no contraindication to tuberculin skin testing, then,  institution medical staff will test the inmate involuntarily.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Bureau conducts TB contact investigations following any  incident in which inmates or staff may have been exposed to  tuberculosis. Inmates   will be tested according to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diagnostics. The Bureau tests an inmate for an infectious or  communicable disease when the test is necessary to verify transmission  following exposure to bloodborne pathogens or to infectious body fluid.  An inmate who refuses diagnostic testing is subject to an incident  report for refusing to obey an order.</p>
