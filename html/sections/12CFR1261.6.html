                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Each Bank shall determine, in accordance with this  section,   the number of votes that each member of the Bank may cast for each  directorship that is to be filled by the vote of the members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Number of votes. For each member directorship and each  independent directorship that is to be filled in an election, each  member shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of Bank stock  that the member was required to hold as of the record date.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the number of votes that any  member may cast for any one directorship shall not exceed the average  number of shares of Bank stock required to be held as of the record date  by all members located in the same State as of the record date. If a  Bank has issued more than one class of stock, it shall calculate the  average number of shares separately for each class of stock, using the  total number of members in a State as the denominator, and shall apply  those limits separately in determining the maximum number of votes that  any member owning that class of stock may cast in the election. If a  Bank's capital plan was not in effect as of the record date, the number  of shares of Bank stock that a member was required to hold as of the  record date shall be determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 1263.20  and 1263.22 of this chapter. If a Bank's capital plan was in effect as  of the record date, the number of shares of Bank stock that a member was  required to hold as of the record date shall be determined in accordance  with the minimum investment requirement established by the Bank's  capital plan; however, for any member whose Bank stock is less than the  minimum investment during a transition period, the amount of Bank stock  to be used shall be the number of shares of Bank stock actually owned by  the member as of the record date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Voting preferences. If the board of directors of a Bank includes  any voting preferences as part of its approved capital plan, those  preferences shall supersede the provisions of paragraph (b) of this  section that otherwise would allow a member to cast one vote for each  share of Bank stock it was required to hold as of the record date. If a  Bank establishes a voting preference for a class of stock, the members  with voting rights shall remain subject to the provisions of section  7(b) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1427(b)) that prohibit any member from  casting any vote in excess of the average number of shares of stock  required to be held by all members in its state.
