                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Under section 103(l), any private purpose bond issued after December 31, 1982 (including any obligation issued thereafter to refund private purpose bonds issued before December 31, 1982) shall be treated as an obligation not described in section 103(a) unless the information reporting requirement (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) is substantially satisfied with respect to the issue of which the bond is a part. For rules concerning bonds issued after December 31, 1986, see Sec. 1.149(e)-1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Private purpose bonds. For purposes of this section, the term ``private purpose bond'' means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any industrial development bond (as defined in section 103(b)(2) and Sec. 1.103-7(b)(1)), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any obligation which is issued as part of an issue all or a major portion of the proceeds of which are to be used directly or indirectly--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To finance loans to individuals for educational or related expenses (hereinafter referred to as a ``student loan bond''), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By an organization described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from taxation by reason of section 501(a) (hereinafter referred to as ``private exempt entity bond'').
The meaning of the terms ``major portion'' and ``directly or indirectly'' shall be the same as under Sec. 1.103-7. Student loan bonds include, but are not limited to, qualified scholarship funding bonds (as defined in section 103(e)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information required. An obligation satisfies the requirements of section 103(l) and this section only if it is issued as part of an issue with respect to which the issuer, based on information and reasonable expectations determined as of the date of issue, submits on Form 8038 the information required therein, including--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and employer identification number of the issuer,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of issue (as defined in paragraph (g)(1)),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The face amount of the issue,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The total purchase price of the issue,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amount allocated to a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The amount of lendable proceeds (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The stated interest rate of each maturity (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) or, if the interest rate is variable, a description of the method under which the interest rate is computed,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term (as defined in paragraph (g)(3)) of each maturity,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A general description of the property to be financed by the issue (including property financed by an obligation that will be refunded with the issue proceeds) which includes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The type of bond issued, that is, a student loan bond, a private exempt entity bond, or an industrial development bond and in the case of an industrial development bond described in section 103(b)(4), the subparagraph of section 103(b)(4) that describes the property, e.g., for a football stadium, that the property is described in section 103(b)(4)(B),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The recovery classes (as defined in section 168(c)(2)), if applicable, of the various items of financed property and the approximate amount of lendable proceeds attributable thereto,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The approximate amount of lendable proceeds attributable to land or other property not described in subdivision (ii),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of obligations described in section 103(b)(6) or private exempt entity bonds, the four-digit Standard Industrial Classification Code of the facilities financed,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If section 103(k) (relating to public approval requirement for industrial development bonds) applies to such issue, the name(s) of the approving governmental unit(s) and of the applicable elected representative(s) (as defined in section 103(k)(2)(E) and Sec. 5f.103-2(e)) or a description of the voter referendum that approved the issue for such unit(s), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The name, address, and employer identification number of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each initial principal user (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) of any facilities provided with the proceeds of the issue,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The common parent, if any, of any affiliated group of corporations (as defined in section 1504(a) but determined without regard to the exceptions of section 1504(b)) of which such initial principal user is a member, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any person (not included under paragraph (c)(11)(i)) that is treated as a principal user under section 103(b)(6)(L), but only if the issue is treated as a separate issue under section 103(b)(6)(K).
The information to be supplied must be determined based on information and reasonable expectations as of the date of issue. Therefore, such statement need not be amended to report information learned subsequent to the date of issue. However, if the statement is filed after the date of issue it may reflect such information and the reasonable expectations of the issuer as of that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional information. An issuer may supply the following information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average maturity of the issue (as defined in section 103(b)(14)), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The average reasonably expected economic life (as defined in section 103(b)(14)) of the facility which is financed with the issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time for filing. The statement required by section 103(l) and this section shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the 2nd calendar month after the close of the calendar quarter in which the obligation is issued. It may be filed at any time before such date but must be complete based on facts and reasonable expectations as of the date of issue. The Secretary may grant an extension of time for filing the statement required under section 103(l) and this section if there is reasonable cause for the failure to file such statement in a timely fashion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Place for filing. Form 8038 is to be mailed to the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term date of issue means the date on which the issuer physically exchanges the first of the obligations which are part of the issue for the underwriter's (or other purchaser's) funds. In the event that amounts are

periodically advanced with respect to an issue, the date of issue is when the first of such obligations under the issue is created and the funds are advanced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term maturity means those obligations of the issue having both the same maturity date and the same stated interest rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term term of an issue means the duration of the period beginning on the date of issue and ending on the latest maturity date of any obligation of the issue without regard to optional redemption dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term lendable proceeds means the amount of the original proceeds, net of amounts allocated to a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund. See generally Sec. 1.103-13(b) and Sec. 1.103-14(d) for further definitions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The term initial principal user means each person who as of the date of issue is obligated to use the facility to such an extent that under section 103(b)(6) such person would be treated as a principal user. With respect to organizations described in section 501(c)(3), however, such determination is made without regard to whether such organization is treated as an exempt organization under section 103(b)(3) and Sec. 1.103-7(b)(2).
