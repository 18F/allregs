The  term ``return to work'' as used in this subpart is not limited to  returning to work at the employee's normal worksite or usual position,  but may include returning to work at other locations and in other  positions. In general, the employer should make all reasonable efforts  to place the employee in his or her former or an equivalent position, in  accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(2), if the employee has fully recovered  after one year. The Office of Personnel Management (not OWCP)  administers this provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where the employer has specific alternative positions available  for partially disabled employees, the employer should advise the  employee in writing of the specific duties and physical requirements of  those positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the employer has no specific alternative positions  available for an employee who can perform restricted or limited duties,  the employer should advise the employee of any accommodations the agency  can make to accommodate the employee's limitations due to the injury.</p>
