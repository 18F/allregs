The progress schedule time shall be represented in the form of a bar graph with the contract time plotted along the horizontal axis. The starting date of the schedule shall be the date the contractor receives the ``Notice to Proceed.'' The ending date shall be the original contract completion date. At a minimum, both dates shall be indicated on the progress schedule. The specific item of work, i.e., ``Excavation'', ``Floor Tile'', ``Finish Carpentry'', etc., should be plotted along the vertical axis and indicated by a line or bar at which time(s) during the contract this work is scheduled to take place. The schedule shall be submitted in triplicate and signed by the contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The actual percent completion will be based on the value of installed work divided by the current contract amount. The actual completion percentage will be indicated on the monthly progress report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The progress schedule will be revised when individual or cumulative time extensions of 15 calendar days or more are granted for any reason. The revised schedule should indicate the new contract completion date and should reflect any changes to the installation time(s) of the items of work affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The revised progress schedule will be used for reporting future scheduled percentage completion.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
