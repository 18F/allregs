                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> on the distribution of money in the same distribution or any  related distribution. See Sec. 1.704-4(e)(1) for a determination of the  distributee partner's adjusted tax basis in a distribution subject to  section 704(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>  as applicable. The increase in the distributee partner's adjusted tax  basis in the partnership interest under paragraph (a) of this section is  taken into account in determining the distributee partner's adjusted tax  basis in the distributed property other than property previously  contributed by the partner. See Sec. 1.704-4(e)(2) for a determination  of basis in a distribution subject to section 704(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Previously contributed property. The distributee partner's  adjusted tax basis in distributed property that the partner previously  contributed to the partnership is determined as if it were distributed  in a separate and independent distribution prior to the distribution  that is subject to section 737 and Sec. 1.737-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partnership's adjusted tax basis in partnership property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Increase in basis. The partnership's adjusted tax basis in eligible  property is increased by the amount of gain recognized by the  distributee partner under section 737.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible property. Eligible property is property that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Entered into the calculation of the distributee partner's net  precontribution gain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has an adjusted tax basis to the partnership less than the  property's fair market value at the time of the distribution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Would have the same character of gain on a sale by the  partnership to an unrelated party as the character of any of the gain  recognized by the distributee partner under section 737; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Was not distributed to another partner in a distribution  subject to section 704(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.704-4 that was part of the  same distribution as the distribution subject to section 737.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Method of adjustment. For the purpose of allocating the basis  increase under paragraph (c)(2) of this section among the eligible  property, all eligible property of the same character is treated as a  single group. Character for this purpose is determined in the same  manner as the character of the recognized gain is determined under Sec.  1.737-1(d). The basis increase is allocated among the separate groups of  eligible property in proportion to the character of the gain recognized  under section 737. The basis increase is then allocated among property  within each group in the order in which the property was contributed to  the partnership by the partner, starting with the property contributed  first, in an amount equal to the difference between the property's fair  market value and its adjusted tax basis to the partnership at the time  of the distribution. For property that has the same character and was  contributed in the same (or a related) transaction, the basis increase  is allocated based on the respective amounts of unrealized appreciation  in such properties at the time of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 754 adjustments. The basis adjustments to partnership  property made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not  elective and must be made regardless of whether the partnership has an  election in effect under section 754. Any adjustments to the bases of  partnership property (including eligible property as defined in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section) under section 734(b) pursuant to a  section 754 election (other than basis adjustments under section  734(b)(1)(A) described in the following sentence) must be made after  (and must take into account) the adjustments to basis made under  paragraph (a) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Basis adjustments  under section 734(b)(1)(A) that are attributable to distributions of  money to the distributee partner that are part of the same distribution  as the distribution of property subject to section 737 are made before  the adjustments to basis under paragraph (a) and paragraph (c)(1) of  this section. See Sec. 1.737-1(c)(2)(ii) for the effect, if any, of  basis adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(A) on a partner's net  precontribution gain. See also Sec. 1.704-4(e)(3) for a similar rule  regarding basis adjustments pursuant to a section 754 election in the  context of section 704(c)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recovery of increase to adjusted tax basis. Any increase to the  adjusted tax basis of partnership property under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section is recovered using any applicable recovery period and  depreciation (or other cost recovery) method (including first-year  conventions) available to the partnership for newly purchased property  (of the type adjusted) placed in service at the time of the  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section. Unless otherwise specified, partnership income equals  partnership expenses (other than depreciation deductions for contributed  property) for each year of the partnership, the fair market value of  partnership property does not   change, all distributions by the partnership are subject to section 737,  and all partners are unrelated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January  1, 1995, A, B, and C form partnership ABC as equal partners. A  contributes Property A, nondepreciable real property with a fair market  value of $10,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $5,000. B contributes  Property B, nondepreciable real property with a fair market value and  adjusted tax basis of $10,000. C contributes $10,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 1998, Property B is distributed to A in  complete liquidation of A's interest in the partnership. A recognizes  $5,000 of gain under section 737, an amount equal to the excess  distribution of $5,000 ($10,000 fair market value of Property B less  $5,000 adjusted tax basis in A's partnership interest) and A's net  precontribution gain of $5,000 ($10,000 fair market value of Property A  less $5,000 adjusted tax basis of such property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A's adjusted tax basis in A's partnership interest is  increased by the $5,000 of gain recognized under section 737. This  increase is taken into account in determining A's basis in the  distributed property. Therefore, A's adjusted tax basis in distributed  Property B is $10,000 under section 732(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995,  A, B, and C form partnership ABC as equal partners. A contributes the  following nondepreciable real property located in the United States to  the partnership:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair</p><p class="depth0">market    Adjusted</p><p class="depth0">value    tax basis ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Property A1.......................................    $10,000      5,000 Property A2.......................................     10,000      2,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B contributes $10,000 cash and Property B, nondepreciable real  property located outside the United States, with a fair market value and  adjusted tax basis of $10,000. C contributes $20,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1998, Property B is distributed to A in a  current distribution and Property A1 is distributed to B in a current  distribution. A recognizes $5,000 of gain under section 704(c)(1)(B) and  Sec. 1.704-4 on the distribution of Property A1 to B, the difference  between the fair market value of such property ($10,000) and the  adjusted tax basis in distributed Property A1 ($5,000). The adjusted tax  basis of A's partnership interest is increased by this $5,000 of gain  under section 704(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.704-4(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The increase in the adjusted tax basis of A's partnership  interest is taken into account in determining the amount of the excess  distribution. As a result, there is no excess distribution because the  fair market value of Property B ($10,000) is less than the adjusted tax  basis of A's interest in the partnership at the time of distribution  ($12,000). A therefore recognizes no gain under section 737 on the  receipt of Property B. A's adjusted tax basis in Property B is $10,000  under section 732(a)(1). The adjusted tax basis of A's partnership  interest is reduced from $12,000 to $2,000 under section 733. See  Example 3 of Sec. 1.737-1(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 31, 1995, A, B, and C  form partnership ABC as equal partners. A contributes the following  nondepreciable property to the partnership:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fair</p><p class="depth0">market    Adjusted</p><p class="depth0">value    tax basis ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Property A1.......................................     $1,000       $500 Property A2.......................................      4,000      1,500 Property A3.......................................      4,000      6,000 Property A4.......................................      6,000      4,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The character of gain or loss on Properties A1, A2, and A3 is  long-term, U.S.-source capital gain or loss. The character of gain on  Property A4 is long-term, foreign-source capital gain. B contributes  Property B, nondepreciable real property with a fair market value and  adjusted tax basis of $15,000. C contributes $15,000 cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> On December 31, 1998, Property B is distributed to A in  complete liquidation of A's interest in the partnership. A recognizes  gain of $3,000 under section 737, an amount equal to the excess  distribution of $3,000 ($15,000 fair market value of Property B less  $12,000 adjusted tax basis in A's partnership interest) and A's net  precontribution gain of $3,000 ($15,000 aggregate fair market value of  the property contributed by A less $12,000 aggregate adjusted tax basis  of such property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> $2,000 of A's gain is long-term, foreign-source capital gain  ($3,000 total gain under section 737 x $2,000 net long-term, foreign- source capital gain/$3,000 total net precontribution gain). $1,000 of  A's gain is long-term, U.S.-source capital gain ($3,000 total gain under  section 737 x $1,000 net long-term, U.S.-source capital gain/$3,000  total net precontribution gain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The partnership must increase the adjusted tax basis of the  property contributed by A by $3,000. All property contributed by A is  eligible property. Properties A1, A2, and A3 have the same character and  are grouped into a single group for purposes of allocating this basis  increase. Property A4 is in a separate character group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> $2,000 of the basis increase must be allocated to long-term,  foreign-source capital assets because $2,000 of the gain recognized by A  was long-term, foreign-source capital gain. The adjusted tax basis of  Property A4 is therefore increased from $4,000 to $6,000. $1,000 of the  increase must be allocated to   Properties A1 and A2 because $1,000 of the gain recognized by A is long- term, U.S.-source capital gain. No basis increase is allocated to  Property A3 because its fair market value is less than its adjusted tax  basis. The $1,000 basis increase is allocated between Properties A1 and  A2 based on the unrealized appreciation in each asset before such basis  adjustment. As a result, the adjusted tax basis of Property A1 is  increased by $167 ($1,000x$500/$3,000) and the adjusted tax basis of  Property A2 is increased by $833 ($1,000x$2,500/3,000).
