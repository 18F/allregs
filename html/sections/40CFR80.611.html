Compliance with the standards, dye, and marker requirements in Sec.

Any evidence or information, including the exclusive use of such evidence or information, may be used to establish the level of the applicable component or parameter in the diesel fuel or additive, or motor oil to be used in diesel fuel, if the evidence or information is relevant to whether that level would have been in compliance with the standard if the regulatory sampling and testing methodology had been correctly performed. Such evidence may be obtained from any source or location and may include, but is not limited to, test results using methods other than the compliance methods in this paragraph (a), business records, and commercial documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance with other requirements.
