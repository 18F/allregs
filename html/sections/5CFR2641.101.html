                            <p class="depth0">18 U.S.C. 207 prohibits certain acts by former employees (including  current employees who formerly served in ``senior'' or ``very senior''  employee positions) which involve, or may appear to involve, the unfair  use of prior Government employment. None of the restrictions of section  207 prohibits any former employee, regardless of Government rank or  position, from accepting employment with any particular private or  public employer. Rather, section 207 prohibits a former employee from  providing certain services to or on behalf of non-Federal employers or  other persons, whether or not done for compensation. These restrictions  are personal to the employee and are not imputed to others. (See,  however, the note following Sec. 2641.103 concerning 18 U.S.C. 2.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part 2641 explains the scope and content of 18 U.S.C. 207  as it applies to former employees of the executive branch or of certain  independent agencies (including current employees who formerly served in  ``senior'' or ``very senior'' employee positions). Although certain  restrictions in section 207 apply to former employees of the District of  Columbia, Members and elected officials of the Congress and certain  legislative staff, and employees of independent agencies in the  legislative and judicial branches, this part is not intended to provide  guidance to those individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Part 2641 does not address post-employment restrictions that may  be contained in laws or authorities other than 18 U.S.C. 207. These  restrictions include those in 18 U.S.C. 203 and 41 U.S.C. 423(d).</p>
