                                Sec.  63.1111  Startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and  modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate  production affected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct  malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence, in order to  minimize excess emissions of regulated organic HAP; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of  startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to  restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to  its normal or usual manner of operation).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation of source. During periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to this  subpart YY shall operate and maintain such affected source (including  associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in a manner  consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for  minimizing emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to  minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction  does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that  would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is  not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor  does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to  reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been  achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance  procedures are being used will be based on information available to the  Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring  results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the  startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by this section),  review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the  source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of additional procedures. To satisfy the requirements of  this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the  owner or operator of an affected source may use the affected source's  standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative  plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available  for inspection when requested by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of  the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the affected source  that has occurred; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fails to provide for the operation of the affected source  (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a  startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with  good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the  extent practical; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting  malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as  practicable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize  excess emissions to the extent practical as specified in Sec.   63.1108(a)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Additional malfunction plan requirements. If the startup,  shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately  addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but  was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the  time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator  shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days  after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and  maintaining the affected source during similar malfunction events and a  program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air  pollution control equipment or CPMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> apply to all affected sources except  for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and  polycarbonate production affected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other  responsible official certifying its accuracy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(C)</em> and  (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Total duration of periods of malfunctioning of a CPMS equal to  or greater than 5 percent of that CPMS operating time for the reporting  period; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Total duration of periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction  for an affected source equal to or greater than 1 percent of that  affected source's operating time for the reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Records documenting each startup, shutdown and malfunction  event as required under Sec.  63.998(c)(1)(ii)(F).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Records documenting the total duration of operating time as  required under Sec.  63.998(c)(1)(ii)(H).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.  Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for  startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a  startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a  malfunction) during which excess emissions occur is not consistent with  the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, the owner or  operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working  days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a  letter delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of  the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph shall  contain the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other  responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the  circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup,  shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or  parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred.  Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the  effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an  affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative  reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in  that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative  reporting requirements under this paragraph are specified in Sec.   63.1110(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production  affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable  standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the  date, time, and duration of each failure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and  retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the  quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit,  and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with  Sec.  63.1108(a)(4)(ii), and any corrective actions taken to return the  affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reports of malfunctions. If a source fails to meet an applicable  standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number  of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report  the date, time and duration of each failure. For each failure the report  must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of  the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission  limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
