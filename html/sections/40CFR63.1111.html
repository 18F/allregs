                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. The requirements of this paragraph (a) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description and purpose of plan. The owner or operator of an affected source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. This plan shall also include a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with relevant standards under this subpart. The plan shall also address routine or otherwise predictable CPMS malfunctions. This plan shall be developed by the owner or operator by the affected source's compliance date under this subpart. The requirement to develop this plan shall be incorporated into the source's title V permit. This requirement is optional for equipment that must comply with subparts TT or UU under this subpart. It is not optional for equipment equipped with a closed vent system and control device subject to this subpart and subpart SS of this part. The purpose of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence, in order to minimize excess emissions of regulated organic HAP; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation of source. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart YY shall operate and maintain such affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical. The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of additional procedures. To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator of an affected source may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Revisions to the plan. Based on the results of a determination made under Sec.  63.1108(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of an affected source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as

specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the affected source that has occurred; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fails to provide for the operation of the affected source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified in Sec.  63.1108(a)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Additional malfunction plan requirements. If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the affected source during similar malfunction events and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control equipment or CPMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements. The requirements of this paragraph (b) apply to all affected sources except for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reporting requirements. If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction of an affected source, or of a control device or monitoring system required for compliance (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, then the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. During the reporting period, reports shall only be required for startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions during which excess emissions, as defined in Sec.  63.1108(a)(5), occur during the reporting period. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction report can be submitted as part of a Periodic Report required under Sec.  63.1110(a)(5), or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise under this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the affected source's title V permit. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate), unless the information is submitted with the Periodic Report. The report shall include the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official certifying its accuracy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period if the total duration amounts to either of the durations in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. Records of the number of CPMS startup, shutdown, and malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period are required under Sec.  63.998(c)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Total duration of periods of malfunctioning of a CPMS equal to or greater than 5 percent of that CPMS operating time for the reporting period; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Total duration of periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for an affected source equal to or greater than 1 percent of that affected source's operating time for the reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Records documenting each startup, shutdown and malfunction event as required under Sec.  63.998(c)(1)(ii)(F).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Records documenting the total duration of operating time as required under Sec.  63.998(c)(1)(ii)(H).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports. Notwithstanding the allowance to reduce the frequency of reporting for startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any time an action taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) during which excess emissions occur is not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent with the plan, followed by a letter delivered or postmarked within 7 working days after the end of the event. The immediate report required under this paragraph shall contain the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, explaining the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred. Notwithstanding the requirements of the previous sentence, after the effective date of an approved permit program in the State in which an affected source is located, the owner or operator may make alternative reporting arrangements, in advance, with the permitting authority in that State. Procedures governing the arrangement of alternative reporting requirements under this paragraph are specified in Sec.  63.1110(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Malfunction recordkeeping and reporting. The requirements of this paragraph (c) apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records of malfunctions. The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, time, and duration of each failure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with Sec.  63.1108(a)(4)(ii), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reports of malfunctions. If a source fails to meet an applicable standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time and duration of each failure. For each failure the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.
