                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Suspension and termination for cause. DOE may suspend or  terminate an award for cause on the basis of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A noncompliance determination under Sec. 600.24,  Sec. 600.122(n), Sec. 600.162(a), Sec. 600.243(a) or Sec. 600.352(a); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A suspension or debarment of the awardee under 2 CFR 180 and  901.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification requirements. Except as provided in Sec. 600.24,  Sec. 600.162(a), Sec. 600.243(a), or Sec. 600.352(a) before suspending  or terminating an award for cause, DOE shall mail to the awardee (by  certified mail, return receipt requested) a separate written notice in  addition to that required by Sec. 600.24(a) at least ten days prior to  the effective date of the suspension or termination. Such notice shall  include, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The factual and legal bases for the suspension or termination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date or dates of the DOE action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the action does not apply to the entire award, a description  of the activities affected by the action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Instructions concerning which costs shall be allowable during  the period of suspension, or instructions concerning allowable  termination costs, including in either case, instructions concerning any  subgrants or contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Instructions concerning required final reports and other  closeout actions for terminated awards (see Secs. 600.170 through  600.173, Secs. 600.250 through 600.252 and Secs. 600.350 through  600.353;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement of the awardee's right to appeal a termination for  cause pursuant to Sec. 600.22; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The dated signature of a DOE Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suspension. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless DOE and the awardee agree otherwise, no  period of suspension shall exceed 90 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOE may cancel the suspension at any time, up to and including  the date of expiration of the period of suspension, if the awardee takes  satisfactory corrective action before the expiration date of the  suspension or gives DOE satisfactory evidence that such corrective  action will be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the suspension has not been cancelled by the expiration date  of the period of suspension, the awardee shall resume the suspended  activities or project unless, prior to the expiration date, DOE notifies  the awardee in writing that the period of suspension shall be extended  consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that the award shall  be terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As of the effective date of the suspension, DOE shall withhold  further payments and shall allow new obligations incurred by the awardee  during the period of suspension only if such costs were authorized in  the notice of suspension or in a subsequent letter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the suspension is cancelled or expires and the award is not  terminated, DOE shall reimburse the awardee for any authorized allowable  costs incurred during the suspension and, if necessary, may amend the  award to extend the period of performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination by mutual agreement.

If the  awardee initiates a termination, the awardee must notify DOE in writing  and specify the awardee's reasons for   requesting the termination, the proposed effective date of the  termination, and, in the case of a partial termination, a description of  the activities to be terminated, and an appropriate budget revision. DOE  shall terminate an award or portion thereof under this paragraph only if  both parties agree to the termination and the conditions under which it  shall occur. If DOE determines that the remaining activities under a  partially terminated award would not accomplish the purpose for which  the award was originally awarded, DOE may terminate the entire award.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of termination. The awardee shall incur no new  obligations after the effective date of the termination of an award (or  portion thereof), and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as  possible. DOE shall allow full credit to the awardee for the DOE share  of noncancellable obligations properly incurred by the awardee prior to  the effective date of the termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subgrants. Awardees shall follow the policies and procedures in  this section and in Secs. 600.24, 600.160 through 600.162 Secs. 600.243  through 600.244 or Secs. 600.350 through 600.353 for suspending and  terminating subgrants.
