                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contract clause. The contracting agency shall include the Executive Order minimum wage contract clause set forth in appendix A of this part in all covered contracts and solicitations for such contracts, as described in Sec. 10.3, except for procurement contracts subject to the FAR. The required contract clause directs, as a condition of payment, that all workers performing work on or in connection with covered contracts must be paid the applicable, currently effective minimum wage under Executive Order 13658 and Sec. 10.5. For procurement contracts subject to the FAR, contracting agencies must use the clause set forth in the FAR developed to implement this rule. Such clause will accomplish the same purposes as the clause set forth in Appendix A and be consistent with the requirements set forth in this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Failure to include the contract clause. Where the Department or the contracting agency discovers or determines, whether before or subsequent to a contract award, that a contracting agency made an erroneous determination that Executive Order 13658 or this part did not apply to a particular contract and/or failed to include the applicable contract clause in a contract to which the Executive Order applies, the contracting agency, on its own initiative or within 15 calendar days of notification by an authorized representative of the Department of Labor, shall incorporate the contract clause in the contract retroactive to commencement of performance under the contract through the exercise of any and all authority that may be needed (including, where necessary, its authority to negotiate or amend, its authority to pay any necessary additional costs, and its authority under any contract provision authorizing changes, cancellation and termination).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Withholding. A contracting officer shall upon his or her own action or upon written request of an authorized representative of the Department of Labor withhold or cause to be withheld from the prime contractor under the covered contract or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay workers the full amount of wages required by the Executive Order. In the event of failure to pay any covered workers all or part of the wages due under Executive Order 13658, the agency may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 13658 may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the contracting agency may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the contractor in default with any additional cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Actions on complaints--(1) Reporting--(i) Reporting time frame. The contracting agency shall forward all information listed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of

this section to the Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210 within 14 calendar days of receipt of a complaint alleging contractor noncompliance with the Executive Order or this part or within 14 calendar days of being contacted by the Wage and Hour Division regarding any such complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Report contents. The contracting agency shall forward to the Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210 any:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Complaint of contractor noncompliance with Executive Order 13658 or this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Available statements by the worker, contractor, or any other person regarding the alleged violation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Evidence that the Executive Order minimum wage contract clause was included in the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Information concerning known settlement negotiations between the parties, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any other relevant facts known to the contracting agency or other information requested by the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p>
