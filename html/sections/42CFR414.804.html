                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculation of manufacturer's average sales price. (1) The manufacturer's average sales price for a quarter for a drug represented by a particular 11-digit National Drug Code must be calculated as the manufacturer's sales to all purchasers in the United States for that particular 11-digit National Drug Code (after excluding sales as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and then deducting price concessions as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section) divided by the total number of units sold by the manufacturer in that quarter (after excluding units associated with sales as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer's average sales price for a quarter for a drug represented by a particular 11-digit National Drug Code must be calculated as the manufacturer's sales to all purchasers in the United States for that particular 11-digit National Drug Code (after excluding sales as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and then deducting price concessions as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section) divided by the total number of units sold by the manufacturer in that quarter (after excluding units associated with sales as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Price concessions. (i) In calculating the manufacturer's average sales price, a manufacturer must deduct price concessions. Price concessions include the following types of transactions and items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In calculating the manufacturer's average sales price, a manufacturer must deduct price concessions. Price concessions include the following types of transactions and items:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Volume discounts.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Prompt pay discounts.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Cash discounts.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Free goods that are contingent on any purchase requirement.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Chargebacks and rebates (other than rebates under the Medicaid program).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i), bona fide services fees are not considered price concessions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that data on price concessions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, are available on a lagged basis, the manufacturer must estimate this amount in accordance with the methodology described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> For each National Drug Code with at least 12 months of sales (including products for which the manufacturer has redesignated the National Drug Code for the specific product and package size and has 12 months of sales across the prior and current National Drug Codes), after adjusting for exempted sales, the manufacturer calculates a percentage equal to the sum of the price concessions for the most recent 12-month period available associated with sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement divided by the total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement for the same 12-month period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For each National Drug Code with at least 12 months of sales (including products for which the manufacturer has redesignated the National Drug Code for the specific product and package size and has 12 months of sales across the prior and current National Drug Codes), after adjusting for exempted sales, the manufacturer calculates a percentage equal to the sum of the price concessions for the most recent 12-month period available associated with sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement divided by the total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement for the same 12-month period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For each National Drug Code with less than 12 months of sales, the calculation described in paragraph (i)(A) of this section is performed for the time period equaling the total number of months of sales.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer multiplies the applicable percentage described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) or (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section by the total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement (after adjusting for exempted sales) for the quarter being submitted. (The manufacturer must carry a sufficient number of decimal places in the calculation of the price concessions percentage in order to round accurately the net total sales amount for the quarter to the nearest whole dollar.) The result of this multiplication is then subtracted from the total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement (after adjusting for exempted sales) for the quarter being submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer uses the result of the calculation described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section as the numerator and the number of units sold in the quarter (after adjusting for exempted sales) as the denominator to calculate the manufacturer's average sales price for the National Drug Code for the quarter being submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Example. After adjusting for exempted sales, the total lagged price concessions (discounts, rebates, etc.) over the most recent 12-month period available associated with sales for National Drug Code 12345-6789-01 subject to the ASP reporting requirement equal $200,000, and the total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement for the same period equals $600,000. The lagged price concessions percentage for this period equals 200,000/600,000 = 0.33333. The total in dollars for the sales subject to the average sales price reporting requirement for the quarter being reported, equals $50,000 for 10,000 units sold. The manufacturer's average sales price calculation for this National Drug Code for this quarter is: $50,000-(0.33333 x $50,000) = $33,334 (net total sales amount); $33,334/10,000 = $3.33 (average sales price).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exempted sales. (i) In calculating the manufacturer's average sales price, a manufacturer must exclude sales that are exempt from inclusion in the determination of the best price under section 1927(c)(1)(C)(i) of the Act and sales that are merely nominal in amount as applied for purposes of section 1927(c)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of the Act, as limited by section 1927(c)(1)(D) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In calculating the manufacturer's average sales price, a manufacturer must exclude sales that are exempt from inclusion in the determination of the best price under section 1927(c)(1)(C)(i) of the Act and sales that are merely nominal in amount as applied for purposes of section 1927(c)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of the Act, as limited by section 1927(c)(1)(D) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In determining nominal sales exempted under section 1927(c)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of the Act, the manufacturer calculates the average manufacturer price as defined in section 1927(k) of the Act and then identifies sales that are eligible to be considered a nominal sale under section 1927(c)(1)(D) of the Act and are at less than 10 percent of the average manufacturer price. To identify nominal sales, the manufacturer must use the average manufacturer price for the calendar quarter that is the same calendar quarter as the average sales price reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The manufacturer's average sales price must be calculated by the manufacturer every calendar quarter and submitted to CMS within 30 days of the close of the quarter. The first quarter submission must be submitted by April 30, 2004. Subsequent reports are due not later than 30 days after the last day of each calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The manufacturer's average sales price must be calculated based on the amount of product in a vial or other container as conspicuously reflected on the FDA approved label as defined by section 201(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each report must be certified by one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer's Chief Executive Officer (CEO).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer's Chief Financial Officer (CFO).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An individual who has delegated authority to sign for, and who reports directly to, the manufacturer's CEO or CFO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
