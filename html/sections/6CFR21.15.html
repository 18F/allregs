                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing  is required by Sec. 21.13(c), reasonable notice shall be given by  registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected  applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or  recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision  under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the  matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice  within which the applicant or recipient may request of the Secretary  that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question  has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and  place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for  cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place  of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit  written information and argument for the record. The failure of an  applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to  appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be  a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and  Sec. 21.13(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of  such information as is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices  of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the Secretary  unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient  or of the Department requires that another place be selected. Hearings  shall be held before the Secretary, or at his discretion, before a  hearing examiner appointed in accordance with section 3105 of title 5,  United States Code, or detailed under section 3344 of title 5, United  States Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the  applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be  represented by counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures, evidence, and record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hearing, decision, and  any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with  sections 554 through 557 of title 5, United States Code, and in  accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not  inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing,  giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of  this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs,  requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department  and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all  relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or  as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or  during the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted  pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure  production of the most   credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross- examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer  conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant,  immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other  evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by  the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments  advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the  oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated  for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and  written findings shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or  related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part  with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other  means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which  this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations  of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title  VI of the Act, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other  departments or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of  consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings  of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions  in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in  accordance with Sec. 21.17.</p>
