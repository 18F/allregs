                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In making an arrest, the security force personnel should announce their authority and that the person is under arrest prior to taking the person into custody. If the circumstances are such that making such an announcement would be useless or dangerous to the security force personnel or others, the security force personnel may dispense with these announcements, but must subsequently identify themselves and their arrest authority to the arrested person(s) as soon as reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The security force personnel at the time and place of arrest may search the arrested person and the area immediately surrounding the arrested person for weapons and criminal evidence. This is to protect the arresting officer and to prevent the destruction of evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Custody of the person arrested should be transferred to other Federal law enforcement personnel (e.g., United States Marshals or FBI agents) or to local law enforcement agency personnel, as appropriate, as soon as possible, in order to ensure the person is brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.
