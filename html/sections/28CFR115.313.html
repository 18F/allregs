In calculating

adequate staffing levels and determining the need for video monitoring, facilities shall take into consideration:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally accepted juvenile detention and correctional/secure residential practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any judicial findings of inadequacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any findings of inadequacy from Federal investigative agencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any findings of inadequacy from internal or external oversight bodies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All components of the facility's physical plant (including ``blind spots'' or areas where staff or residents may be isolated);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The composition of the resident population;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The number and placement of supervisory staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Institution programs occurring on a particular shift;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any applicable State or local laws, regulations, or standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The prevalence of substantiated and unsubstantiated incidents of sexual abuse; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Any other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The agency shall comply with the staffing plan except during limited and discrete exigent circumstances, and shall fully document deviations from the plan during such circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each secure juvenile facility shall maintain staff ratios of a minimum of 1:8 during resident waking hours and 1:16 during resident sleeping hours, except during limited and discrete exigent circumstances, which shall be fully documented. Only security staff shall be included in these ratios. Any facility that, as of the date of publication of this final rule, is not already obligated by law, regulation, or judicial consent decree to maintain the staffing ratios set forth in this paragraph shall have until October 1, 2017, to achieve compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever necessary, but no less frequently than once each year, for each facility the agency operates, in consultation with the PREA coordinator required by Sec. 115.311, the agency shall assess, determine, and document whether adjustments are needed to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The staffing plan established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prevailing staffing patterns;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The facility's deployment of video monitoring systems and other monitoring technologies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The resources the facility has available to commit to ensure adherence to the staffing plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each secure facility shall implement a policy and practice of having intermediate-level or higher level supervisors conduct and document unannounced rounds to identify and deter staff sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Such policy and practice shall be implemented for night shifts as well as day shifts. Each secure facility shall have a policy to prohibit staff from alerting other staff members that these supervisory rounds are occurring, unless such announcement is related to the legitimate operational functions of the facility.
