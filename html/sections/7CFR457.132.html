Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(1) by the price election;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Multiplying the total production to be counted, (see section 10(c)) by the price election;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subtracting the total in section 10(b)(3) from the total in section 10(b)(2); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Multiplying the result in section 10(b)(4) by your share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The total production to count (in barrels) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All appraised production as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Damaged solely by uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For which you fail to provide acceptable production records; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Destroyed or put to another use without our consent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unharvested production; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we will use the appraised amount of production or defer the claim if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general to the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Harvested production which, due to insurable causes, is determined not to meet the United States Standards for Fresh Cranberries if available, or would not meet those standards if properly handled, or does not meet the quality requirements of the receiving handler if the United States Standards for Fresh Cranberries, if not available, and

such harvested production has a value less than 75 percent of the market price for cranberries meeting the minimum requirements will be adjusted by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dividing the value per barrel of such cranberries by the market price per barrel for cranberries meeting the minimum requirements; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiplying the result by the number of barrels of such cranberries.</p><p class="depth4">11.
