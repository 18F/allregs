                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each holder of a construction permit or operating license for a nuclear power reactor issued under this part or a combined license for a nuclear power reactor issued under part 52 of this chapter, shall comply with either 10 CFR 70.24 of this chapter or the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each licensee shall comply with the following requirements in lieu of maintaining a monitoring system capable of detecting a criticality as described in 10 CFR 70.24:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plant procedures shall prohibit the handling and storage at any one time of more fuel assemblies than have been determined to be safely subcritical under the most adverse moderation conditions feasible by unborated water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated ratio of neutron production to neutron absorption and leakage (k-effective) of the fresh fuel in the fresh fuel storage racks shall be calculated assuming the racks are loaded with fuel of the maximum fuel assembly reactivity and flooded with unborated water and must not exceed 0.95, at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent confidence level. This evaluation need not be performed if administrative controls and/or design features prevent such flooding or if fresh fuel storage racks are not used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If optimum moderation of fresh fuel in the fresh fuel storage racks occurs when the racks are assumed to be loaded with fuel of the maximum fuel assembly reactivity and filled with low-density hydrogenous fluid, the k-effective corresponding to this optimum moderation must not exceed 0.98, at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent confidence level. This evaluation need not be performed if administrative controls and/or design features prevent such moderation or if fresh fuel storage racks are not used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If no credit for soluble boron is taken, the k-effective of the spent fuel storage racks loaded with fuel of the maximum fuel assembly reactivity must not exceed 0.95, at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent confidence level, if flooded with unborated water. If credit is taken for soluble boron, the k-effective of the spent fuel storage racks loaded with fuel of the maximum fuel assembly reactivity must not exceed 0.95, at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent confidence level, if flooded with borated water, and the k-effective must remain below 1.0 (subcritical), at a 95 percent probability, 95 percent confidence level, if flooded with unborated water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The quantity of SNM, other than nuclear fuel stored onsite, is less than the quantity necessary for a critical mass.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Radiation monitors are provided in storage and associated handling areas when fuel is present to detect excessive radiation levels and to initiate appropriate safety actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The maximum nominal U-235 enrichment of the fresh fuel assemblies is limited to five (5.0) percent by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The FSAR is amended no later than the next update which Sec. 50.71(e) of this part requires, indicating that the licensee has chosen to comply with Sec. 50.68(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> While a spent fuel transportation package approved under Part 71 of this chapter or spent fuel storage cask approved under Part 72 of this chapter is in the spent fuel pool:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirements in Sec. 50.68(b) do not apply to the fuel located within that package or cask; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirements in Part 71 or 72 of this chapter, as applicable, and the requirements of the Certificate of Compliance for that package or cask, apply to the fuel within that package or cask.
