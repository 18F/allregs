                                Sec. 241.11  Detention and removal of stowaways.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Presentation of stowaways. The owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft (referred to in this section as the carrier) bringing any alien stowaway to the United States is required to detain the stowaway on board the vessel or aircraft, at the expense of the owner of the vessel or aircraft, until completion of the inspection of the alien by an immigration officer. If detention on board the vessel or aircraft pending inspection is not possible, the carrier shall advise the Service of this fact without delay, and the Service may authorize that the carrier detain the stowaway at another designated location, at the expense of the owner, until the immigration officer arrives. No notice to detain the alien shall be required. Failure to detain an alien stowaway pending inspection shall result in a civil penalty under section 243(c)(1)(A) of the Act. The owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft must present the stowaway for inspection, along with any documents or evidence of identity or nationality in the possession of the alien or obtained by the carrier relating to the alien stowaway, and must provide any available information concerning the alien's boarding or apprehension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Removal of stowaways from vessel or aircraft for medical treatment. The district director may parole an alien stowaway into the United States for medical treatment, but the costs of detention and treatment of the alien stowaway shall be at the expense of the owner of the vessel or aircraft, and such removal of the stowaway from the vessel or aircraft does not relieve the carrier of the requirement to remove the stowaway from the United States once such medical treatment has been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Repatriation of stowaways--(1) Requirements of carrier. Following inspection, an immigration officer may order the owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft bringing any alien stowaway to the United States to remove the stowaway on the vessel or aircraft of arrival, unless it is impracticable to do so or other factors exist which would preclude removal on the same vessel or aircraft. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, sanitation, health, and safety concerns

for the crew and/or stowaway, whether the stowaway is a female or a juvenile, loss of insurance coverage on account of the stowaway remaining aboard, need for repairs to the vessel, and other similar circumstances. If the owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee requests that he or she be allowed to remove the stowaway by other means, the Service shall favorably consider any such request, provided the carrier has obtained, or will obtain in a timely manner, any necessary travel documents and has made or will make all transportation arrangements. The owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee shall transport the stowaway or arrange for secure escort of the stowaway to the vessel or aircraft of departure to ensure that the stowaway departs the United States. All expenses relating to removal shall be borne by the owner. Other than requiring compliance with the detention and removal requirements contained in section 241(d)(2) of the Act, the Service shall not impose additional conditions on the carrier regarding security arrangements. Failure to comply with an order to remove an alien stowaway shall result in a civil penalty under section 243(c)(1)(A) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements of carrier.

Failure to comply with an order to remove an alien stowaway shall result in a civil penalty under section 243(c)(1)(A) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Detention of stowaways ordered removed. If detention of the stowaway is required pending removal on other than the vessel or aircraft of arrival, or if the stowaway is to be removed on the vessel or aircraft of arrival but departure of the vessel or aircraft is not imminent and circumstances preclude keeping the stowaway on board the vessel or aircraft, the Service shall take the stowaway into Service custody. The owner is responsible for all costs of maintaining and detaining the stowaway pending removal, including costs for stowaways seeking asylum as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Such costs will be limited to those normally incurred in the detention of an alien by the Service, including, but not limited to, housing, food, transportation, medical expenses, and other reasonable costs incident to the detention of the stowaway. The Service may require the posting of a bond or other surety to ensure payment of costs of detention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stowaways claiming asylum--(1) Referral for credible fear determination. A stowaway who indicates an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution or torture upon return to his or her native country or country of last habitual residence (if not a national of any country) shall be removed from the vessel or aircraft of arrival in accordance with Sec. 208.5(b) of this chapter. The immigration officer shall refer the alien to an asylum officer for a determination of credible fear in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec. 208.30 of this chapter. The stowaway shall be detained in the custody of the Service pending the credible fear determination and any review thereof. Parole of such alien, in accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act, may be permitted only when the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of discretion, that parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a legitimate law enforcement objective. A stowaway who has established a credible fear of persecution or torture in accordance with Sec. 208.30 of this chapter may be detained or paroled pursuant to Sec. 212.5 of this chapter during any consideration of the asylum application. In determining whether to detain or parole the alien, the Service shall consider the likelihood that the alien will abscond or pose a security risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Referral for credible fear determination.

The owner of the vessel or aircraft that brought the stowaway to the United States shall reimburse the Service for the costs of maintaining and detaining the stowaway pending a determination of credible fear under section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act, up to a maximum period of 72 hours. The owner is also responsible for the costs of maintaining and detaining the stowaway during the period in which the stowaway is pursuing his or her asylum application, for a maximum period of 15 working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The 15-day period shall begin on the day following the day in which the alien is determined to have a credible fear of persecution by the asylum officer, or by the immigration judge if such review was requested by the alien pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the Act, but

not later than 72 hours after the stowaway was initially presented to the Service for inspection. Following the determination of credible fear, if the stowaway's application for asylum is not adjudicated within 15 working days, the Service shall pay the costs of detention beyond this time period. If the stowaway is determined not to have a credible fear of persecution, or if the stowaway's application for asylum is denied, including any appeals, the carrier shall be notified and shall arrange for repatriation of the stowaway at the expense of the owner of the vessel or aircraft on which the stowaway arrived.
