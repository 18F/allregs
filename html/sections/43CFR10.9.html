                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section carries out section 5 of the Act. Under  section 5 of the Act, each museum or Federal agency that has possession  or control over holdings or collections of human remains and associated  funerary objects must compile an inventory of such objects, and, to the  fullest extent possible based on information possessed by the museum or  Federal agency, must identify the geographical and cultural affiliation  of each item. The purpose of the inventory is to facilitate repatriation  by providing clear descriptions of human remains and associated funerary  objects and establishing the cultural affiliation between these objects  and present-day Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Museums  and Federal agencies are encouraged to produce inventories first on  those portions of their collections for which information is readily  available or about which Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations  have expressed special interest. Early focus on these parts of  collections will result in determinations that may serve as models for  other inventories. Federal agencies must ensure that these requirements  are met for all collections from their lands or generated by their  actions whether the collections are held by the Federal agency or by a  non-Federal institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consultation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consulting parties. Museum and Federal agency  officials must consult with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lineal descendants of individuals whose remains and associated  funerary objects are likely to be subject to the inventory provisions of  these regulations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indian tribe officials and traditional religious leaders:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> From whose tribal lands the human remains and associated  funerary objects originated;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> That are, or are likely to be, culturally affiliated with human  remains and associated funerary objects; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> From whose aboriginal lands the human remains and associated  funerary objects originated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initiation of consultation. Museum and Federal agency officials  must begin inventory consultation as early as possible, no later in the  inventory process than the time at which investigation into the cultural  affiliation of human remains and associated funerary objects is being  conducted. Consultation may be initiated with a letter, but should be  followed up by telephone or face-to-face dialogue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provision of information. During inventory consultation, museums  and Federal agency officials must provide the following information in  writing to lineal descendants, when known, and to officials and  traditional religious leaders representing Indian tribes or Native  Hawaiian organizations that are, or are likely to be, culturally  affiliated with the human remains and associated funerary objects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A list of all Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations  that are, or have been, consulted regarding the particular human remains  and associated funerary objects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A general description of the conduct of the inventory;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The projected time frame for conducting the inventory; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An indication that additional documentation used to identify  cultural affiliation will be supplied upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for information.

The following documentation must be  included, if available, for all inventories completed by museum or  Federal agency officials:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accession and catalogue entries, including the accession/ catalogue entries of human remains with which funerary objects were  associated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information related to the acquisition of each object,  including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the person or organization from whom the object was  obtained, if known;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of acquisition,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The place each object was acquired, i.e., name or number of  site, county, State, and Federal agency administrative unit, if  applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The means of acquisition, i.e., gift, purchase, or excavation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of each set of human remains or associated  funerary object, including dimensions, materials, and, if appropriate,  photographic documentation, and the antiquity of such human remains or  associated funerary objects, if known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A summary of the evidence, including the results of  consultation, used to determine the cultural affiliation of the human  remains and associated funerary objects pursuant to Sec. 10.14 of these  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documents.
