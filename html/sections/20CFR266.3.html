Evidence of the appointment of a  legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the  person or estate of an incompetent or a minor shall be a certified copy  of the court's determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical evidence. The Board may use medical evidence, when such  is available, to help determine whether an annuitant is capable of  managing or directing the management of benefit payments. For example, a  statement by a physician or other medical professional based upon his or  her recent examination of the annuitant and his or her knowledge of the  annuitant's present condition will be used in the Board's determination,  if it includes information concerning the nature of the annuitant's  illness, the annuitant's chances for recovery and the opinion of the  physician or other medical professional as to whether the annuitant is  able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other evidence. The Board may also consider statements of  relatives, friends, and other people in a position to know and observe  the annuitant, which contain information helpful to the Board in  deciding whether the annuitant is able to manage or direct the  management of benefit payments.</p>
