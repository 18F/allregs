                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assuring pharmacy access--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Standards for convenient access to  network pharmacies. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this  section, a Part D sponsor (as defined in Sec. 423.4 of this part) must  have a contracted pharmacy network consisting of retail pharmacies  sufficient to ensure that, for beneficiaries residing in each State in a  PDP sponsor's service area (as defined in Sec. 423.112(a) of this part),  each State in a regional MA-organization's service area (as defined in  Sec. 422.2 of this part), the entire service area of a local MA  organization (as defined in Sec. 422.2 of this chapter) or the entire  geographic area of a cost contract (as defined in Sec. 417.401 of this  chapter) all of the following requirements are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At least 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, on average, in  urban areas served by the Part D sponsor live within 2 miles of a  network pharmacy that is a retail pharmacy or a pharmacy described under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, on average, in  suburban areas served by the Part D sponsor live within 5 miles of a  network pharmacy that is a retail pharmacy or a pharmacy described under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At least 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, on average, in  rural areas served by the Part D sponsor live within 15 miles of a  network pharmacy that is a retail pharmacy or a pharmacy described under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability of some non-retail pharmacies to standards for  convenient access. Part D sponsors may count I/T/U pharmacies and  pharmacies operated by Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural  Health Centers toward the standards for convenient access to network  pharmacies in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Access to non-retail pharmacies. A Part D sponsor's contracted  pharmacy network may be supplemented by non-retail pharmacies, including  pharmacies offering home delivery via mail-order and institutional  pharmacies, provided the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this  section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Access to home infusion pharmacies. A Part D sponsor's  contracted pharmacy network must provide adequate access to home  infusion pharmacies consistent with written policy guidelines and other  CMS instructions. A Part D plan must ensure that such network  pharmacies, at a minimum meet all the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are capable of delivering home-infused drugs in a form that can  be administered in a clinically appropriate fashion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are capable of providing infusible Part D drugs for both short- term acute care and long-term chronic care therapies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that the professional services and ancillary supplies  necessary for home infusion therapy are in place before dispensing Part  D home infusion drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provide delivery of home infusion drugs within 24 hours of  discharge from an acute care setting, or later if so prescribed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Access to long-term care pharmacies. A Part D sponsor must offer  standard contracting terms and conditions, including performance and  service criteria for long-term care pharmacies that CMS specifies, to  all long-term care pharmacies in its service area. The sponsor must  provide convenient access to long-term care pharmacies consistent with  written policy guidelines and other CMS instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Access to I/T/U pharmacies. A Part D sponsor must offer standard  contracting terms and conditions conforming to the model addendum that  CMS develops, to all I/T/U pharmacies in its service area. The sponsor  must provide convenient access to I/T/U pharmacies consistent with  written policy guidelines and other CMS instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Waiver of pharmacy access requirements. CMS waives the  requirements under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of  either of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An MA organization or cost contract (as described in section  1876(h) of the Act) that provides its enrollees with access to covered  Part D drugs through pharmacies owned and operated by the MA  organization or cost contract, provided the organization's or plan's  pharmacy network meets the access standard set forth--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At Sec. 422.112 of this chapter for an MA organization; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At Sec. 417.416(e) of this chapter for a cost contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An MA organization offering a private fee-for-service plan  described in Sec. 422.4 of this chapter that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Offers qualified prescription drug coverage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Provides plan enrollees with access to covered Part D drugs  dispensed at all pharmacies, without regard to whether they are  contracted network pharmacies and without charging cost-sharing in  excess of that described in Sec. 423.104(d)(2) and (d)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Pharmacy network contracting requirements. In establishing its  contracted pharmacy network, a Part D sponsor offering qualified  prescription drug coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Must contract with any pharmacy that meets the Part D sponsor's  standard terms and conditions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> May not require a pharmacy to accept insurance risk as a  condition of participation in the Part D sponsor's contracted pharmacy  network.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Differential cost-sharing for preferred pharmacies. A Part D  sponsor offering a Part D plan that provides coverage other than defined  standard coverage may reduce copayments or coinsurance for covered Part  D drugs obtained through a preferred pharmacy relative to the copayments  or coinsurance applicable for such drugs when obtained through a non- preferred pharmacy. Such differentials are taken into account in  determining whether the requirements under Sec. 423.104(d)(2) and (d)(5)  and Sec. 423.104(e) are met. Any cost-sharing reduction under this  section must not increase CMS payments to the Part D plan under  Sec. 423.329.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Level playing field between mail-order and network pharmacies.  A Part D sponsor must permit its Part D plan enrollees to receive  benefits, which may include a 90-day supply of covered Part D drugs, at  any of its network pharmacies that are retail pharmacies. A Part D  sponsor may require an enrollee obtaining a covered Part D drug at a  network pharmacy that is a retail pharmacy to pay any higher cost- sharing applicable to that covered Part D drug at the network pharmacy  that is a retail pharmacy instead of the cost-sharing applicable to that  covered Part D drug at the network pharmacy that is a mail-order  pharmacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Formulary requirements. A Part D sponsor that uses a formulary  under its qualified prescription drug coverage must meet the following  requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Development and revision by a pharmacy and therapeutic  committee. A Part D sponsor's formulary must be developed and reviewed  by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Includes a majority of members who are practicing physicians  and/or practicing pharmacists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Includes at least one practicing physician and at least one  practicing pharmacist who are independent and free of conflict relative  to-</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Part D sponsor and Part D plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Includes at least one practicing physician and one practicing  pharmacist who are experts regarding care of elderly or disabled  individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Clearly articulates and documents processes to determine that  the requirements under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this  section have been met, including the determination by an objective party  of whether disclosed financial interests are conflicts of interest and  the management of any recusals due to such conflicts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Bases clinical decisions on the strength of scientific evidence  and standards of practice, including assessing peer-reviewed medical  literature, pharmacoeconomic studies, outcomes research data, and other  such information as it determines appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Considers whether the inclusion of a particular Part D drug in  a formulary or formulary tier has any therapeutic advantages in terms of  safety and efficacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Reviews policies that guide exceptions and other utilization  management processes, including drug utilization review, quantity  limits, generic substitution, and therapeutic interchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Evaluates and analyzes treatment protocols and procedures  related to the plan's formulary at least annually consistent with  written policy guidelines and other CMS instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Documents in writing its decisions regarding formulary  development and revision and utilization management activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Reviews and approves all clinical prior authorization criteria,  step therapy protocols, and quantity limit restrictions applied to each  covered Part D drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Meets other requirements consistent with written policy  guidelines and other CMS instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provision of an Adequate Formulary. A Part D plan's formulary  must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (v) of this  section, include within each therapeutic category and class of Part D  drugs at least two Part D drugs that are not therapeutically equivalent  and bioequivalent, with different strengths and dosage forms available  for each of those drugs, except that only one Part D drug must be  included in a particular category or class of covered Part D drugs if  the category or class includes only one Part D drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Include at least one Part D drug within a particular category  or class of Part D drugs to the extent the Part D plan demonstrates, and  CMS approves, the following-</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That only two drugs are available in that category or class of  Part D drugs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That one drug is clinically superior to the other drug in that  category or class of Part D drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Include adequate coverage of the types of drugs most commonly  needed by Part D enrollees, as recognized in national treatment  guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Be approved by CMS consistent with Sec. 423.272(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Until such time as there are established, through notice and  comment rulemaking, criteria to identify, as appropriate, categories and  classes of clinical concern, the categories and classes of clinical  concern are as specified in section 1860D-4(b)(3)(G)(iv) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Exceptions to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Drug products that are rated as therapeutically equivalent  (under the Food and Drug Administration's most recent publication of  ``Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,''  also known as the Orange Book).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Utilization management processes that limit the quantity of  drugs due to safety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other drugs that CMS specifies through a process that is based  upon scientific evidence and medical standards of practice (and, in the  case of antiretroviral medications, is consistent with the Department of  Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral  Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents) and which permits  public notice and comment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transition process. A Part D sponsor must provide for an  appropriate transition process for enrollees prescribed Part D drugs  that are not on its Part D plan's formulary (including Part D drugs that  are on a sponsor's formulary but require prior authorization or step  therapy under a plan's utilization management rules). The transition  process must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be applicable to all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> New enrollees into Part D plans following the annual coordinated  election period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Newly eligible Medicare enrollees from other coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Individuals who switch from one plan to another after the start  of the contract year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Current enrollees remaining in the plan affected by formulary  changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure access to a temporary supply of drugs within the first  90 days of coverage under a new plan. This 90 day timeframe applies to  retail, home infusion, long-term care and mail-order pharmacies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure the provision of a temporary fill when an enrollee  requests a fill of a non-formulary drug during the time period specified  in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section (including Part D drugs that are  on a plan's formulary but require prior authorization or step therapy  under a plan's utilization management rules).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the outpatient setting, the one-time, temporary supply of  non-formulary Part D drugs (including Part D drugs that are on a  sponsor's formulary but require prior authorization or step therapy  under a sponsor's utilization management rules) must be for at least 30  days of medication, unless the prescription is written by a prescriber  for less than 30 days and requires the Part D sponsor to allow multiple  fills to provide up to a total of 30 days of medication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the long-term care setting, the temporary supply of non- formulary Part D drugs (including Part D drugs that are on a sponsor's  formulary but require prior authorization or step therapy under a  sponsor's utilization management rules) must be for up to at least 91  days and may be up to at least 98 days, consistent with the dispensing  increment, with refills provided, if needed, unless a lesser amount is  actually prescribed by the prescriber.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ensure written notice is provided to each affected enrollee  within 3 business days after adjudication of the temporary fill. For  long-term care residents dispensed multiple supplies of a Part D drug,  in increments of 14-days-or-less, consistent with the requirements under  Sec. 423.154, the written notice must be provided within 3 business days  after adjudication of the first temporary fill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ensure that reasonable efforts are made to notify prescribers of  affected enrollees who receive a transition notice under paragraph  (b)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A Part D sponsor must charge cost sharing for a temporary  supply of drugs provided under its transition process such that the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For low-income subsidy (LIS) enrollees, a sponsor must not  charge higher cost sharing for transition supplies than the statutory  maximum copayment amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For non-LIS enrollees, a sponsor must charge--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The same cost sharing for non-formulary Part D drugs provided  during the transition that would apply for non-formulary drugs approved  through a formulary exception in accordance with Sec. 423.578(b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The same cost sharing for formulary drugs subject to utilization  management edits provided during the transition that would apply once  the utilization management criteria are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation on changes in therapeutic classification. Except as  CMS may permit to account for new therapeutic uses and newly approved  Part D drugs, a Part D sponsor may not change the therapeutic categories  and classes in a formulary other than at the beginning of each plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Provision of notice regarding formulary changes (i) Prior to  removing a covered Part D drug from its Part D plan's formulary, or  making any change in the preferred or tiered cost-sharing status of a  covered Part D drug, a Part D sponsor must provide at least 60 days  notice to CMS, State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (as defined in  Sec. 423.454), entities providing other prescription drug coverage (as  described in Sec. 423.464(f)(1)), authorized prescribers, network  pharmacies, and pharmacists prior to the date such change becomes  effective, and must either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Provide direct written notice to affected enrollees at least 60  days prior to the date the change becomes effective; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At the time an affected enrollee requests a refill of the Part D  drug,   provide such enrollee with a 60 day supply of the Part D drug under the  same terms as previously allowed, and written notice of the formulary  change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The written notice must contain the following information-</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name of the affected covered Part D drug;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether the plan is removing the covered Part D drug from the  formulary, or changing its preferred or tiered cost-sharing status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The reason why the plan is removing such covered Part D drug  from the formulary, or changing its preferred or tiered cost-sharing  status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Alternative drugs in the same therapeutic category or class or  cost-sharing tier and expected cost-sharing for those drugs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The means by which enrollees may obtain a coverage determination  under Sec. 423.566 or exception under Sec. 423.578.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Part D sponsors may immediately remove from their Part D plan  formularies covered Part D drugs deemed unsafe by the Food and Drug  Administration or removed from the market by their manufacturer without  meeting the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) of this section.
