                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Special Warranty mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of Sec.  215.3 refers to the protective arrangements developed for application to  the Other Than Urbanized program. The warranty arrangement represents  the understandings of the Department of Labor and the Department of  Transportation, reached in May 1979, with respect to the protections to  be applied for such grants. The Special Warranty provides fair and  equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees and meets  the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). The Special Warranty Arrangement  applicable to OTRB and Other Than Urbanized grants will be derived from  the terms and conditions of the May 1979 Special Section 13(c) Warranty,  and the Department's subsequent experience under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). From  time to time, the Department may update this Special Warranty  Arrangement to reflect developments in the employee protection program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> for OTRB and ``Other Than  Urbanized'' grants are satisfied through application of a Special  Warranty Arrangement certified by the Department of Labor; a copy of the  current arrangement will be included on the OLMS Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Federal Transit Administration will include the current  version of the Special Warranty Arrangement, through reference in its  Master Agreement, in each OTRB and Other Than Urbanized grant of  assistance under the statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal Transit Administration will notify the Department  that it is funding an OTRB or Other Than Urbanized grant by transmitting  to the Department an information copy of each grant application upon  approval of the grant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each grant of assistance for an Other Than Urbanized program  will contain a labor section identifying labor organizations  representing transit employees of each subrecipient, the labor  organizations representing employees of other transit providers in the  service area, and a list of those transit providers. A sample format is  posted on the OLMS Web site to facilitate the inclusion of this  information in the grant application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> OTRB grants of assistance will contain a labor section  identifying labor organizations representing employees of the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department will notify labor organizations representing  potentially affected transit employees of the approval of Other Than  Urbanized and OTRB grants and inform them of their rights under the  Special Warranty Arrangement.
