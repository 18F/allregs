                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If an amount is deemed under section 666 to be an amount paid,  credited, or required to be distributed on the last day of a preceding  taxable year, the trust is not allowed a refund or credit of the amount  of ``taxes imposed on the trust'', as defined in Sec. 1.665(d)-1, which  would not have been payable for the preceding taxable year had the trust  in fact made such distribution on the last day of such year. However,  such taxes are allowed as a credit under section 668(b) against the tax  of the beneficiaries who are treated as having received the  distributions in the preceding taxable year. The amount of taxes which  may not be refunded or credited to the trust under this paragraph and  which are allowed as a credit under section 668(b) against the tax of  the beneficiaries, is an amount equal to the excess of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxes imposed on the trust (as defined in section 665(d) and  Sec. 1.655(d)-1) for any preceding taxable year (computed without  regard to the accumulation distribution for the taxable year) over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of taxes for such preceding taxable year which would  be imposed on the undistributed portion of distributable net income of  the trust for such preceding taxable year after the application of  subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1  of the Code, on account of the accumulation distribution determined for  the taxable year.  It should be noted that the credit under section 667 is computed by the  use of a different ratio from that used for computing the amount of  taxes deemed distributed under section 666(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1954, a trust of which A is the sole beneficiary has  taxable income of $20,000 (including capital gains of $5,100 allocable  to corpus less a personal exemption of $100), on which a tax of $7,260  is paid.  The undistributed portion of distributable net income is $15,000, to  which $6,160 of the tax is allocable under section 665. The  undistributed net income is therefore $8,840 ($15,000 minus $6,160). In  1955, the trust makes an accumulation distribution of $8,840. Under  section 666(b), the total taxes for 1954 attributable to the  undistributed net income are deemed distributed, so $15,000 is deemed  distributed. The amount of the tax which may not be refunded to the  trust under section 667 and the credit to which A is entitled under  section 668(b) is the excess of $6,160 over zero, since after the  distribution and the application of subpart D there is no remaining  undistributed portion of distributable net income for 1954.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The same trust as in example 1 of this paragraph  distributes $5,000 in 1955, rather than $8,840.

However, such taxes imposed on the trust are allowed as a  credit under section 667(b) against the tax of certain beneficiaries who  are treated as having received the distributions in the preceding  taxable year.  [T.D. 7204, 37 FR 17147, Aug. 25, 1972]    Sec. 1.667(b)-1A  Authorization of credit to beneficiary for taxes imposed on the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination of credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 667(b) allows  under certain   circumstances a credit (without interest) against the tax imposed by  subtitle A of the Code on the beneficiary for the taxable year in which  the accumulation distribution is required to be included in income under  section 668(a). In the case of an accumulation distribution consisting  only of undistributed net income, the amount of such credit is the total  of the taxes deemed distributed to such beneficiary under section 666  (b) and (c) as a result of such accumulation distribution for preceding  taxable years of the trust on the last day of which such beneficiary was  in being, less the amount of such taxes for such preceding taxable years  taken into account in reducing the amount of partial tax determined  under Sec. 1.668(b)-1A. In the case of an accumulation distribution  consisting only of undistributed capital gain, the amount of such credit  is the total of the taxes deemed distributed as a result of the  accumulation distribution to such beneficiary under section 669 (d) and  (e) for preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which  such beneficiary was in being, less the amount of such taxes for such  preceding taxable years taken into account in reducing the amount of  partial tax determined under Sec. 1.669(b)-1A. In the case of an  accumulation distribution consisting of both undistributed net income  and undistributed capital gain, a credit will not be available unless  the total taxes deemed distributed to the beneficiary for all preceding  taxable years as a result of the accumulation distribution exceeds the  beneficiary's partial tax determined under Sec. Sec. 1.668(b)-1A and  1.669(b)-1A without reference to the taxes deemed distributed. A credit  is not allowed for any taxes deemed distributed as a result of an  accumulation distribution to a beneficiary by reason of sections 666 (b)  and (c) or sections 669 (d) and (e) for a preceding taxable year of the  trust before the beneficiary was born or created. However, if as a  result of an accumulation distribution the total taxes deemed  distributed under sections 668(a)(2) and 668(a)(3) in preceding taxable  years before the beneficiary was born or created exceed the partial  taxes attributable to amounts deemed distributed in such years, such  excess may be used to offset any liability for partial taxes  attributable to amounts deemed distributed as a result of the same  accumulation distribution in preceding taxable years after the  beneficiary was born or created.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exact method. In the case of the tax computed under the exact  method provided in Sec. Sec. 1.668(b)-1A(b) and 1.669(b)-1A(b), the  credit allowed by this section is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compute the total taxes deemed distributed under Sec. Sec.  1.666(b)-1A and 1.666(c)-1A or Sec. Sec. 1.669(d)-1A and 1.669(e)-1A,  whichever are appropriate, for the preceding taxable years of the trust  on the last day of which the beneficiary was in being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph, the credit allowable is the  lesser of the amount of such excess or the amount of taxes deemed  distributed to the beneficiary for all preceding taxable years to the  extent that such taxes are not used in Sec. 1.668(b)-1A(b)(2) or Sec.  1.669(b)-1A(b)(2) in determining the beneficiary's partial tax under  section 668(a)(2) or 668(a)(3). The application of this subparagraph may  be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. An accumulation distribution made in 1975 is deemed  distribution in 1973 and 1974, years in which the beneficiary was in  being. The taxes deemed distributed in such years are $4,000 and $2,000,  respectively, totaling $6,000. The amounts of tax computed under Sec.  1.668(b)-1A(b)(1) attributable to the amounts thrown back are $3,000 and  $2,000, respectively, totaling $5,000. The credit allowable under this  subparagraph is therefore $1,000 ($6,000 less $5,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Short-cut method. In the case of the tax computed under the  short-cut method provided in Sec. 1.668(b)-1A(c) or   Sec. 1.669(b)-1A(c), the credit allowed by this section is computed as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compute the total taxes deemed distributed in all preceding  taxable years of the trust under Sec. Sec. 1.666(b)-1A and 1.666(c)-1A  or Sec.

Sec.  1.666(b)-1A and 1.666(c)-1A or Sec. Sec. 1.669(d)-1A and 1.669(e)-1A,  which are appropriate, for the preceding taxable years of the trust on  the last day of which the beneficiary was in being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Multiply the amount by which subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph exceeds subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph by a  fraction, the numerator of which is the amount determined under  subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph and the denominator of which is  the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. The  result is the allowable credit. The application of this subparagraph may  be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. An accumulation distribution that consists only of  undistributed net income is made in 1975. The taxes deemed distributed  in the preceding years under Sec. Sec. 1.666(b)-1A and 1.666(c)-1A are  $15,000. The amount determined under Sec. 1.668(b)-1A(c)(1)(v) is  $12,000. The beneficiary was in being on the last day of all but one  preceding taxable year in which the accumulation distribution was deemed  made, and the taxes deemed distributed in those years was $10,000.  Therefore, the excess of the subdivision (i) amount over the subdivision  (ii) amount is $3,000, and is multiplied by 10,000/15,000, resulting in  an answer of $2,000, which is the credit allowable when computed under  the short-cut method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>  and the regulations thereunder.  [T.D. 7204, 37 FR 17147, Aug. 25, 1972]    Sec. 1.668(a)-1A  Amounts treated as received in prior taxable years; inclusion in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em> on the last day of such preceding taxable  year. The total is included in the income of the beneficiary for the  taxable year of the beneficiary in which such amounts are in fact paid,  credited, or required to be distributed unless the taxable year of the  beneficiary differs from the taxable year of the trust (see section  662(c) and the regulations thereunder). The character of the amounts  treated as received by a beneficiary in prior taxable years, including  taxes deemed distributed, in the hands of the beneficiary is determined  by the rules set forth in section 662(b) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any deduction allowed to the trust in computing distributable  net income for a preceding taxable year (such as depreciation,  depletion, etc.) is not deemed allocable to a beneficiary because of  amounts included in a beneficiary's gross income under this section  since the deduction has already been utilized in reducing the amount  included in the beneficiary's income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of applying section 668(a)(3), a trust shall be  considered to be other than a ``trust which is not required to  distribute all of its income currently'' for each taxable year prior to  the first taxable year beginning   after December 31, 1968, and ending after November 30, 1969, in which  income is accumulated. Income will not be deemed to have been  accumulated for purposes of applying section 668(a)(3) in a year if the  trustee makes a determination, as evidenced by a statement on the  return, to distribute all of the trust's income for such year and also  makes a good faith determination as to the amount of such income and  actually distributed for such year the entire amount so determined. The  term ``income,'' as used in the preceding two sentences, is defined in  Sec. Sec. 1.643(b)-1 and 1.643(b)-2. Since, under such definitions,  certain items may be included in distributable net income but are not,  under applicable local law, ``income'' (as, for example, certain  extraordinary dividends), a trust that has undistributed net income from  such sources might still qualify as a trust that has not accumulated  income. Also, for example, if a trust establishes a reserve for  depreciation or depletion and applicable local law permits the deduction  for such reserve in the computation of ``income,'' amounts so added to  the reserve do not constitute an accumulation of income. If a trust has  separate shares, and any share accumulates income, all shares of the  trust will be considered to have accumulated income for purposes of  section 668(a)(3). Amounts retained by a trust or a portion of a trust  that is subject to subpart E (sections 671-678) shall not be considered  accumulated income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> See section 1302(a)(2)(B) to the effect that amounts included in  the income of a beneficiary of a trust under section 668(a) are not  eligible for income averaging.

This section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Under the terms of a trust instrument, the trustee may  accumulate the income or make distributions to A and B. The trustee may  also invade corpus for the benefit of A and B. The distributable net  income of the trust for taxable year 1975 is $10,000. The trust had  undistributed net income for taxable year 1973, the first year of the  trust, of $5,000, to which a tax of $1,100 was allocable. On May 1,  1975, the trustee distributes $10,000 to A, and on November 29, 1975, he  distributes $5,000 to B. Thus, of the total distribution of $15,000, A  received two-thirds and B receives one-third.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the purposes of determining the amounts includible in the  beneficiaries' gross income for 1975, the trust is deemed to have made  the following distributions:  Amount distributed out of 1975 income (distributable net         $10,000</p><p class="depth0">income).....................................................

For purposes of this paragraph, the  method used in the return shall be accepted as the method that produces  the lesser tax.

For purposes of this paragraph,  the ``section 666 amounts'' for a preceding taxable year are the amounts  deemed distributed under section 666(a) on the last day of the preceding  taxable year, plus the amount of taxes deemed distributed on such day  under section 666 (b) or (c). The tax attributable to such amounts in  each prior taxable year of the beneficiary is the difference between the  tax for such year computed with the inclusion of the section 666 amounts  in the beneficiary's gross income and the tax for such year computed  without including them in such gross income. Tax computations for each  such year shall reflect a taxpayer's marital, dependency, exemption, and  filing status for such year. To the extent the undistributed net income  of a trust deemed distributed in an accumulation distribution includes  amounts received as an accumulation distribution from another trust, for  purposes of this paragraph they shall be considered as amounts deemed  distributed by the trust under section 666(a) on the last day of each of  the preceding taxable years in which such amounts were accumulated by  such other trust. For example, assume trust Z, a calendar year trust,  received in its taxable year 1975 an accumulation distribution from  trust Y, a calendar year trust, that included undistributed net income  and taxes of trust Y for the taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974. To the  extent an accumulation distribution made by trust Z in its taxable year  1976 includes such undistributed net income and taxes, it shall be  considered an accumulation distribution by trust Z in the taxable year  1976 and under section 666(a) will be deemed distributed on the last day  of the preceding taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> From the sum of the taxes for the prior taxable years  attributable to the section 666 amounts (computed in accordance with  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), subtract so much of the amount of  taxes deemed distributed to the beneficiary under Sec.

For example, assume trust Z, a calendar year  trust, received in its taxable year 1975 an accumulation distribution  from trust Y, a calendar year trust, that included undistributed net  income of trust Y for the taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974. To the  extent an accumulation distribution made by trust Z in its taxable year  1976 includes such undistributed net income, it shall be considered an  accumulation distribution by trust Z in the taxable year 1976 and under  section 666(a) will be deemed distributed on the last day of the  preceding taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974. For purposes of this  subparagraph, such number of preceding taxable years of the trust shall  not include any preceding taxable year of the trust in which the  undistributed net income deemed distributed is less than 25 percent of  (a) the total amounts deemed under section 666(a) to be undistributed  net income from preceding taxable years divided by (b) the number of  such preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an  amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed without  application of this sentence. For example, assume that an accumulation  distribution of $90,000 made to a beneficiary in 1979 is deemed  distributed in the amounts of $29,000 in each of the years 1972, 1973,  and 1974, and $3,000 in 1975. The number of preceding taxable years on  the last day of which an amount was deemed distributed without reference  to the second sentence of this subparagraph is four. However, the  distribution deemed made in 1975 ($3,000) is less than $5,625, which is  25 percent of (a) the total undistributed net income deemed distributed  under section 666(a) ($90,000) divided by (b) the number of such  preceding taxable years (4), or $22,500. Therefore, for purposes of this  subparagraph the accumulation distribution is deemed distributed in only  3 preceding taxable years (1972, 1973, and 1974).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second, divide the amount (representing the accumulation  distribution and taxes deemed distributed) required under section 668(a)  to be included in the income of the beneficiary for the taxable year by  the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of  which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed  (determined as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph). The  amount determined under this subdivision, including taxes deemed  distributed, consists of the same proportion of each class of income as  the total of each class of income deemed distributed in the accumulation  distribution bears to the total undistributed net income from such  preceding taxable years deemed   distributed in the accumulation distribution. For example, assume that  an amount of $50,000 is deemed distributed under section 666(a) from  undistributed net income of 5 preceding taxable years of the trust, and  consists of $25,000 of interest, $15,000 of dividends, and $10,000 of  net rental income. Taxes attributable to such amounts in the amount of  $10,000 are also deemed distributed. The amount determined under this  subdivision, $12,000 ($50,000 income plus $10,000 tax divided by 5  years), is deemed to consist of $6,000 in interest, $3,600 in dividends,  and $2,400 in net rental income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Third, compute the tax of the beneficiary for each of the 3  taxable years immediately preceding the year in which the accumulation  distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> With the inclusion in gross income of the beneficiary for each  of such 3 years of the amount determined under subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this  subdivision for that year is the additional tax resulting from the  inclusion in gross income for that year of the amount determined under  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For example, assume that a  distribution of $12,000, is includible in the income of each of the  beneficiary's 3 preceding taxable years when his income (without the  inclusion of the accumulation distribution) was $20,000, $30,000, and  $40,000. The inclusion of $12,000 in income would produce taxable income  of $32,000, $42,000, and $52,000, and the tax attributable to such  increases would be $4,000, $5,000, and $6,000, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fourth, add the additional taxes resulting from the application  of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph and then divide this amount by  3. For example, if these additional taxes are $4,000, $5,000, and $6,000  for the 3 preceding taxable years, this amount would be $5,000  ($4,000+$5,000+ $6,000 divided by 3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fifth, the resulting amount is then multiplied by the number of  preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an amount  is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed (previously  determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph). For example, if  an amount is deemed distributed for 5 preceding taxable years, the  resulting amount would be five times the $5,000 amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Sixth, the resulting amount, less so much of the amount of  taxes deemed distributed to the beneficiary under Sec. Sec. 1.666(b)-1A  and 1.666(c)-1A as does not exceed such resulting amount, is the tax  under the short-cut method provided in section 668(b)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The computation of the tax by the short-cut method may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1971, X creates a trust which is to accumulate its  income and pay the income to Y when Y reaches 30. Y is 19. Over the 11  years of the trust, the trust earns $1,200 of interest income annually  and has expenses each year of $100 allocable to the production of  income. The trust pays a total tax of $1,450 on the accumulated income.  In 1981, when Y reaches 30, the $9,550 of accumulated undistributed net  income and the $1,100 of current net income are distributed to Y. Y is  treated as having received a total distribution of $11,000 (the $9,550  accumulation distribution plus the taxes paid by the trust which are  deemed to have been distributed to Y). The income of the current year  (1981) is taxed directly to Y. The computation is as follows: $11,000  (accumulation distribution plus taxes) divided by 10 (number of years  out of which distribution was made) equals $1,100. The $1,100 added to  the income of the beneficiary's preceding 3 years produces increases in  tax as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1980................................................       $350</p><p class="depth0">1979................................................        300</p><p class="depth0">1978................................................        250</p><p class="depth0">-----------------</p><p class="depth0">Total.............................................        900</p><p class="depth0">$900 (total additional tax) divided by 3 equals $300 (average annual  increase in tax). $300 (average annual increase in tax) times 10 equals  $3,000, from which is deducted the amount of taxes ($1,450) paid by the  trust attributable to the undistributed net income deemed distributed.  The amount of tax to be paid currently under the short-cut method is  therefore $1,550.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disallowance of short-cut method. If, in any prior taxable year  of the beneficiary in which any part of the accumulation distribution of  undistributed net income is deemed to have been distributed under  section 666(a) to such   beneficiary, any part of prior accumulation distributions of  undistributed net income by each of two or more other trusts is deemed  under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary, then  the short-cut method under paragraph (c) of this section may not be used  and the partial tax imposed by section 668(a)(2) shall be computed only  under the exact method under paragraph (b) of this section. For example,  assume that, in 1978, trust X makes an accumulation distribution of  undistributed net income to A, who is on the calendar year basis, and  part of the accumulation distribution is deemed under section 666(a) to  have been distributed on March 31, 1974. In 1977, A had received an  accumulation distribution of undistributed net income from both trust Y  and trust Z. Part of the accumulation distribution from trust Y was  deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to A on June 30,  1974, and part of the accumulation distribution from trust Z was deemed  under section 666(a) to have been distributed to A on December 31, 1974.  Because there were portions of accumulation distributions of  undistributed net income from two other trusts deemed distributed within  the same prior taxable year of A (1974), the 1978 accumulation  distribution from trust X may not be computed under the short-cut method  provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore the exact method  under paragraph (b) of this section must be used to compute the tax  imposed by section 666(a)(2).

A was born on October 9, 1975. It will  be assumed for purposes of Sec. 1.668(b)-1A that A was alive in 1973,  was on the calendar year basis, had no income other than (i) the $10,000  from the earlier accumulation distribution deemed distributed in 1973,  and (ii) the part of the 1980 distribution deemed distributed in 1973,  and had no deductions other than the personal exemption provided in  section 151. It should be noted that the standard deduction for 1973  will be available to A with respect to the distribution only to the  extent it qualifies as ``earned income'' in the hands of the trust. See  section 141(e) and the regulations thereunder and Sec. 1.652(b)-1. If A  were a trust or estate created after 1973, the same assumptions would  apply, except that the trust or estate would not be entitled to the  standard deduction and would receive the personal exemption provided  under section 642(b) in the same manner as allowed under such section  for A's first actual taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-1A.

The beneficiary shall indicate the  order he has determined to deem the accumulation distributions to have  been received by him on his return for the taxable year. A failure by  him so to indicate, however, shall not affect his right to make such  determination. The purpose of this rule is to assure that the tax  resulting from the later (as so deemed under this paragraph)  distribution is computed with the inclusion of the earlier distribution  in the taxable base and that the tax resulting from the earlier (as so  deemed under this paragraph) distribution is computed with the later  distribution excluded from the taxable base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples.

Also in 1980, trust Y makes an accumulation distribution of  undistributed net income to A, of which $5,000 is deemed under section  666 to have been distributed in 1974. A determines to treat the 1980  distribution from trust Y as having been made prior to the 1980  distribution from trust X.

A capital gain distribution is  allocated to the preceding taxable years of the trust (as defined in  Sec. 1.665(e)-1A(a)(1)(iii)), according to the undistributed capital  gain of the trust for such years. For this purpose, a capital gain  distribution is first allocated to the earliest such preceding taxable  year in which there is undistributed capital gain and shall then be  allocated in turn, beginning with the next earliest, to any remaining  preceding taxable years of the trust. The portion of the capital gain  distribution allocated to the earliest preceding taxable year is the  amount of undistributed capital gain for that preceding taxable year.  The portion of the capital gain distribution allocated to any preceding  taxable year subsequent to the earliest such preceding taxable year is  the excess of the capital gain distribution over the aggregate of the  undistributed capital gain for all earlier preceding taxable years. See  paragraph (c) of this section for adjustments to undistributed capital  gain for prior distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of undistributed capital gain for prior capital gain  distributions. For the purposes of allocating to any preceding taxable  year a capital gain distribution of the taxable year, the undistributed  capital gain of such preceding taxable year is reduced by the amount  from such year deemed distributed in any capital gain distribution made  in any taxable year intervening between such preceding taxable year and  the taxable year. Accordingly, for example, if a trust subject to the  capital gain throwback has no undistributed net income but has  undistributed capital gain for 1974, and makes capital gain  distributions during the taxable years 1978 and 1979, then in  determining that part of the 1979 capital gain distribution that is  thrown back to 1974, the undistributed capital gain for 1974 is reduced  by the amount of such undistributed capital gain for 1974 deemed  distributed in the 1978 capital gain distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rule when no undistributed capital gain. If, before the  application of the provisions of subpart D to a capital gain  distribution for the taxable year, there is no undistributed capital  gain for a preceding taxable year, then no portion of the capital gain  distribution is deemed distributed on the last day of such preceding  taxable year. Thus, for example, if a capital gain distribution is made  during the taxable year 1975 from a trust whose earliest preceding  taxable year is taxable year 1970, and the trust had no undistributed  capital gain for 1970, then no portion of the 1975 capital gain  distribution is deemed distributed on the last day of 1970.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1977, a trust reporting on the calendar year basis makes  a capital gain distribution of $33,000. In 1969, the trust had $6,000 of  undistributed capital gain; in 1970, $4,000; in 1971, none; in 1972,  $7,000; in 1973, $5,000; in 1974, $8,000; in 1975, $6,000; in 1976,  $4,000; and $6,000 in 1977.

The partial tax  referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, compute the tax attributable to the section 669 amounts  for each of the preceding taxable years. For purposes of this paragraph,  the ``section 669 amounts'' for a preceding taxable year are the amounts  deemed distributed under section 669(a) on the last day of such  preceding taxable year, plus the amount of taxes deemed distributed on  such day under section 669 (d) or (e). The tax attributable to such  amounts in each prior taxable year of the beneficiary is the difference  between the tax for such year computed with the inclusion of the section  669 amounts in the beneficiary's gross income and the tax for such year  computed with the inclusion of them in such gross income. Tax  computations for each such year shall reflect a taxpayer's marital,  dependency, exemption, and filing status for such year. To the extent  the undistributed capital gain of a trust deemed distributed in a  capital gain distribution includes amounts received as a capital gain  distribution from another trust, for purposes of this paragraph they  shall be considered as amounts deemed distributed by the trust under  section 669(a) on the last day of each of the preceding taxable years in  which such amounts were accumulated by such other trust.   For example, assume trust Z, a calendar year trust received in its  taxable year 1975 a capital gain distribution from trust Y, a calendar  year trust, that included undistributed capital gain of trust Y for the  taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974. To the extent a capital gain  distribution made by trust Z in its taxable year 1976 includes such  undistributed capital gain, it shall be considered a capital gain  distribution by trust Z in the taxable year 1976 and under section  669(a) will be deemed distributed on the last day of the preceding  taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> From the sum of the taxes for the prior taxable years  attributable to the section 669(a) amounts (computed in accordance with  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), subtract so much of the amount of  taxes deemed distributed to the beneficiary under Sec.

The resulting amount, if  any, is the partial tax on the beneficiary, computed under the exact  method, for the taxable year in which the capital gain distribution is  paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of tax by the short-cut method. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tax referred  to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First, determine the number of preceding taxable years of the  trust on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 669(a)  to have been distributed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  preceding taxable years of a trust that has received a capital gain  distribution from another trust shall include the taxable years of such  other trust in which an amount was deemed distributed in such capital  gain distribution. For example, assume trust Z, a calendar year trust,  received in its taxable year 1975 a capital gain distribution from trust  Y, a calendar year trust, that included undistributed capital gain of  trust Y for the taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974. To the extent a  capital gain distribution made by trust Z in its taxable year 1976  includes such undistributed capital gain, it shall be considered a  capital gain distribution by trust Z in the taxable year 1976 and under  section 669(a) will be deemed distributed on the last day of the  preceding taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974. For purposes of this  subparagraph, such number of preceding taxable years of the trust shall  not include any preceding taxable year of the trust in which the  undistributed capital gain deemed distributed is less than 25 percent of  (a) the total amounts deemed under section 669(a) to be undistributed  capital gain from preceding taxable years, divided by (b) the number of  such preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an  amount is deemed under section 669(a) to have been distributed without  application of this sentence. For example, assume that a capital gain  distribution of $90,000 made to a beneficiary in 1979 is deemed  distributed in the amounts of $29,000 in each of the years 1972, 1973,  and 1974, and $3,000 in 1975. The number of preceding taxable years on  the last day of which an amount was deemed distributed without reference  to the second sentence of this subparagraph is 4. However, the  distribution deemed made in 1975 ($3,000) is less than $5,625, which is  25 percent of (a) the total undistributed capital gain deemed  distributed under section 669(a) ($90,000) divided by (b) the number of  such preceding taxable years (4), or $22,500. Therefore, for purposes of  this subparagraph, the capital gain distribution is deemed distributed  in only 3 preceding taxable years (1972, 1973, and 1974).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second, divide the amount (representing the capital gain  distribution and taxes deemed distributed) required under section 668(a)  to be included in the income of the beneficiary for the taxable year by  the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of  which an amount is deemed under section 669(a) to have been distributed  (determined as provided in subdivision (i) of this paragraph). The  amount determined under this subdivision, including taxes deemed  distributed, consists of the same proportion of long-term and short-term  capital gain as the total of each type of capital gain deemed  distributed in the capital gain distribution bears to the total  undistributed capital gain from such preceding taxable years deemed  distributed in the capital gain distribution. For example, assume that  an amount   of $50,000 is deemed distributed under section 669(a) from undistributed  capital gain of 5 preceding taxable years of the trust, and consists of  $30,000 of long-term capital gain and $20,000 of short-term capital  gain. Taxes attributable to such amounts in the amount of $10,000 are  also deemed distributed. The amount determined under this subdivision,  $12,000 ($50,000 income plus $10,000 tax, divided by 5 years), is deemed  to consist of $7,200 of long-term capital gain and $4,800 in short-term  capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Third, compute the tax of the beneficiary for each of the 3  taxable years immediately preceding the year in which the capital gain  distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> With the inclusion in gross income of the beneficiary for each  of such 3 years of the amount determined under subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this  subdivision for that year is the additional tax resulting from the  inclusion in gross income for that year of the amount determined under  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fourth, add the additional taxes resulting from the application  of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph and then divide this amount by  3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fifth, the resulting amount is then multiplied by the number of  preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an amount  is deemed under section 669(a) to have been distributed (previously  determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The resulting amount, less so much of the amount of taxes  deemed distributed to the beneficiary under Sec.

If, in any prior taxable year  of the beneficiary in which any part of the capital gain distribution is  deemed to have been distributed under section 669(a) to such  beneficiary, any part of prior capital gain distributions by each of two  or more other trusts is deemed under section 669(a) to have been  distributed to such beneficiary, then the short-cut method under  paragraph (c) of this section may not be used and the partial tax  imposed by section 668(a)(3) shall be computed only under the exact  method under paragraph (b) of this section. For example, assume that, in  1978, trust X makes a capital gain distribution to A, who is on the  calendar year basis, and part of the distribution is deemed under  section 669(a) to have been distributed on March 31, 1974. In 1977, A  had received a capital gain distribution from both trust Y and trust Z.  Part of the capital gain distribution from trust Y was deemed under  section 669(a) to have been distributed to A on June 30, 1974, and part  of the capital gain distribution from trust Z was deemed under section  669(a) to have been distributed to A on December 31, 1974. Because there  were portions of capital gain distributions from two other trusts deemed  distributed within the same prior taxable year of A (1974), the 1978  capital gain distribution from trust X may not be computed under the  short-cut method provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore  the exact method under paragraph (b) of this section must be used to  compute the tax imposed by section 668(a)(3).

The income of the beneficiary,  for any of his prior taxable years for which a tax is being recomputed  under Sec. 1.669(b)-1A, shall include any amounts of prior accumulation  distributions (including prior capital gain distributions) deemed  distributed under sections 666 and 669 in such prior taxable year. For  purposes of the preceding sentence, a prior accumulation distribution is  a distribution from the same or another trust which was paid, credited,  or required to be distributed in a prior taxable year of the  beneficiary. The term prior accumulation distribution also includes  accumulation distributions of   the same or other trusts which were distributed to the beneficiary in  the same taxable year. The term ``prior capital gain distribution'' also  includes capital gain distributions of other trusts which were paid,  credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiary in the same  taxable year and which the beneficiary has determined under paragraph  (b) of this section to treat as having been distributed before the  capital gain distribution for which tax is being computed under Sec.  1.669(b)-1A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multiple distributions in the same taxable year. For purposes of  paragraph (a) of this section, capital gain distributions made from more  than one trust in the same taxable year of the beneficiary, regardless  of when in the taxable year they were actually made, shall be treated as  having been made consecutively, in whichever order the beneficiary may  determine. However, the beneficiary must treat them as having been made  in the same order for the purpose of computing the partial tax on the  several capital gain distributions. The beneficiary shall indicate the  order he has determined to deem the capital gain distributions to have  been received by him on his return for the taxable year. A failure by  him so to indicate, however, shall not affect his right to make such  determination. The purpose of this rule is to assure that the tax  resulting from the later (as so deemed under this paragraph)  distribution is computed with the inclusion of the earlier distribution  in the taxable base and that the tax resulting from the earlier (as so  deemed under this paragraph) distribution is computed with the later  distribution excluded from the taxable base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> of Sec. 1.669(b)-1A,  that the beneficiary:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Was in existence on such last day,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Was a calendar year taxpayer,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Had no gross income other than the amounts deemed distributed to  him from such trust in his calendar year in which such last day occurred  and from all other trusts from which amounts are deemed to have been  distributed to him in such calendar year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If an individual, was unmarried and had no dependents,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Had no deductions other than the standard deduction, if  applicable, under section 141 for such calendar year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Was entitled to the personal exemption under section 151 or  642(b).

A was born on October 9, 1975.

[T.D. 6989, 34 FR 739, Jan. 17, 1969]    Sec. 1.669(a)-4  Tax attributable to short-cut throwback method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(B)</em>, the tax liability of the beneficiary for the taxable year  is computed in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, determine the number of preceding taxable years of the  trust, on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a)  to have been distributed. In any case where there has been a prior  accumulation distribution with respect to which the beneficiary has  elected to compute his tax either by the exact throwback method or by  the short-cut throwback method, or to which the next to the last  sentence of section 668(a) has applied, for purposes of an election to  use the short-cut throwback method with respect to a subsequent  accumulation distribution, in determining the number of preceding  taxable years of the trust with respect to which an amount of the  subsequent accumulation distribution is deemed distributed to a   beneficiary under section 666(a), there shall be excluded any preceding  taxable year during which any part of the prior accumulation  distribution was deemed distributed to the beneficiary. For example,  assume that an accumulation distribution of $90,000 made to a  beneficiary in 1963 is deemed distributed in the amounts of $25,000 in  each of the years 1962, 1961, and 1960, and in the amount of $15,000 in  1959, and a subsequent accumulation distribution of $85,000 made to the  same beneficiary in 1964 is deemed distributed in the amount of $10,000  during 1959, and $25,000 during each of the years 1958, 1957, and 1956.  The accumulation distribution made in 1963 is deemed distributed in 4  preceding taxable years of the trust (1962, 1961, 1960, and 1959).  Inasmuch as the year 1959 was a year during which part of the 1963  accumulation distribution was deemed distributed, for purposes of  determining the number of preceding taxable years in which the  accumulation distribution of $85,000 made in 1964 is deemed distributed,  the year 1959 is excluded and the $85,000 accumulation distribution is  deemed distributed in three preceding taxable years (1958, 1957, and  1956),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Second, divide the number of preceding taxable years of the  trust, on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a)  to have been distributed (determined as provided in subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph) into the amount (representing an accumulation  distribution made by a foreign trust created by a U.S. person) required  to be included under section 669(a) in the gross income of the  beneficiary for the taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Third, compute the tax of the beneficiary for the current  taxable year (the year in which the accumulation distribution is paid,  credited, or required to be distributed to him) and for each of the 2  taxable years immediately preceding such year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the inclusion in gross income of the beneficiary for each  of such 3 years of the amount determined under subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this subparagraph for that year is the additional  tax resulting from the inclusion in gross income for that year of the  amount determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If the  number of preceding taxable years of the trust, on the last day of which  an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed, is  less than three, the taxable years of the beneficiary for which this  recomputation is made shall equal the number of years in which an amount  is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed, commencing with  the taxable year of the beneficiary in which the accumulation  distribution is paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him. If  the beneficiary was not alive during one of the two taxable years  immediately preceding the taxable year, the tax resulting from the  inclusion of the amount determined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph  in the gross income of the beneficiary will be computed only for the  taxable year in which the accumulation distribution was paid, credited,  or required to be distributed to him and the preceding year during which  the beneficiary was alive. In the event the beneficiary was not alive  during either of the 2 years immediately preceding the taxable year in  which the accumulation distribution was paid, credited, or required to  be distributed, the tax shall be computed on the basis of the  beneficiary's taxable year without regard to the inclusion in income  required by section 668(a) of any amount other than pursuant to section  669(a)(1)(B). For example, assume that a foreign trust created by a U.S.  person accumulates $3,000 of income in 1964 and $7,000 in 1963 and then  distributes the accumulated income on January 1, 1965, to a beneficiary  who is a U.S. person. The limitation on tax is determined by recomputing  the beneficiary's gross income for 1964 and 1965 by adding $5,000 to his  gross income for each year. If the same distribution were made to an  infant who was born in 1965, the limitation on tax would be computed by  adding $5,000 to his gross income for such year. In the case of the  infant, the resulting increase in tax would be multiplied by two to  arrive at the limitation   on the increase in his tax for 1965 attributable to such distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fourth, add the additional taxes resulting from the application  of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for the taxable year and the 2  taxable years (or the 1 taxable year, where applicable) immediately  preceding the year in which the accumulation distribution is paid,  credited, or required to be distributed and then divide this amount by  three (or two, where applicable). The resulting amount is then  multiplied by the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the  last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been  distributed (previously determined under subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph). The resulting amount is the tax, under the short-cut  throwback method provided in section 669(a)(1)(B), which is attributable  to the amounts treated under section 668(a) as having been received by  the beneficiary from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person on the  last day of the preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fifth, add the amount determined under subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph to the beneficiary's tax for the taxable year in which the  accumulation distribution was paid, credited, or required to be  distributed to him, computed without inclusion of the accumulation  distribution in gross income for that year. The total is the  beneficiary's income tax for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-1  Information requirements.</p><p class="depth0">The election of a beneficiary who is a U.S. person to apply the  limitations on tax provided in section 669(a) shall not be effective  unless the beneficiary, at or before the time the election is made,  supplies, in a letter addressed to the district director for the  internal revenue district in which the taxpayer files his return (or the  Director of International Operations where appropriate), or in a  statement attached to his return, the following information with respect  to the operation and accounts of the foreign trust created by a U.S.  person for each of the preceding taxable years, on the last day of which  an amount is deemed distributed under section 666(a):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The gross income of the trust: The gross income should be  separated to show the amount of each type of income received by the  trust and to identify its source.

Accordingly, subpart D provides special rules for the treatment of  amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed by a complex trust  (one that is subject to subpart C (section 661 and following) of such  part I) in any year in excess of ``distributable net income'' (as  defined in section 643 (a)) for that year. Such an excess distribution  is an ``accumulation distribution'' (as defined in section 665(b)). The  special rules of subpart D are generally inapplicable to amounts paid,  credited, or required to be distributed by a trust in a taxable year in  which it qualifies as a simple trust (one that is subject to subpart B  (section 651 and following) of such part I). However, see Sec.  1.665(e)-1A(b) for rules relating to the treatment of a simple trust as  a complex trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An accumulation distribution is deemed to consist of, first,  ``undistributed net income'' (as defined in section 665(a)) of the trust  from preceding taxable years, and, after all the undistributed net  income for all preceding taxable years has been deemed distributed,  ``undistributed capital gain'' (as defined in section 665(f)) of the  trust for all preceding taxable years commencing with the first year  such amounts were accumulated. An accumulation distribution of  undistributed capital gain is a ``capital gain distribution'' (as  defined in section 665(g)). To the extent an accumulation distribution  exceeds the ``undistributed net income'' and ``undistributed capital  gain'' so determined, it is deemed to consist of corpus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The accumulation distribution is ``thrown back'' to the earliest  ``preceding taxable year'' of the trust, which, in the case of  distributions made for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973,  from a trust (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person), is  any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1968. Special transitional  rules apply for distributions made in taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1974. In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S.  person, a ``preceding taxable year'' is any year of the trust to which  the Code applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A distribution of undistributed net income (included in an  accumulation distribution) and a capital gain distribution will be  included in the income of the beneficiary in the year they are actually  paid, credited, or required to be distributed to him. The   tax on the distribution will be approximately the amount of tax the  beneficiary would have paid with respect to the distribution had the  income and capital gain been distributed to the beneficiary in the year  earned by the trust. An additional amount equal to the ``taxes imposed  on the trust'' for the preceding year is also deemed distributed. To  prevent double taxation, however, the beneficiary receives a credit for  such taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)-1)</em> are applicable only to taxable years beginning before  January 1, 1969, and all references therein to sections 665 through 669  are references to such sections before amendment by the Tax Reform Act  of 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples.

The  application of the rule in this paragraph to a taxable year of a trust  in which income is accumulated may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Under the terms of the trust, $10,000 of income is required  to be distributed currently to A and the trustee has discretion to make  additional distributions to A. During the taxable year 1971 the trust  had distributable net income of $30,100 derived from royalties and the  trustee made distributions of $20,000 to A. The taxable income of the  trust is $10,000 on which a tax of $2,190 is paid. The undistributed net  income of the trust for the taxable year 1971 is $7,910, computed as  follows:  Distributable net income..........................    $30,100 Less:</p><p class="depth0">Income currently distributable to A.............    $10,000</p><p class="depth0">Other amounts distributed to A..................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">Taxes imposed on the trust attributable to the        2,190</p><p class="depth0">undistributed net income (see Sec. 1.665(d)-</p><p class="depth0">1A)............................................</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Total.........................................     22,190</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Undistributed net income......................      7,910</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> thereof), less:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of income required to be distributed currently and  any other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be  distributed to beneficiaries in the taxable year as specified in section  661(a), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this paragraph, the amount of taxes  imposed on the trust for any taxable year by chapter 1 of the Internal  Revenue Code is the amount of taxes imposed pursuant to section 871  (relating to tax on non-resident alien individuals) which is properly  allocable to the undistributed portion of the distributable net income.  See Sec. 1.665(d)-1A. The amount of taxes imposed pursuant to section  871 is the difference between the total tax imposed pursuant to that  section on the foreign trust created by a U.S. person for the year and  the   amount which would have been imposed on such trust had all the  distributable net income, as determined under section 643(a), been  distributed. The application of the rule in this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A trust was created in 1952 under the laws of Country X  by the transfer to a trustee in Country X of property by a U.S. person.  The entire trust constitutes a foreign trust created by a U.S. person.  The governing instrument of the trust provides that $7,000 of income is  required to be distributed currently to a U.S. beneficiary and gives the  trustee discretion to make additional distributions to the beneficiary.  During the taxable year 1973 the trust had income of $10,000 from  dividends of a U.S. corporation (on which Federal income taxes of $3,000  were imposed pursuant to section 871 and withheld under section 1441,  resulting in the receipt by the trust of cash in the amount of $7,000),  $20,000 in capital gains from the sale of stock of a Country Y  corporation and $30,000 from dividends of a Country X corporation, none  of the gross income of which was derived from sources within the United  States. No income taxes were required to be paid to Country X or Country  Y in 1973. The trustee did not file a U.S. income tax return for the  taxable year 1973. The distributable net income of the trust before  distributions to the beneficiary for 1973 is $60,000 ($57,000 of which  is cash). During 1973 the trustee made distributions to the U.S.  beneficiary equaling one-half of the trust's distributable net income.  Thus, the U.S. beneficiary is treated as having had distributed to him  $5,000 (composed of $3,500 as a cash distribution and $1,500 as the tax  imposed pursuant to section 871 and withheld under section 1441),  representing one-half of the income from U.S. sources; $10,000 in cash,  representing one-half of the capital gains from the sale of stock of the  Country Y corporation; and $15,000 in cash, representing one-half of the  income from Country X sources for a total of $30,000.

For example, if a nonresident alien  receives a distribution from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person  and then pays the amount of the distribution over to a U.S. person, the  payment of such amount to the U.S. person represents an accumulation  distribution to the U.S. person from the trust to the extent that the  amount received would have been an accumulation distribution had the  trust paid the amount directly to the U.S. person in the year in which  the payment was received by the U.S. person. This section also applies  in a case where a nonresident alien receives indirectly an accumulation  distribution from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and then pays  it over to a U.S. person.

The amount of taxes imposed on  the trust attributable to undistributed capital gain is $1,468, computed  as follows:  $3,787 (total taxes) x $5,000 (capital gains not included in      $1,468</p><p class="depth0">d.n.i. less section 1202 deductions) divided by $12,900</p><p class="depth0">(taxable income)............................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimum tax. The term taxes imposed on the trust attributable to  the undistributed capital gain also includes the minimum tax for tax  preferences imposed on the trust by section 56 with respect to the  undistributed capital gain. The amount of such minimum tax so included  bears the same relation to the total amount of minimum tax imposed on  the trust by section 56 for the taxable year as one-half the net capital  gain (net section 1201 gain for taxable years beginning before January  1, 1977) (as defined in section 1222(11)) from such taxable year bears  to the sum of the items of tax preference of the trust for such taxable  year which are apportioned to the trust in accordance with Sec. 1.58- 3(a) (1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduction for prior distribution. If in any taxable year a  capital gain distribution is made by the trust which results in a  throwback to a prior year, the taxes of the prior year imposed on the  trust attributable to any remaining undistributed capital gain of the  prior year are the taxes prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph reduced by the taxes of the prior year deemed distributed  under section 669 (d) or (e). The provisions of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume the same facts as in the example in subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph. In 1976, the trust makes a capital gain distribution,  of which an amount of undistributed capital gain is deemed distributed  in 1974. Taxes imposed on the trust (in the amount of $500) attributable  to the undistributed capital gain are therefore deemed distributed in  such year. Consequently, the taxes imposed on the trust attributable to  the remaining undistributed capital gain are $968 ($1,468 less $500).  [T.D. 7204, 37 FR 17139, Aug. 25, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR  72650, Nov. 3, 1980]    Sec. 1.665(e)-1A  Preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Domestic trusts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of  subpart D, in the case of a trust other than a foreign trust created by  a U.S. person, the term preceding taxable year serves to identify and  limit the taxable years of a trust to which an accumulation distribution  consisting of undistributed net income or undistributed capital gain may  be allocated (or ``thrown back'') under section 666(a) and 669(a). An  accumulation distribution consisting of undistributed net income or  undistributed capital gain may not be allocated or ``thrown back'' to a  taxable year of a trust if such year is not a ``preceding taxable  year.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accumulation distributions. In the case of an accumulation  distribution consisting of undistributed net income made in a taxable  year beginning before January 1, 1974, any taxable year of the trust  that precedes by more than   5 years the taxable year of the trust in which such accumulation  distribution was made is not a ``preceding taxable year.'' Thus, for a  domestic trust on a calendar year basis, calendar year 1967 is not a  ``preceding taxable year'' with respect to an accumulation distribution  made in calendar year 1973, whereas calendar year 1968 is a ``preceding  taxable year.'' In the case of an accumulation distribution made during  a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973, any taxable year of  the trust that begins before January 1, 1969, is not a ``preceding  taxable year.'' Thus, for a domestic trust on a calendar year basis,  calendar year 1968 is not a ``preceding taxable year'' with respect to  an accumulation distribution made in calendar year 1975, whereas  calendar year 1969 is a ``preceding taxable year.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Capital gain distributions. In the case of an accumulation  distribution that is a capital gain distribution, any taxable year of  the trust that (a) begins before January 1, 1969, or (b) is prior to the  first year in which income is accumulated, whichever occurs later, is  not a ``preceding taxable year.'' Thus, for the purpose of capital gain  distributions and section 669, only taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1968, can be ``preceding taxable years.'' See Sec.  1.688(a)-1A(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign trusts created by U.S. persons. For purposes of subpart  D, in the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the term  ``preceding taxable year'' does not include any taxable year to which  part I of subchapter J does not apply. See section 683 and regulations  thereunder. Accordingly, the provisions of subpart D may not, in the  case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, be applied to any  taxable year which begins before 1954 or ends before August 17, 1954.  For example, if a foreign trust created by a U.S. person (reporting on  the calendar year basis) makes a distribution during the calendar year  1970 of income accumulated during prior years, the earliest year of the  trust to which the accumulation distribution may be allocated under such  subpart D is 1954, but it may not be allocated to 1953 and prior years,  since the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies to those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-1.  Some examples of ``outside income'' are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Income taxable to the trust under section 691;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unrealized accounts receivable that were assigned to the trust;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions from another trust that include distributable net  income or undistributed net income of such other trust.  The term outside income, however, does not include amounts received as  distributions from an estate, other than income specified in (1) and  (2), for which the estate was allowed a deduction under section 661(a).  The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. By his will D creates a trust for his widow W. The terms  of the trust require that the income be distributed currently (i.e., it  is a simple trust), and authorize the trustee to make discretionary  payments of corpus to W. Upon W's death the trust corpus is to be  distributed to D's then living issue. The executor of D's will makes a  $10,000 distribution of corpus to the trust that carries out estate  income consisting of dividends and interest to the trust under section  662(a)(2). The trust reports this income as its only income on its  income tax return for its taxable year in which ends the taxable year of  the estate in which the $10,000 distribution was made, and pays a tax  thereon of $2,106. Thus, the trust has undistributed net income of  $7,894 ($10,000 -$2,106). Several years later the trustee makes a  discretionary corpus payment of $15,000 to W. This payment is an  accumulation distribution under section   665(b). However, since the trust had no ``outside income'' in the year  of the estate distribution, such year is not a preceding taxable year.  Thus, W is not treated as receiving undistributed net income of $7,894  and taxes thereon of $2,106 for the purpose of including the same in her  gross income under section 668. The result would be the same if the  invasion power were not exercised and the accumulation distribution  occurred as a result of the distribution of the corpus to D's issue upon  the death of W.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Trust A, a simple trust on the calendar year basis,  received in 1972 extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends that  the trustee in good faith allocated to corpus, but that are determined  in 1974 to have been currently distributable to the beneficiary. See  section 643(a)(4) and Sec. 1.643(a)-4. Trust A would qualify for  treatment under subpart C for 1974, the year of distribution of the  extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends, because the  distribution is not out of income of the current taxable year and is  treated as another amount properly paid or credited or required to be  distributed for such taxable year within the meaning of section 661(a)  (2). Also, the distribution in 1974 qualifies as an accumulation  distribution for the purposes of subpart D. For purposes only of such  subpart D, trust A would be treated as subject to the provisions of such  subpart C for 1972, the preceding taxable year in which the  extraordinary or taxable stock dividends were received, and, in  computing undistributed net income for 1972, the extraordinary or  taxable stock dividends would be included in distributable net income  under section 643(a). The rule stated in the preceding sentence would  also apply if the distribution in 1974 was made out of corpus without  regard to a determination that the extraordinary dividends or taxable  stock dividends in question were currently distributable to the  beneficiary.

For purposes of computing the amount of capital gain under this  paragraph, no deduction under section 1202, relating to deduction for  excess of capital gains over capital losses, shall be taken into  account. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Under the terms of the trust, the trustee must distribute  all income currently and has discretion to distribute capital gain to A  or to allocate it to corpus. During the taxable year 1971 the trust  recognized capital gain in the amount of $15,000, and capital losses of  $5,000, and had interest income (after expenses) of $6,000. The trustee  distributed $8,000 to A, consisting of $6,000 of interest and $2,000 of  capital gain. The $2,000 of gain distributed to A is included in the  computation of distributable net income under Sec. 1.643(a)-3. The  balance of the capital gain is not included in distributable net income  since it is allocated to corpus and not paid, credited, or required to  be distributed to any beneficiary. The trust paid taxes of $671, all of  which are attributable under Sec. 1.665(d)-1A to the undistributed  capital gain. The amount of undistributed capital gain of the trust for  1971 is therefore $7,329, computed as follows:  Total capital gains..........................................    $15,000 Less: Capital losses.........................................      5,000</p><p class="depth0">------------ Gains in excess of losses....................................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">============ Less: Amount of capital gain included in distributable net income..      2,000</p><p class="depth0">Taxes imposed on the trust attributable to the                     671</p><p class="depth0">undistributed capital gain (see Sec. 1.665(d)-1A).......</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">2,671</p><p class="depth0">------------ Undistributed capital gain...................................      7,329</p><p class="depth0">============</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and the regulations thereunder. For  example, assume that a trust had a net long-term capital loss in 1970 of  $5,000. During the years 1971 through 1975, the trust had no capital  gains or capital losses. In 1976, it has a long-term capital gain of  $8,000, which it allocates to corpus and does not distribute to a  beneficiary, but has no taxes attributable to such gain. The  undistributed capital gain for 1976 is $8,000-$5,000, or $3,000, even  though all or a part of the $5,000 loss was claimed under section 1211  as a deduction in years 1970 through 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Foreign trusts. Distributable net income for a taxable year of a  foreign trust created by a U.S. person includes capital gains in excess  of capital losses for such year (see Sec. 1.643(a)-6(a)(3)). Thus, a  foreign trust created by a U.S. person can never have any undistributed  capital gain.

See Sec. 1.665(b)-1A for the definition of ``accumulation  distribution''. For any such taxable year the undistributed capital gain  includes the total undistributed capital gain for all years of the trust  beginning with the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1968,  in which income (as determined under section 643(b)) is accumulated, and  ending before such taxable year.
