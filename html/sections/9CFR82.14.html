                            <p class="depth0">An area will be removed from quarantine only when all of the  following requirements have been met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All birds and poultry exposed to Newcastle disease in the  quarantined area have been found to be free of Newcastle disease;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All birds and poultry infected with Newcastle disease in the  quarantined area have been euthanized;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All birds and poultry, including any parts of the birds and  poultry, euthanized in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section,  and all birds and poultry in the quarantined area, including any parts  of the birds and poultry, that died from any cause other than slaughter,  have been buried, reduced to ashes by incineration, rendered, or reduced  to dust by composting:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the birds and poultry are buried, all birds and poultry  infected with Newcastle disease must be buried in the quarantined area.  The birds and poultry must be buried in a location that meets all United  States Environmental Protection Agency, State, and local requirements  for landfills. They must be buried at least 6 feet deep and be covered  at the time of burial with soil; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the birds and poultry are composted, all birds and poultry  infected with Newcastle disease must be composted in the quarantined  area. The birds and poultry must be composted according to the following  instructions or according to another procedure approved by the  Administrator as being adequate to prevent the dissemination of  Newcastle disease:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Place a 1-foot layer of litter and manure in a free-standing  composter bin, unless the compost pile will be covered in accordance  with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Add a 6-inch   layer of straw, peanut hulls, or wood chips. Add a layer of dead birds  or dead poultry, leaving 6 inches between the carcasses and the bin  walls. Add water sparingly and cover with 6 inches of a dry mixture of  litter and manure. Repeat the layering process two more times and cap  with a double layer of dry manure cake. After the bin is capped off and  covered, monitor the temperature in the compost pile daily, using a 36- inch probe-type thermometer. The temperature of the compost pile must  reach at least 140 [deg]F. After 30 days from the date the compost pile  is created, turn over to aerate the entire mixture. Allow mixture to  reach at least 140 [deg]F once again. After completion of the second  cycle, the mixture must remain covered with any material that prevents  penetration of air and moisture until spread or otherwise utilized. The  composted material may not be spread or otherwise utilized until at  least 30 days following completion of the second heating cycle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Composting of birds and poultry may be accomplished outside of  covered bins by following the layering and temperature requirements set  forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then covering the compost  pile with tarpaulins or 6-mm polyethylene sheets anchored with tires or  straw bales. The mixture must be kept moist. The final product may not  be spread or otherwise utilized until at least 30 days following  completion of the second heating cycle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Composting of birds and poultry must be carried out at least  50 yards from any building or pen where poultry and birds are housed and  be inaccessible to birds and poultry. Composted material may not be  commingled with, or otherwise be brought into contact with, non- composted manure cake;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All eggs produced by birds or poultry infected with or exposed  to Newcastle disease in the quarantined area have been buried, reduced  to ashes by incineration, or rendered. If the eggs are buried, the eggs  must be buried in the quarantined area in a location that meets all  United States Environmental Protection Agency requirements and all State  and local requirements for landfills. The eggs must be buried at least 6  feet deep and be covered at the time of burial with soil;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All manure generated by or litter used by birds or poultry  infected with or exposed to Newcastle disease in the quarantined area  has been reduced to ashes by incineration, or has been buried,  composted, or spread on a field and turned under, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Burial. If the manure or litter is buried, the manure and litter  must be buried at least 6 feet deep and covered at the time of burial  with soil. The manure and litter must be buried in the quarantined area  in a location that meets all United States Environmental Protection  Agency and State and local requirements for landfills;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Composting. If the manure and litter is composted, the manure  and litter must be composted in the quarantined area. The manure and  litter must be composted according to the following method, or according  to another procedure approved by the Administrator as being adequate to  prevent the dissemination of Newcastle disease: Place the manure and  litter in rows 3 to 5 feet high and 5 to 10 feet at the base. The area  where the manure, litter, and other material used in composting are  placed must be such that there is no runoff from the composted material  out of the area, no saturation into the ground, and no moisture, except  for that required by this paragraph, onto the composted material from  above. The composting area must be at least 50 yards from any building  or pen where birds or poultry are housed and be inaccessible to birds  and poultry. The manure and litter must be mixed so as to attain a  carbon to nitrogen ratio of approximately 30:1, a moisture content of  between 40 to 50 percent, and a supply of oxygen to the composted  material. If a carbon source other than manure or litter is needed, wood  chips, straw, or peanut hulls may be used. The manure and litter must be  covered with tarpaulin or 6-mm polyethylene sheets, be anchored with  tires or straw bales, and be mixed to ensure adequate ventilation every  10 to 15 days. The composted material must rise to a temperature of 140  [deg]F, as determined by use of a 36-inch probe-type thermometer. The  composted material may not be spread or otherwise utilized for at least  30 days from the time the 140 [deg]F temperature is reached; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Spreading and turning under. Spreading and turning under of  manure or litter may be used as a means of disposal only if carried out  under the direct supervision of a Federal representative or a State  representative. If the manure or litter is spread on a field and turned  under, the field must be in the quarantined area, at least 50 yards away  from any building or pen where poultry or birds are housed, and  inaccessible to birds and poultry. The manure or litter must be turned  under within 24 hours of being spread on the field, and the field must  be left undisturbed for at least 30 days;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All vehicles with which the birds or poultry infected with or  exposed to Newcastle disease or their excrement or litter have had  physical contact have been cleaned and disinfected in accordance with  part 71 of this chapter. The vehicles have been inspected after  cleaning, and before disinfection, by a Federal representative or State  representative, and then have been disinfected in the presence of a  Federal representative or State representative with a disinfectant  listed in part 71 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other equipment used  for birds or poultry infected with or exposed to Newcastle disease, or  their excrement or litter have been reduced to ashes by incineration, or  have been cleaned and disinfected in accordance with part 71 of this  chapter. The items must be inspected after cleaning, and before  disinfection, by a Federal representative or State representative, and  then must be disinfected in the presence of a Federal representative or  State representative, with a disinfectant listed in part 71 of this  chapter; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The premises where birds or poultry infected with or exposed to  Newcastle disease were located have been cleaned and disinfected in  accordance with part 71 of this chapter. The premises have been  inspected after cleaning, and before disinfection, by a Federal  representative or State representative, and then have been disinfected  in the presence of a Federal representative or State representative with  a disinfectant listed in part 71 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> After the other conditions of this section are fulfilled, an  area will not be released from quarantine until followup surveillance  over a period of time determined by the Administrator indicates  Newcastle disease is not present in the quarantined area.
