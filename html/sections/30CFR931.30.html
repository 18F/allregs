Mining and Minerals shall assume the primary authority pursuant  to sections 510(a) and 523(c) of the Federal Act for the analysis,  review, and approval of the permit application or application for a  permit revision or renewal according to the standards of the Program.  OSM shall assist Mining and Minerals in the analysis of the permit  application or application for a permit revision or renewal according to  the procedures set forth in appendix B. The Department shall  concurrently carry out its responsibilities under the Mineral Leasing  Act, as amended (MLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and  other public laws (including but not limited to those in appendix A)  that cannot, under the Federal Act, be delegated to the State. The  Department shall carry out these responsibilities according to the  procedures set forth in appendix B so as to avoid, to the maximum extent  possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State set forth in  this Agreement and the State Program. The Secretary will consider the  information in the permit application package and, where appropriate,  make the decisions required by the Federal Act, MLA, NEPA and other  public laws listed above.</p><p class="depth0">13. Mining and Minerals shall be the primary point of contact with  the operator. The Department will independently initiate contacts with  the applicant regarding permit application packages or applications for  a permit revision or renewal only where necessary to carry out its  statutory responsibilities. When such action may generate correspondence  with the applicant, a copy of all correspondence with the applicant that  may have a bearing on decisions regarding the mining operation shall be  sent to Mining and Minerals.</p><p class="depth0">14. Mining and Minerals shall maintain a file of all original  correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the  applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding the permit  application package or application for a permit revision or renewal. At  the request of the Secretary or his designated agents, Mining and  Minerals shall make available the Mining and Minerals files and send  copies of such correspondence and information when requested to do so.</p><p class="depth0">15. To the fullest extent allowed by State and Federal law, OSM and  Mining and Minerals shall cooperate so that duplication will be  eliminated in conducting the review and analysis of the permit  application package or application for a permit revision or renewal.</p><p class="depth0">16. Mining and Minerals will review the permit application or  application for a permit revision or renewal under sections 11-11  through 11-29 of the New Mexico Coal Surface Mining Commission Rule 80- 1.</p><p class="depth0">Article VIII: Inspections</p><p class="depth0">17. Mining and Minerals shall conduct inspections on Federal lands  and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with its Program.</p><p class="depth0">18. Mining and Minerals shall, subsequent to conducting any  inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM on a timely basis, an  inspection report adequately describing (1) the general conditions of  the lands; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted;  and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance  and reclamation requirements.</p><p class="depth0">19. Mining and Minerals will be the point of contact and primary  inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations  and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except  as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent  inspections by authorized Federal agencies for purposes other than those  covered by this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">20. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply  with 30 CFR parts 842 and 743.</p><p class="depth0">21. Except as provided below, the Secretary shall give Mining and  Minerals reasonable notice of his intent to conduct an inspection   in order to provide State inspectors an opportunity to join in the  inspection. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections  without prior notice to Mining and Minerals to carry out his  responsibilities under the Federal Act.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX: Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">22. Mining and Minerals shall be the primary enforcement authority  under the Federal Act concerning compliance with the requirements of  this Agreement and the Program. Enforcement authority of the Secretary  under other laws and orders including, but not limited to, those listed  in appendix A is reserved to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0">23. During any joint inspection by OSM and Mining and Minerals,  Mining and Minerals shall have primary responsibility for enforcement  procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of  violation and assessment of penalties. OSM and Mining and Minerals shall  consult prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.</p><p class="depth0">24. Mining and Minerals and OSM shall promptly notify each other of  all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, approved mining  plans and permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken  with respect to such violations.</p><p class="depth0">25. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection  where Mining and Minerals and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety  of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement  action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.</p><p class="depth0">Such enforcement action shall be based on the performance standards  included in the regulations of the Program, and the procedures and  penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. This Agreement  does not limit the Department's authority to enforce violations of  standards and requirements of Federal laws other than the Federal Act.</p><p class="depth0">26. Personnel of the State and the Department shall be mutually  available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either  party.</p><p class="depth0">Article X: Bonds</p><p class="depth0">27. For all surface coal mines on Federal lands, Mining and Minerals  and the Secretary shall require all operators to submit a single  performance bond to cover the operator's responsibilities under the  Federal Act and the Program, payable to the State, and if required by  Federal regulations in Subchapter D, the United States. The performance  bond shall be of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of  both State and Federal law and release of the bond shall be conditioned  upon compliance with all applicable State and Federal requirements. If  the cooperative agreement is terminated, the bonds will revert to being  payable only to the United States to the extent that Federal lands are  involved. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the  requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR 3474 or a  lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in  certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Federal Act.</p><p class="depth0">28. Prior to releasing the operator from an obligation under the  performance bond required by the Program for any Federal lands, Mining  and Minerals shall obtain the consent of OSM. Mining and Minerals shall  also advise OSM of adjustments to the performance bond.</p><p class="depth0">29. The operator's performance bond shall be subject to forfeiture  with the consent of the Department, in accordance with the procedures  and requirements of the Program.</p><p class="depth0">Article XI: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types</p><p class="depth0">of Surface Coal Mining</p><p class="depth0">30. Mining and Minerals and the Director shall cooperate with each  other in the review and processing of petitions to designate lands as  unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. When either agency  receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal  lands, the agency receiving the petition shall (1) notify the other of  receipt and of the anticipated scheduled for reaching a decision; and  (2) request and fully consider data, information and the views of the  other.</p><p class="depth0">The authority to designate State and private lands as unsuitable for  mining is reserved to the State. The authority to designate Federal  lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary or his  designated representative.</p><p class="depth0">Article XII: Termination of Cooperative Agreement</p><p class="depth0">31. This Agreement may be terminated by the State or the Department  under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.</p><p class="depth0">Article XIII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement</p><p class="depth0">32. If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part it may  be reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.</p><p class="depth0">Article XIV: Amendments of Cooperative Agreement</p><p class="depth0">33. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the State  and the Department. An amendment proposed by one party shall be  submitted to the other with a statement of the reasons for such proposed  amendment. The amendment shall be adopted after Federal rulemaking in  accordance with 30 CFR 745.11. The party to whom the   proposed amendment is submitted shall signify its acceptance or  rejection of the proposed amendment, and if rejected shall state the  reasons for rejection.</p><p class="depth0">Article XV: Changes in State or Federal Standards</p><p class="depth0">34. The Department or the State may from time to time promulgate new  or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and  administration procedures. Each party shall, it it determines it to be  necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its  regulations and request necessary legislative action. Such changes shall  be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the State  Program, and under the procedures of section 501 of the Federal Act for  changes to the Federal Lands Program.</p><p class="depth0">35. The State and the Department shall provide each other with  copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations and  standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this  Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVI: Changes in Personnel and Organization</p><p class="depth0">36. The State and the Department shall, consistent with 30 CFR  745.12, advise each other of changes in the organization, structure,  functions, duties and funds of the offices, departments, divisions and  persons within their organizations. Each shall promptly advise the other  in writing of changes in key personnel, including the head of a  department or division, or changes in the functions or duties of persons  occupying the principal offices within the structure of the Program. The  State and the Department shall advise each other in writing of changes  in the location of offices, addresses, telephone numbers and changes in  the names, locations and telephone numbers of their respective mine  inspectors and the area within the State for which such inspectors are  responsible.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVII: Definitions</p><p class="depth0">37. Terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in  the Federal Act, 30 CFR 700, 701, and 740, and defined in the New Mexico  Surface Mining Act (69-25A-1, et seq., NMSA 1978) and the rules and  regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, shall be given the  meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict  between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the  definitions used in the approved Program will apply, except in the case  of a term which defines the Secretary's remaining responsibilities under  the Federal Act and other laws.</p><p class="depth0">Article XVIII. Reservation of Rights</p><p class="depth0">38. In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be  construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have  not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the  Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not  limited to those listed in appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Dated: December 7, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">Bruce King,</p><p class="depth0">Governor of New Mexico.</p><p class="depth0">Dated: November 24, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">James G.
