                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the event that a State decides to cease participation in the  refugee program, the State must provide 120 days advance notice to the  Director before withdrawing from the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. In the event that a State wishes to  retain responsibility for only part of the refugee program, it must  obtain prior approval from the Director of ORR. Such approval will be  granted if it is in the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, and subpart  L. Replacement designees must also adhere to the Subpart L regulations  regarding formula allocation grants for targeted assistance, if the  State authorized the replacement designee appointed by the Director to  act as its agent in applying for and receiving targeted assistance  funds. Certain provisions are excepted because they apply only to States  and become moot when a State withdraws from participation in the refugee  program and is replaced by another entity. States would continue to be  responsible for administering the other excepted provisions because  these provisions refer to the administration of other State-run public  assistance programs.
