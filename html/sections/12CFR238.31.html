                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior notice requirement. Any person acting directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons, shall give the Board 60 days' written notice, as specified in Sec. 238.33 of this subpart, before acquiring control of a savings and loan holding company, unless the acquisition is exempt under Sec. 238.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquisition includes a purchase, assignment, transfer, or pledge of voting securities, or an increase in percentage ownership of a savings and loan holding company resulting from a redemption of voting securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acting in concert includes knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards a common goal of acquiring control of a savings and loan holding company whether or not pursuant to an express agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Immediate family includes a person's father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, grandparent, grandson, granddaughter, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, the spouse of any of the foregoing, and the person's spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acquisitions requiring prior notice --(1) Acquisition of control. The acquisition of voting securities of a savings and loan holding company constitutes the acquisition of control under the Bank Control Act, requiring prior notice to the Board, if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person (or persons acting in concert) will own, control, or hold with power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acquisition of control. The acquisition of voting securities of a savings and loan holding company constitutes the acquisition of control under the Bank Control Act, requiring prior notice to the Board, if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person (or persons acting in concert) will own, control, or hold with power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuttable presumption of control. The Board presumes that an acquisition of voting securities of a savings and loan holding company constitutes the acquisition of control under the Bank Control Act, requiring prior notice to the Board, if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person (or persons acting in concert) will own,

control, or hold with power to vote 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution, and if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The institution has registered securities under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.\2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\2\ If two or more persons, not acting in concert, each propose to acquire simultaneously equal percentages of 10 percent or more of a class of voting securities of the savings and loan holding company, each person must file prior notice to the Board.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rebuttable presumption of concerted action. The following persons shall be presumed to be acting in concert for purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A company and any principal shareholder, partner, trustee, or management official of the company, if both the company and the person own voting securities of the savings and loan holding company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An individual and the individual's immediate family;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Companies under common control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Persons that are parties to any agreement, contract, understanding, relationship, or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise, regarding the acquisition, voting, or transfer of control of voting securities of a savings and loan holding company, other than through a revocable proxy as described in Sec. 238.32(a)(5) of this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Persons that have made, or propose to make, a joint filing under sections 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78n), and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A person and any trust for which the person serves as trustee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acquisitions of loans in default. The Board presumes an acquisition of a loan in default that is secured by voting securities of a savings and loan holding company to be an acquisition of the underlying securities for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other transactions. Transactions other than those set forth in paragraph (c) of this section resulting in a person's control of less than 25 percent of a class of voting securities of a savings and loan holding company are not deemed by the Board to constitute control for purposes of the Bank Control Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rebuttal of presumptions. Prior notice to the Board is not required for any acquisition of voting securities under the presumption of control set forth in this section, if the Board finds that the acquisition will not result in control. The Board shall afford any person seeking to rebut a presumption in this section an opportunity to present views in writing or, if appropriate, orally before its designated representatives at an informal conference.</p>
