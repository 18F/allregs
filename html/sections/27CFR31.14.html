                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for failure to comply  with the requirements of this part are imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5603 and  5687. A failure to register as required by this part may result in a  penalty under 26 U.S.C. 5603(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative penalty. An administrative penalty for failure to  supply the required identifying number (employer identification number)  in a dealer's registration is imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6723. The penalty is  $50 for each such failure, but not more than $100,000 for all such  failures during a calendar year. A failure to submit a registration  includes a failure to include the identifying number on the  registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable cause. The administrative penalty described in  paragraph (b) of this section is not imposed when it is shown that the  failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. A  dealer who believes that the circumstances that led to the failure were  reasonable and who desires to have the penalty waived shall submit a  written statement, under the penalty of perjury, affirmatively showing  all of the circumstances alleged as reasonable causes for the failure.  If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the failure was due to a  reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the penalty will not be  assessed. If the dealer exercised ordinary business care and prudence  but was nevertheless unable to comply with the requirement, then the  failure was due to reasonable cause. Mere ignorance of the law will not  be considered a reasonable cause.  (26 U.S.C. 5603, 5687, 6109, 6723, 6724)</p>
