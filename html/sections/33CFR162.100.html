                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emergency Mooring Buoys. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has established four pairs of emergency mooring bouys. Each buoy is 10 feet in diameter with retro-reflective sides. The two buoys which comprise each pair are 585 feet apart and are located approximately at:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Indiana Bank--Mile 582.3 (near 18 Mile Island);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Six Mile Island--Mile 597.5;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Six Mile Island--Mile 598.2; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Kentucky Bank--Mile 599.8 (Cox's Park).</p><p class="depth3">Note: All buoys, except those at Six Mile Island--Mile 598.2, are removed between May 1 and September 30. Due to the close proximity of the municipal water intakes, mooring of tank vessels laden with petroleum products or hazardous materials is not authorized on the Kentucky Bank, Mile 599.8 (Cox's Park).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The regulations. A vessel must not use the emergency mooring buoys that have been established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, unless specifically authorized. The Captain of the Port, upon request, may authorize the use of the emergency mooring buoys by downbound towing vessels that are awaiting Vessel Traffic Center approval to proceed.
