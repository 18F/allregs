                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Director of the Office of Government Ethics may issue a Certificate of Divestiture for specific property in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 2634.1005 of this subpart if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director determines that divestiture of the property by an eligible person is reasonably necessary to comply with 18 U.S.C. 208, or any other Federal conflict of interest statute, regulation, rule, or Executive order; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A congressional committee requires divestiture as a condition of confirmation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director of the Office of Government Ethics cannot issue a Certificate of Divestiture for property that already has been sold.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1 to Sec. 2634.1004: An employee is directed to divest shares of stock, a limited partnership interest, and foreign currencies. If the sale of these assets will result in capital gains under the Internal Revenue Code, the employee may request and receive a Certificate of Divestiture.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2 to Sec. 2634.1004: An employee of the Department of Commerce is directed to divest his shares of XYZ stock acquired through the exercise of options held in an employee benefit plan. His gain from the sale of the stock will be treated as ordinary income. Because only capital gains realized under Federal tax law are eligible for deferral under section 1043, a Certificate of Divestiture cannot be issued for the sale of the XYZ stock.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3 to Sec. 2634.1004: During her Senate confirmation hearing, a nominee to a Department of Defense (DOD) position is directed to divest stock in a DOD contractor as a condition of her confirmation. Eager to comply with the order to divest, the nominee sells her stock immediately after the hearing and prior to being confirmed by the Senate. Once she is a DOD employee, she requests a Certificate of Divestiture for the stock. Because the Office of Government Ethics cannot issue a Certificate of Divestiture for property that has already been divested, the employee's request for a Certificate of Divestiture will be denied.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4 to Sec. 2634.1004: After receiving a Certificate of Divestiture, the spouse of a Food and Drug Administration employee sold stock in a regulated company. Between the time of the request for the Certificate of Divestiture and the sale of the stock, the stock price dropped and the spouse sold the stock at a loss. Because the sale of the stock

did not result in capital gains, the spouse has no need for the Certificate of Divestiture and cannot submit it to the Internal Revenue Service for deferral of gains. No further action need be taken by the employee or the employee's spouse in connection with the Certificate of Divestiture.</p>
