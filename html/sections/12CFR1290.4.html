When FHFA receives the additional information, it shall again deem the community support statement complete and resume the 75-day time period where it stopped. FHFA will have 10 calendar days in addition to the 75-day time period to act on a community support statement if FHFA receives the additional information on or after the seventieth day of the 75-day time period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision on community support statements.
