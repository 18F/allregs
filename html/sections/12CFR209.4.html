Such application shall be filed promptly after the first report of condition that reflects the increase or decrease occasioning the adjustment. In addition, every member bank shall file an application for issue or cancellation of Reserve Bank capital stock if needed in order to adjust its Reserve Bank capital stock subscription to equal six percent of the member bank's capital and surplus as shown on its report of condition as of December 31 of each year promptly after filing such report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Capital Stock and Surplus defined. Capital stock and surplus of a member bank means the paid-in capital stock \4\ and paid-in surplus of the bank, less any deficit in the aggregate of its retained earnings, gains (losses) on available for sale securities, and foreign currency translation accounts, all as shown on the bank's most recent report of condition.

The total subscription of a member bank that is a mutual savings bank shall equal six-tenths of 1 percent of its total deposit liabilities as shown on its most recent report of condition. Whenever any member bank that is a mutual savings bank experiences a cumulative increase or decrease in total deposit liabilities as shown on its most recent report of condition requiring a change in its holding of Reserve Bank stock in excess of the lesser of 15 percent or 100 shares, it shall file with the appropriate Reserve Bank an application for issue or cancellation of Reserve Bank capital stock in order to adjust its Reserve Bank capital stock subscription to equal six-tenths of 1 percent of the member bank's total deposit liabilities. Such application shall be filed promptly after the first report of condition that reflects the increase or decrease occasioning the adjustment. In addition, every member bank that is a mutual savings bank shall file an application for issue or cancellation of Reserve Bank capital stock if needed in order to adjust its Reserve Bank capital stock subscription to equal six-tenths of 1 percent of its total deposit liabilities as shown on its report of condition as of December 31 of each year promptly after filing such report. A mutual savings bank that is applying for or has a deposit with the appropriate Reserve Bank in lieu of Reserve Bank capital stock shall file for acceptance or adjustment of its deposit in a like manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment for subscriptions. Upon approval by the Reserve Bank of an application for capital stock (or for a deposit in lieu thereof), the applying bank shall pay the Reserve Bank one-half of the subscription amount plus accrued dividends.

The remaining half of the subscription or additional subscription (including subscriptions for deposits or additions to deposits) shall be subject to call by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Payment for cancellations. (1) Upon approval of an application for cancellation of Reserve Bank capital stock, or (in the case of involuntary termination of membership) upon the effective date of cancellation specified in Sec. 209.3(c)(3), the Reserve Bank shall reduce the bank's shareholding on the Reserve Bank's books by the number of shares required to be canceled and shall pay therefor a sum equal to the cash subscription paid on the canceled stock plus accrued dividends (at the rate specified in paragraph (d) of this section), such sum not to exceed the book value of the stock. \5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Under sections 6 and 9(10) of the Act, a Reserve Bank is under no obligation to pay unearned accrued dividends on redemption of its capital stock from an insolvent member bank for which a receiver has been appointed or from state member banks on voluntary withdrawal from or involuntary termination of membership.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of any cancellation of Reserve Bank stock under this Part, the Reserve Bank may first apply such sum to any liability of the bank to the Reserve Bank and pay over the remainder to the bank (or receiver or conservator, as appropriate).</p>
