                            <p class="depth0">The Administrative Law Judge may grant a rehearing or reopen a proceeding at any time for the purpose of hearing any relevant and material evidence which was not known or obtainable at the time of the original hearing. A report for rehearing or reopening must contain a summary of such evidence, and must explain the reasons why it could not have been presented at the original hearing. The Administrative Law Judge will inform the parties of any further hearing, and will conduct such hearing and submit a report and recommendations in the same manner as provided for the original proceeding (Described in Sec. 128.10).
