                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An EMTU and its forms software must support a minimum of 20 Electronic Forms, and meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form Validation: Each field on a form must be capable of being defined as Optional, Mandatory, or Logic Driven. Mandatory fields are those fields that must be entered by the user before the form is complete. Optional fields are those fields that do not require data entry. Logic driven fields have their attributes determined by earlier form selections. Specifically, a logic driven field must allow for selection of options in that field to change the values available as menu selections on a subsequent field within the same form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A user must be able to select forms from a menu on the EMTU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A user must be able to populate a form based on the last values used and ``modify'' or ``update'' a prior submission without unnecessary re-entry of data. A user must be able to review a minimum of 20 past form submissions and ascertain for each form when the form was transmitted and whether delivery was successfully sent to the type-approval holder's VMS data processing center. In the case of a transmission failure, a user must be provided with details of the cause and have the opportunity to retry the form submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> VMS Position Report: Each form must capable of including VMS position data, including latitude, longitude, date and time. Data to populate these fields must be automatically generated by the EMTU and unable to be manually entered or altered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Delivery Format for Form Data: Delivery of form data to NMFS must employ the same transport security and reliability as VMS position and declaration reports. The SMTP protocol is not permitted for the transmission of data that is delivered to NMFS. The field coding within the data must follow either CSV or XML formatting rules. For CSV format the form must contain an identifier and the version number, and then the fields in the order defined on the form. In the CSV format strings that may contain ``,'' (comma) characters must be quoted. XML representations must use the field label to define the XML element that contains each field value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Updates to Forms. (1) The EMTU and MCS must be capable of providing updates to forms or adding new form requirements via wireless transmission and without manual installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EMTU and MCS must be capable of providing updates to forms or adding new form requirements via wireless transmission and without manual installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From time to time, NMFS may provide type-approved vendors with requirements for new forms or modifications to existing forms. NMFS may also provide notice of forms and form changes through the NMFS Work Order System. Type-approved vendors will be given at least 60 calendar days to complete their implementation of new or changed forms. Vendors will be capable of, and responsible for translating the requirements into their EMTU-specific forms definitions and wirelessly transmitting the same to all EMTU terminals supplied to fishing vessels.</p>
