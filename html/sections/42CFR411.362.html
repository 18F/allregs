An applicable hospital is a  hospital that satisfies all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Population increase. Is located in a county that has a  percentage increase in population that is at least 150 percent of the  percentage increase in population of the State in which the hospital is  located during the most recent 5-year period for which data are  available as of the date that the hospital submits its request.

CMS will provide on its  Web site State average bed capacities and the national average bed  capacity. For purposes of this paragraph, ``sufficient number'' means  the number of hospitals, as determined by CMS, that would ensure that  the determination under this paragraph would not materially change after  additional hospital data are reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Average bed occupancy.
