Such a designation shall expire ten years after the date of submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will provide a submitter with written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing designated business information when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as confidential commercial information deemed protected from disclosure under Sec. 792.11(a)(4); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NCUA has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Sec. 792.11(a)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A copy of the notice to the submitter will also be provided to the FOIA requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Through the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section, NCUA will afford the submitter a reasonable period of time within which to provide a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement must describe why the information is confidential commercial information and why it should not be disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Whenever we decide that we must disclose confidential commercial information over the objection of the submitter, we will send both the submitter and the FOIA requester, within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date, a written notice which will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objection was not sustained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a requester brings suit to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, we will promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The notice requirements of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We determine that the information should not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by law; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that in such case, NCUA will provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date.</p><p class="depth3">Release of Exempt Information</p>
