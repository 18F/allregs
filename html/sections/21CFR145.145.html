Such food is sealed in a container and, before or after sealing, is so processed by heat as to prevent spoilage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Optional grapefruit ingredient. The optional grapefruit ingredients referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are prepared from sound, mature grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfadyen) of the color types white--produced from white-fleshed grapefruit, and pink--produced from pink or red-fleshed grapefruit and are in the following forms of units: Whole sections or broken sections. Each such form of units or a mixture of such forms of units prepared from a single varietal group (color type) is an optional grapefruit ingredient. The core, seeds, and major portions of membrane of such ingredient are removed. For the purpose of this section, a grapefruit section is considered whole when the unit is intact or an intact portion of such unit is not less than 75 percent of its apparent original size and is not excessively trimmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the name of the optional grapefruit ingredient is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> ``Section'' or ``segments'', if 50 percent or more of the drained weight of the food consists of whole sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> ``Broken sections'' or ``broken segments'', if less than 50 percent of the drained weight of the food consists of whole sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The drained weight is determined by the method prescribed in the standard of fill of container for canned grapefruit set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Packing media.

As used in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the optional packing medium ``water'' means, in addition to water, any mixture of water and grapefruit juice in which there is less than 50 percent grapefruit juice; the optional packing medium ``grapefruit juice and water'' means the liquid packing medium in which juice of mature grapefruit and water are combined as a liquid packing medium with not less than 50 percent grapefruit juice and the term ``grapefruit juice'' means single strength expressed juice of sound, mature fruit. It may be fresh, canned, or made from concentrate. However, if it is made from concentrate, the juice shall be reconstituted with water to not less than the soluble solids the grapefruit juice had before concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each of the packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (d) to (l) of this section is prepared with a liquid ingredient and one or more safe and suitable nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners. Water is the liquid ingredient from which packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (d) to (f) of this section are prepared. Grapefruit juice and water are the liquid ingredients from which the packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (g) to (i) of this section are prepared. Grapefruit juice is the liquid ingredient from which the packing media in

paragraph (a)(3)(i) (j) to (l) of this section are prepared. If one or more liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners and grapefruit juice are combined as a liquid packing medium with not less than 50 percent grapefruit juice, the packing medium is as set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (g) to (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The respective densities of packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (d) to (i) of this section as measured on the refractometer, expressed as percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 C (68 F), 15 days or more after the grapefruit are canned or the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container if canned for less than 15 days, according to the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists'' (AOAC), 13th Ed.

Without shifting the material on the sieve, incline the sieve at an angle of 17 to 20 to facilitate drainage. Two minutes after the drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained grapefruit.
