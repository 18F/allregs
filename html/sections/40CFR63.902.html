                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to owners and operators subject to this subpart and controlling air emissions from a tank using a fixed roof. This section does not apply to a fixed-roof tank that is also equipped with an internal floating roof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The tank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid in the tank. The fixed roof may be a separate cover installed on the tank (e.g., a removable cover mounted on an open-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural design (e.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a hatch).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fixed roof shall be installed in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the roof edge and the tank wall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the fixed roof, shall be either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> equipped with a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the opening and the closure device; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> connected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device. The control device shall remove or destroy organics in the vent stream, and shall be operating whenever regulated material is managed in the tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the liquid or its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the tank on which the fixed roof is installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever a regulated-material is in the tank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed position except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the following times:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To provide access to the tank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a worker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the tank, or when a worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the tank.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of tank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Opening of a spring-loaded pressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure relief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations for the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with the tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the device remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is within the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or operator based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal operating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those times when the container internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating range for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Opening of a safety device, as defined in Sec.  63.901 of this subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid an unsafe condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator shall inspect the air emission control equipment in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.  63.906(a) of this subpart.
