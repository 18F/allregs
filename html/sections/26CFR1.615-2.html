                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the election to treat exploration  expenditures under section 615 has been made or is deemed made under  Sec. 1.615-6(b) subject to the total limitation of $100,000, a taxpayer  who has made exploration expenditures prior to January 1, 1970, with  respect to more than one mine or other natural deposit may deduct for a  taxable year for which such election is effective any portion of such  expenditures attributable to each mine or deposit. With respect to a  particular mine or other natural deposit, a taxpayer who has made the  election described in the preceding sentence may deduct under section  615(a) a portion of the exploration expenditures and may defer and  deduct under section 615(b) the balance of such expenditures. For any  taxable year for which the election to treat exploration expenditures  under section 615 is effective, the taxpayer must charge any amount of  exploration expenditures in excess of $100,000 to capital account and  must charge to capital account whatever amount has not been deducted  currently or deferred. For example, taxpayer A who has elected under  section 615(e) has three mines, X, Y, and Z. In the taxable year 1967, A  makes exploration expenditures of $75,000 with respect to each mine. The   total allowable deduction for exploration expenditures is $100,000. A  deducts $50,000 and defers $25,000 with respect to X. He deducts  $25,000, and charges to capital account $50,000 with respect to Y, and  charges to capital account the entire $75,000 paid with respect to Z.  Thus, A has deducted or deferred $100,000 and capitalized the excess.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in section 615(e) and Sec. 1.615-6, a  taxpayer cannot change his treatment of exploration expenditures for a  taxable year after the due date (including extensions of time) for  filing the return for the taxable year except where it is subsequently  determined that any part of such exploration expenditures deducted under  section 615(a) or deferred under section 615(b) are not exploration  expenditures for the taxable year. Where the taxpayer has made the  election to treat exploration expenditures under section 615 and it is  subsequently determined that part of the expenditures deducted under  section 615(a) or deferred under section 615(b), for a taxable year,  were not exploration expenditures for such taxable year, the exploration  expenditures required to be charged to capital account for such taxable  year by reason of the limitation may be deducted or deferred (to the  extent of the subsequent determination) and proper adjustment made to  capital account. A taxpayer claiming a deduction under section 615(a)  shall indicate clearly on his income tax return the amount of the  deduction claimed under such section with respect to each mine or other  natural deposit. Such mine or deposit shall be identified by an adequate  description.  [T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12938, June 30, 1972]</p>
