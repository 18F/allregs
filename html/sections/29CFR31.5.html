Each recipient shall keep such records and  submit to the Secretary timely, complete and accurate compliance reports  at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the  Secretary may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain  whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In  general, recipients should have available for the department racial and  ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are  beneficiaries of federally assisted programs. In the case in which a  primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other  recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance  reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the  primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit  access by the Secretary during normal business hours to such of its  books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its  facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part.  Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive  possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency,  institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information,  the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what  efforts it has made to obtain the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient  shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other  interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this  part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient  receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information  available to them in such manner, as the Secretary finds necessary to  apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured  them by the Act and this part.
