                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Principle. Costs incurred by an HMO or CMP in performing the  enrollment and marketing activities described in subpart k of this part  are allowable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Included costs. Allowable enrollment and marketing costs are  those necessary and proper costs incurred in offering the HMO's or CMP's  plan to potential enrollees in accordance with this part. Those costs  include selling, advertising, promotional, and other marketing costs and  may not exceed an amount that would be incurred by a prudent and cost- conscious management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application. Enrollment and marketing costs are allowable,  whether incurred directly by HMO or CMP staff or under contract with  marketing specialists or other outside consultants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on payment. The relatively higher costs that an HMO  or CMP is likely to incur in initially offering its plan to Medicare  beneficiaries are taken into account in determining whether enrollment  and marketing costs are reasonable in amount. However, if those costs  exceed amounts that would be paid by prudent management, the excess is  not allowable.
