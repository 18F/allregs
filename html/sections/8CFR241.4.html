                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> of  the Act pursuant to the procedures described in this section. Except as  provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the provisions of this  section apply to the custody determinations for the following group of  aliens:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (e)(3)(1994));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alien ordered removed who is removable under section  237(a)(1)(C) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An alien ordered removed who is removable under sections  237(a)(2) or 237(a)(4) of the Act, including deportable criminal aliens  whose cases are governed by former section 242 of the Act prior to  amendment by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility  Act of 1996, Div. C of Public Law 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An alien ordered removed who the decision-maker determines is  unlikely to comply with the removal order or is a risk to the community.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability to particular aliens--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motions to reopen. An  alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for  consideration of relief from removal, including withholding or deferral  of removal pursuant to 8 CFR 208.16 or 208.17, shall remain subject to  the provisions of this section unless the motion to reopen is granted.  Section 236 of the Act and 8 CFR 236.1 govern custody determinations for  aliens who are in pending immigration proceedings before the Executive  Office for Immigration Review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parole for certain Cuban nationals. The review procedures in  this section   do not apply to any inadmissible Mariel Cuban who is being detained by  the Service pending an exclusion or removal proceeding, or following  entry of a final exclusion or pending his or her return to Cuba or  removal to another country. Instead, the determination whether to  release on parole, or to revoke such parole, or to detain, shall in the  case of a Mariel Cuban be governed by the procedures in 8 CFR 212.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of the Act or  withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture  who are otherwise subject to detention are subject to the provisions of  this part 241. Individuals subject to a termination of deferral hearing  under 8 CFR 208.17(d) remain subject to the provisions of this part 241  throughout the termination process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Service determination under 8 CFR 241.13. The custody review  procedures in this section do not apply after the Service has made a  determination, pursuant to the procedures provided in 8 CFR 241.13, that  there is no significant likelihood that an alien under a final order of  removal can be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. However, if  the Service subsequently determines, because of a change of  circumstances, that there is a significant likelihood that the alien may  be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future to the country to which  the alien was ordered removed or to a third country, the alien shall  again be subject to the custody review procedures under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delegation of authority. The Attorney General's statutory  authority to make custody determinations under sections 241(a)(6) and  212(d)(5)(A) of the Act when there is a final order of removal is  delegated as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> District Directors and Directors of Detention and Removal Field  Offices. The initial custody determination described in paragraph (h) of  this section and any further custody determination concluded in the 3  month period immediately following the expiration of the 90-day removal  period, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,  will be made by the district director or the Director of the Detention  and Removal Field Office having jurisdiction over the alien. The  district director or the Director of the Detention and Removal Field  Office shall maintain appropriate files respecting each detained alien  reviewed for possible release, and shall have authority to determine the  order in which the cases shall be reviewed, and to coordinate activities  associated with these reviews in his or her respective jurisdictional  area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Headquarters Post-Order Detention Unit (HQPDU). For any alien  the district director refers for further review after the removal  period, or any alien who has not been released or removed by the  expiration of the three-month period after the review, all further  custody determinations will be made by the Executive Associate  Commissioner, acting through the HQPDU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The HQPDU review plan. The Executive Associate Commissioner  shall appoint a Director of the HQPDU. The Director of the HQPDU shall  have authority to establish and maintain appropriate files respecting  each detained alien to be reviewed for possible release, to determine  the order in which the cases shall be reviewed, and to coordinate  activities associated with these reviews.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional delegation of authority. All references to the  Executive Associate Commissioner, the Director of the Detention and  Removal Field Office, and the district director in this section shall be  deemed to include any person or persons (including a committee)  designated in writing by the Executive Associate Commissioner, the  Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office, or the district  director to exercise powers under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Custody determinations. A copy of any decision by the district  director, Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office, or  Executive Associate Commissioner to release or to detain an alien shall  be provided to the detained alien. A decision to retain custody shall  briefly set forth the reasons for the continued detention. A decision to  release may contain such special conditions as are considered  appropriate in the opinion of the Service. Notwithstanding any other  provisions   of this section, there is no appeal from the district director's or the  Executive Associate Commissioner's decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service of decision and other documents. All notices, decisions,  or other documents in connection with the custody reviews conducted  under this section by the district director, Director of the Detention  and Removal Field Office, or Executive Associate Commissioner shall be  served on the alien, in accordance with 8 CFR 103.8, by the Service  district office having jurisdiction over the alien. Release  documentation (including employment authorization if appropriate) shall  be issued by the district office having jurisdiction over the alien in  accordance with the custody determination made by the district director  or by the Executive Associate Commissioner. Copies of all such documents  will be retained in the alien's record and forwarded to the HQPDU.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alien's representative. The alien's representative is required  to complete Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or  Representative, at the time of the interview or prior to reviewing the  detainee's records. The Service will forward by regular mail a copy of  any notice or decision that is being served on the alien only to the  attorney or representative of record. The alien remains responsible for  notification to any other individual providing assistance to him or her.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Criteria for release. Before making any recommendation or  decision to release a detainee, a majority of the Review Panel members,  or the Director of the HQPDU in the case of a record review, must  conclude that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Travel documents for the alien are not available or, in the  opinion of the Service, immediate removal, while proper, is otherwise  not practicable or not in the public interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The detainee is presently a non-violent person;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The detainee is likely to remain nonviolent if released;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The detainee is not likely to pose a threat to the community  following release;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The detainee is not likely to violate the conditions of release;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The detainee does not pose a significant flight risk if  released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Factors for consideration. The following factors should be  weighed in considering whether to recommend further detention or release  of a detainee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature and number of disciplinary infractions or incident  reports received when incarcerated or while in Service custody;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The detainee's criminal conduct and criminal convictions,  including consideration of the nature and severity of the alien's  convictions, sentences imposed and time actually served, probation and  criminal parole history, evidence of recidivism, and other criminal  history;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any available psychiatric and psychological reports pertaining  to the detainee's mental health;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Evidence of rehabilitation including institutional progress  relating to participation in work, educational, and vocational programs,  where available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Favorable factors, including ties to the United States such as  the number of close relatives residing here lawfully;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Prior immigration violations and history;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The likelihood that the alien is a significant flight risk or  may abscond to avoid removal, including history of escapes, failures to  appear for immigration or other proceedings, absence without leave from  any halfway house or sponsorship program, and other defaults; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any other information that is probative of whether the alien is  likely to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adjust to life in a community,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Engage in future acts of violence,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Engage in future criminal activity,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Pose a danger to the safety of himself or herself or to other  persons or to property, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Violate the conditions of his or her release from immigration  custody pending removal from the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Travel documents and docket control for aliens continued in  detention--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Removal period. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The removal period for an alien  subject to a final order of removal shall begin on the latest of the  following dates:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> the date the order becomes administratively final;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the removal order is subject to judicial review (including  review by habeas corpus) and if the court has ordered a stay of the  alien's removal, the date on which, consistent with the court's order,  the removal order can be executed and the alien removed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the alien was detained or confined, except in connection with  a proceeding under this chapter relating to removability, the date the  alien is released from the detention or confinement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The removal period shall run for a period of 90 days. However,  the removal period is extended under section 241(a)(1)(C) of the Act if  the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for  travel or other documents necessary to the alien's departure or  conspires or acts to prevent the alien's removal subject to an order of  removal. The Service will provide such an alien with a Notice of Failure  to Comply, as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, before the  expiration of the removal period. The removal period shall be extended  until the alien demonstrates to the Service that he or she has complied  with the statutory obligations. Once the alien has complied with his or  her obligations under the law, the Service shall have a reasonable  period of time in order to effect the alien's removal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In general. The district director shall continue to undertake  appropriate steps to secure travel documents for the alien both before  and after the expiration of the removal period. If the district director  is unable to secure travel documents within the removal period, he or  she shall apply for assistance from Headquarters Detention and  Deportation, Office of Field Operations. The district director shall  promptly advise the HQPDU Director when travel documents are obtained  for an alien whose custody is subject to review by the HQPDU. The  Service's determination that receipt of a travel document is likely may  by itself warrant continuation of detention pending the removal of the  alien from the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Availability of travel document. In making a custody  determination, the district director and the Director of the HQPDU shall  consider the ability to obtain a travel document for the alien. If it is  established at any stage of a custody review that, in the judgment of  the Service, travel documents can be obtained, or such document is  forthcoming, the alien will not be released unless immediate removal is  not practicable or in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Removal. The Service will not conduct a custody review under  these procedures when the Service notifies the alien that it is ready to  execute an order of removal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Alien's compliance and cooperation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Release will be denied  and the alien may remain in detention if the alien fails or refuses to  make timely application in good faith for travel documents necessary to  the alien's departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's  removal. The detention provisions of section 241(a)(2) of the Act will  continue to apply, including provisions that mandate detention of  certain criminal and terrorist aliens.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Service shall serve the alien with a Notice of Failure to  Comply, which shall advise the alien of the following: the provisions of  sections 241(a)(1)(C) (extension of removal period) and 243(a) of the  Act (criminal penalties related to removal); the circumstances  demonstrating his or her failure to comply with the requirements of  section 241(a)(1)(C) of the Act; and an explanation of the necessary  steps that the alien must take in order   to comply with the statutory requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Service shall advise the alien that the Notice of Failure  to Comply shall have the effect of extending the removal period as  provided by law, if the removal period has not yet expired, and that the  Service is not obligated to complete its scheduled custody reviews under  this section until the alien has demonstrated compliance with the  statutory obligations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The fact that the Service does not provide a Notice of Failure  to Comply, within the 90-day removal period, to an alien who has failed  to comply with the requirements of section 241(a)(1)(C) of the Act,  shall not have the effect of excusing the alien's conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> District director's or Director of the Detention and Removal  Field Office's custody review procedures. The district director's or  Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office's custody  determination will be developed in accordance with the following  procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this  section, the district director or Director of the Detention and Removal  Field Office will conduct a records review prior to the expiration of  the removal period. This initial post-order custody review will consist  of a review of the alien's records and any written information submitted  in English to the district director by or on behalf of the alien.  However, the district director or Director of the Detention and Removal  Field Office may in his or her discretion schedule a personal or  telephonic interview with the alien as part of this custody  determination. The district director or Director of the Detention and  Removal Field Office may also consider any other relevant information  relating to the alien or his or her circumstances and custody status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notice to alien. The district director or Director of the  Detention and Removal Field Office will provide written notice to the  detainee approximately 30 days in advance of the pending records review  so that the alien may submit information in writing in support of his or  her release. The alien may be assisted by a person of his or her choice,  subject to reasonable security concerns at the institution and panel's  discretion, in preparing or submitting information in response to the  district director's notice. Such assistance shall be at no expense to  the Government. If the alien or his or her representative requests  additional time to prepare materials beyond the time when the district  director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office expects  to conduct the records review, such a request will constitute a waiver  of the requirement that the review occur prior to the expiration of the  removal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Factors for consideration. The district director's or Director  of the Detention and Removal Field Office's review will include but is  not limited to consideration of the factors described in paragraph (f)  of this section. Before making any decision to release a detainee, the  district director must be able to reach the conclusions set forth in  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> District director's or Director of the Detention and Removal  Field Office's decision. The district director or Director of the  Detention and Removal Field Office will notify the alien in writing that  he or she is to be released from custody, or that he or she will be  continued in detention pending removal or further review of his or her  custody status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> District office or Detention and Removal Field office staff. The  district director or the Director of the Detention and Removal Field  Office may delegate the authority to conduct the custody review, develop  recommendations, or render the custody or release decisions to those  persons directly responsible for detention within his or her  geographical areas of responsibility. This includes the deputy district  director, the assistant director for detention and deportation, the  officer-in-charge of a detention center, the assistant director of the  detention and removal field office, the director of the detention and  removal resident office, the assistant director of the detention and  removal resident office, officers in charge of service processing  centers, or such   other persons as the district director or the Director of the Detention  and Removal Field Office may designate from the professional staff of  the Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Determinations by the Executive Associate Commissioner.  Determinations by the Executive Associate Commissioner to release or  retain custody of aliens shall be developed in accordance with the  following procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review panels. The HQPDU Director shall designate a panel or  panels to make recommendations to the Executive Associate Commissioner.  A Review Panel shall, except as otherwise provided, consist of two  persons. Members of a Review Panel shall be selected from the  professional staff of the Service. All recommendations by the two-member  Review Panel shall be unanimous. If the vote of the two-member Review  Panel is split, it shall adjourn its deliberations concerning that  particular detainee until a third Review Panel member is added. The  third member of any Review Panel shall be the Director of the HQPDU or  his or her designee. A recommendation by a three-member Review Panel  shall be by majority vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records review. Initially, and at the beginning of each  subsequent review, the HQPDU Director or a Review Panel shall review the  alien's records. Upon completion of this records review, the HQPDU  Director or the Review Panel may issue a written recommendation that the  alien be released and reasons therefore.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Personal interview. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the HQPDU Director does not accept a  panel's recommendation to grant release after a records review, or if  the alien is not recommended for release, a Review Panel shall  personally interview the detainee. The scheduling of such interviews  shall be at the discretion of the HQPDU Director. The HQPDU Director  will provide a translator if he or she determines that such assistance  is appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien may be accompanied during the interview by a person  of his or her choice, subject to reasonable security concerns at the  institution's and panel's discretion, who is able to attend at the time  of the scheduled interview. Such assistance shall be at no expense to  the Government. The alien may submit to the Review Panel any  information, in English, that he or she believes presents a basis for  his or her release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alien's participation. Every alien shall respond to questions or  provide other information when requested to do so by Service officials  for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Panel recommendation. Following completion of the interview and  its deliberations, the Review Panel shall issue a written recommendation  that the alien be released or remain in custody pending removal or  further review. This written recommendation shall include a brief  statement of the factors that the Review Panel deems material to its  recommendation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Determination. The Executive Associate Commissioner shall  consider the recommendation and appropriate custody review materials and  issue a custody determination, in the exercise of discretion under the  standards of this section. The Executive Associate Commissioner's review  will include but is not limited to consideration of the factors  described in paragraph (f) of this section. Before making any decision  to release a detainee, the Executive Associate Commissioner must be able  to reach the conclusions set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The  Executive Associate Commissioner is not bound by the panel's  recommendation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> No significant likelihood or removal. During the custody review  process as provided in this paragraph (i), or at the conclusion of that  review, if the alien submits, or the record contains, information  providing a substantial reason to believe that the removal of a detained  alien is not significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future,  the HQPDU shall treat that as a request for review and initiate the  review procedures under Sec. 241.13. To the extent relevant, the HQPDU  may consider any information developed during the custody review process  under this section in connection with the determinations to be made by  the Service under Sec. 241.13. The Service shall complete the custody  review under this section unless the HQPDU is able to make a prompt  determination to release the   alien under an order of supervision under Sec. 241.13 because there is  no significant likelihood that the alien will be removed in the  reasonably foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Conditions of release--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The district director,  Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office, or Executive  Associate Commissioner shall impose such conditions or special  conditions on release as the Service considers appropriate in an  individual case or cases, including but not limited to the conditions of  release noted in 8 CFR 212.5(c) and Sec. 241.5. An alien released under  this section must abide by the release conditions specified by the  Service in relation to his or her release or sponsorship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sponsorship. The district director, Director of the Detention  and Removal Field Office, or Executive Associate Commissioner may, in  the exercise of discretion, condition release on placement with a close  relative who agrees to act as a sponsor, such as a parent, spouse,  child, or sibling who is a lawful permanent resident or a citizen of the  United States, or may condition release on the alien's placement or  participation in an approved halfway house, mental health project, or  community project when, in the opinion of the Service, such condition is  warranted. No detainee may be released until sponsorship, housing, or  other placement has been found for the detainee, if ordered, including  but not limited to, evidence of financial support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employment authorization. The district director, Director of the  Detention and Removal Field Office, and the Executive Associate  Commissioner, may, in the exercise of discretion, grant employment  authorization under the same conditions set forth in Sec. 241.5(c) for  aliens released under an order of supervision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withdrawal of release approval. The district director, Director  of the Detention and Removal Field Office, or Executive Associate  Commissioner may, in the exercise of discretion, withdraw approval for  release of any detained alien prior to release when, in the decision- maker's opinion, the conduct of the detainee, or any other circumstance,  indicates that release would no longer be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Timing of reviews. The timing of reviews shall be in accordance  with the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> District director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field  Office. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to the expiration of the removal period, the district  director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office shall  conduct a custody review for an alien described in paragraphs (a) and  (b)(1) of this section where the alien's removal, while proper, cannot  be accomplished during the period, or is impracticable or contrary to  the public interest. As provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section,  the district director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field  Office will notify the alien in writing that he or she is to be released  from custody, or that he or she will be continued in detention pending  removal or further review of his or her custody status.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When release is denied pending the alien's removal, the  district director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office  in his or her discretion may retain responsibility for custody  determinations for up to three months after expiration of the removal  period, during which time the district director or Director of the  Detention and Removal Field Office may conduct such additional review of  the case as he or she deems appropriate. The district director may  release the alien if he or she is not removed within the three-month  period following the expiration of the removal period, in accordance  with paragraphs (e), (f), and (j) of this section, or the district  director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office may refer  the alien to the HQPDU for further custody review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HQPDU reviews--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> District director or Director of the  Detention and Removal Field Office referral for further review. When the  district director or Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office  refers a case to the HQPDU for further review, as provided in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, authority over the custody determination  transfers to the Executive Associate Commissioner, according to  procedures established by the HQPDU. The Service will provide the alien  with approximately 30 days   notice of this further review, which will ordinarily be conducted by the  expiration of the removal period or as soon thereafter as practicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> District director or Director of the Detention and Removal  Field Office retains jurisdiction. When the district director or  Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office has advised the alien  at the 90-day review as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section  that he or she will remain in custody pending removal or further custody  review, and the alien is not removed within three months of the district  director's decision, authority over the custody determination transfers  from the district director or Director of the Detention and Removal  Field Office to the Executive Associate Commissioner. The initial HQPDU  review will ordinarily be conducted at the expiration of the three-month  period after the 90-day review or as soon thereafter as practicable. The  Service will provide the alien with approximately 30 days notice of that  review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Continued detention cases. A subsequent review shall  ordinarily be commenced for any detainee within approximately one year  of a decision by the Executive Associate Commissioner declining to grant  release. Not more than once every three months in the interim between  annual reviews, the alien may submit a written request to the HQPDU for  release consideration based on a proper showing of a material change in  circumstances since the last annual review. The HQPDU shall respond to  the alien's request in writing within approximately 90 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Review scheduling. Reviews will be conducted within the time  periods specified in paragraphs (k)(1)(i), (k)(2)(i), (k)(2)(ii), and  (k)(2)(iii) of this section or as soon as possible thereafter, allowing  for any unforeseen circumstances or emergent situation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Discretionary reviews. The HQPDU Director, in his or her  discretion, may schedule a review of a detainee at shorter intervals  when he or she deems such review to be warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Postponement of review. In the case of an alien who is in the  custody of the Service, the district director or the HQPDU Director may,  in his or her discretion, suspend or postpone the custody review process  if such detainee's prompt removal is practicable and proper, or for  other good cause. The decision and reasons for the delay shall be  documented in the alien's custody review file or A file, as appropriate.  Reasonable care will be exercised to ensure that the alien's case is  reviewed once the reason for delay is remedied or if the alien is not  removed from the United States as anticipated at the time review was  suspended or postponed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transition provisions. (i) The provisions of this section apply  to cases that have already received the 90-day review. If the alien's  last review under the procedures set out in the Executive Associate  Commissioner memoranda entitled Detention Procedures for Aliens Whose  Immediate Repatriation is Not Possible or Practicable, February 3, 1999;  Supplemental Detention Procedures, April 30, 1999; Interim Changes and  Instructions for Conduct of Post-order Custody Reviews, August 6, 1999;  Review of Long-term Detainees, October 22, 1999, was a records review  and the alien remains in custody, the HQPDU will conduct a custody  review within six months of that review (Memoranda available at http:// www.ins.usdoj.gov). If the alien's last review included an interview,  the HQPDU review will be scheduled one year from the last review. These  reviews will be conducted pursuant to the procedures in paragraph </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of  this section, within the time periods specified in this paragraph or as  soon as possible thereafter, allowing for resource limitations,  unforeseen circumstances, or an emergent situation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any case pending before the Board on December 21, 2000 will be  completed by the Board. If the Board affirms the district director's  decision to continue the alien in detention, the next scheduled custody  review will be conducted one year after the Board's decision in  accordance with the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Revocation of release--(1) Violation of conditions of release.  Any alien described in paragraph (a) or (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section who has  been released under an order of supervision or other conditions of  release who violates the conditions of release may be returned to  custody.   Any such alien who violates the conditions of an order of supervision is  subject to the penalties described in section 243(b) of the Act. Upon  revocation, the alien will be notified of the reasons for revocation of  his or her release or parole. The alien will be afforded an initial  informal interview promptly after his or her return to Service custody  to afford the alien an opportunity to respond to the reasons for  revocation stated in the notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination by the Service. The Executive Associate  Commissioner shall have authority, in the exercise of discretion, to  revoke release and return to Service custody an alien previously  approved for release under the procedures in this section. A district  director may also revoke release of an alien when, in the district  director's opinion, revocation is in the public interest and  circumstances do not reasonably permit referral of the case to the  Executive Associate Commissioner. Release may be revoked in the exercise  of discretion when, in the opinion of the revoking official:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The purposes of release have been served;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien violates any condition of release;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is appropriate to enforce a removal order or to commence  removal proceedings against an alien; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The conduct of the alien, or any other circumstance, indicates  that release would no longer be appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Timing of review when release is revoked. If the alien is not  released from custody following the informal interview provided for in  paragraph (l)(1) of this section, the HQPDU Director shall schedule the  review process in the case of an alien whose previous release or parole  from immigration custody pursuant to a decision of either the district  director, Director of the Detention and Removal Field Office, or  Executive Associate Commissioner under the procedures in this section  has been or is subject to being revoked. The normal review process will  commence with notification to the alien of a records review and  scheduling of an interview, which will ordinarily be expected to occur  within approximately three months after release is revoked. That custody  review will include a final evaluation of any contested facts relevant  to the revocation and a determination whether the facts as determined  warrant revocation and further denial of release. Thereafter, custody  reviews will be conducted annually under the provisions of paragraphs  (i), (j), and (k) of this section.
