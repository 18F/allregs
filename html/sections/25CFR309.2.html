                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Indian as applied to an individual means a person who is a  member of an Indian tribe or for purposes of this part is certified by  an Indian tribe as a non-member Indian artisan (in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 309.4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Indian artisan means an individual who is certified by an Indian  tribe as a non-member Indian artisan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Indian arts and crafts organization means any legally  established arts and crafts marketing organization composed of members  of Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Indian product--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``Indian product''  means any art or craft product made by an Indian. For this purpose, the  term ``made by an Indian'' means that an Indian has provided the  artistic or craft work labor necessary to implement an artistic design  through a substantial transformation of materials to produce the art or  craft work. This may include more than one Indian working together. The  labor component of the product, however, must be entirely Indian for the  Indian art or craft object to be an ``Indian product.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Illustrations. The term ``Indian product'' includes, but is not  limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Art made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non- traditional style or medium;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Craft work made by an Indian that is in a traditional or non- traditional style or medium;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Handcraft made by an Indian, i.e. an object created with the  help of only such devices as allow the manual skill of the maker to  condition the shape and design of each individual product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of non-qualifying products. An ``Indian product'' under  the Act does not include any of the following, for example:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product made by  non-Indian labor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that  is designed by an Indian but produced by non-Indian labor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that  is assembled from a kit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product  originating from a commercial product, without substantial  transformation provided by Indian artistic or craft work labor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Industrial products, which for this purpose are defined as goods  that have an exclusively functional purpose, do not serve as a  traditional artistic medium, and that do not lend themselves to Indian  embellishment, such as appliances and vehicles. An industrial product  may not become an Indian product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A product in the style of an Indian art or craft product that  is produced in an assembly line or related production line process using  multiple workers not all whom are Indians. For example, if twenty people  make up the labor to create the product(s), and one person is not  Indian, the product is not an ``Indian product.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Indian tribe means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any  organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the  special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians  because of their status as Indians; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian  tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar  organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Product of a particular Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts  organization means that the origin of a product is identified as a named  Indian tribe or   named Indian arts and crafts organization.
