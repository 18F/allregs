This must be shown at any speed that can be obtained, except that speeds requiring a control force in excess of 40 pounds or speeds above the maximum allowable speed or below the minimum speed for steady unstalled flight, need not be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The airspeed must return to within the tolerances specified for applicable categories of airplanes when the control force is slowly released at any speed within the speed range specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The applicable tolerances are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The airspeed must return to within plus or minus 10 percent of the original trim airspeed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For commuter category airplanes, the airspeed must return to within plus or minus 7.5 percent of the original trim airspeed for the cruising condition specified in Sec. 23.175(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The stick force must vary with speed so that any substantial speed change results in a stick force clearly perceptible to the pilot.
