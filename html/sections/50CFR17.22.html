                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may issue a permit authorizing any activity otherwise prohibited by Sec. 17.21, in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section, for scientific purposes, for enhancing the propagation or survival, or for the incidental taking of endangered wildlife. Such permits may authorize a single transaction, a series of transactions, or a number of activities over a specific period of time. (See Sec. 17.32 for permits for threatened species.) The Director shall publish notice in the Federal Register of each application for a permit that is made under this section. Each notice shall invite the submission from interested parties, within 30 days after the date of the notice, of written data, views, or arguments with respect to the application. The 30-day period may be waived by the Director in an emergency situation where the life or health of an endangered animal is threatened and no reasonable alternative is available to the applicant. Notice of any such waiver shall be published in the Federal Register within 10 days following issuance of the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> Application requirements for permits for scientific purposes or for the enhancement of propagation or survival. A person wishing to get a permit for an activity prohibited by Sec. 17.21 submits an application for activities under this paragraph.

The duration of permits issued under this paragraph shall be sufficient to provide adequate assurances to the permittee to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by the permit, including conservation activities and land use restrictions. In determining the duration of a permit, the Director shall consider the duration of the planned activities, as well as the possible positive and negative effects associated with permits of the proposed duration on listed species, including the extent to which the conservation plan will enhance the habitat of listed species and increase the long-term survivability of such species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (b)(5) apply only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section where the conservation plan is being properly implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take permits issued prior to March 25, 1998 remain in effect, and those permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures specified in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for in the plan's operating conservation program, the Director will not require any conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those provided for in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided the plan is being properly implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unforeseen circumstances. (A) In negotiating unforeseen circumstances, the Director will not require the commitment of additional land, water, or financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, water, or other natural resources beyond the

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 13.26 of this subchapter, a permittee under this paragraph (b) remains responsible for any outstanding minimization and mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that occurs prior to surrender of the permit and such minimization and mitigation measures as may be required pursuant to the termination provisions of an implementing agreement, habitat conservation plan, or permit even after surrendering the permit to the Service pursuant to Sec. 13.26 of this subchapter. The permit shall be deemed canceled only upon a determination by the Service that such minimization and mitigation measures have been implemented. Upon surrender of the permit, no further take shall be authorized under the terms of the surrendered permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Criteria for revocation. A permit issued under paragraph (b) of this section may not be revoked for any reason except those set forth in Sec. 13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter or unless continuation of the permitted activity would be inconsistent with the criterion set forth in 16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(2)(B)(iv) and the inconsistency has not been remedied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of survival through Safe Harbor Agreements. The applicant must submit an application for a permit under this paragraph (c) to the appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Region where the applicant resides or where the proposed activity is to occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22), if the applicant wishes to engage in any activity prohibited by Sec. 17.21. The applicant must submit an official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of survival through Safe Harbor Agreements.

In addition to any applicable general permit conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this paragraph (c) is subject to the following special conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A requirement for the participating property owner to notify the Service of any transfer of lands subject to a Safe Harbor Agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When appropriate, a requirement for the permittee to give the Service reasonable advance notice (generally at least 30 days) of when he or she expects to incidentally take any listed species covered under the permit. Such notification will provide the Service with an opportunity to relocate affected individuals of the species, if possible and appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any additional requirements or conditions the Director deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the permit and the Safe Harbor Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Permit effective date. Permits issued under this paragraph (c) become effective the day of issuance for species covered by the Safe Harbor Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assurances provided to permittee. (i) The assurances in paragraph (c)(5) (ii) of this section (c)(5) apply only to Safe Harbor permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section where the Safe Harbor Agreement is being properly implemented, and apply only with respect to species covered by the Agreement and permit.

However, the Director may not require additional or different management activities to be undertaken by a permittee without the consent of the permittee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Additional actions. Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the Director, any Federal, State, local or Tribal government agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions at its own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a Safe Harbor Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Criteria for revocation. The Director may not revoke a permit issued under paragraph (c) of this section except as provided in this paragraph. The Director may revoke a permit for any reason set forth in Sec. 13.28(a)(1) through (4) of this subchapter. The Director

may revoke a permit if continuation of the permitted activity would either appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild of any listed species or directly or indirectly alter designated critical habitat such that it appreciably diminishes the value of that critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Before revoking a permit for either of the latter two reasons, the Director, with the consent of the permittee, will pursue all appropriate options to avoid permit revocation. These options may include, but are not limited to: extending or modifying the existing permit, capturing and relocating the species, compensating the landowner to forgo the activity, purchasing an easement or fee simple interest in the property, or arranging for a third-party acquisition of an interest in the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this paragraph (c) must be sufficient to provide a net conservation benefit to species covered in the enhancement of survival permit. In determining the duration of a permit, the Director will consider the duration of the planned activities, as well as the positive and negative effects associated with permits of the proposed duration on covered species, including the extent to which the conservation activities included in the Safe Harbor Agreement will enhance the survival and contribute to the recovery of listed species included in the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of survival through Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances. The applicant must submit an application for a permit under this paragraph (d) to the appropriate Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Region where the applicant resides or where the proposed activity is to occur (for appropriate addresses, see 50 CFR 10.22). When a species covered by a Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances is listed as endangered and the applicant wishes to engage in activities identified in the Agreement and otherwise prohibited by Sec. 17.31, the applicant must apply for an enhancement of survival permit for species covered by the Agreement. The permit will become valid if and when covered proposed, candidate or other unlisted species is listed as an endangered species. The applicant must submit an official Service application form (3-200.54) that includes the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application requirements for permits for the enhancement of survival through Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances.

The duration of a Candidate Conservation Agreement covered by a permit issued under this paragraph (d) must be sufficient to enable the Director to determine that the benefits of the conservation measures in the Agreement, when combined with those benefits that would be achieved if it is assumed that the conservation measures would also be implemented on other necessary properties, would preclude or remove any need to list the species covered by the Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Objection to permit issuance. (1) In regard to any notice of a permit application published in the Federal Register, any interested party that objects to the issuance of a permit, in whole or in part, may, during the comment period specified in the notice, request notification of the final action to be taken on the application. A separate written request shall be made for each permit application. Such a request shall specify the Service's permit application number and state the reasons why that party believes the applicant does not meet the issuance criteria contained in Sec. Sec. 13.21 and 17.22 of this subchapter or other reasons why the permit should not be issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In regard to any notice of a permit application published in the Federal Register, any interested party that objects to the issuance of a permit, in whole or in part, may, during the comment period specified in the notice, request notification of the final action to be taken on the application.
