                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Property that is acquired or improved, in whole or in part, with Investment Assistance shall be held in trust by the Recipient for the benefit of the Project for the Estimated Useful Life of the Project, during which period EDA retains an undivided equitable reversionary interest in the Property (the ``Federal Interest''). The Federal Interest secures compliance with matters such as the purpose, scope and use of a Project and is often reflected by a recorded lien, statement or other recordable instrument setting forth EDA's Property interest in a Project (e.g., a mortgage, covenant, or other statement of EDA's Real Property interest in the case of a Project involving the acquisition, construction or improvement of a building. See Sec. 314.8.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Federal government is fully compensated for the Federal Share of Property acquired or improved, in whole or in part, with Investment Assistance, the Federal Interest is extinguished and the Federal government has no further interest in the Property.</p>
