                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As used in this subpart, ``sensitive information'' refers to  information that the contractor has developed at private expense or that  the Government has generated that qualifies for an exception to the  Freedom of Information Act, which is not currently in the public domain,  may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and may  be sensitive or privileged, the disclosure of which is likely to have  either of the following effects: To impair the Government's ability to  obtain this type of information in the future; or to cause substantial  harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information  was obtained. The term is not intended to resemble the markings of  national security documents as in sensitive-secret-top secret.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in this subpart, ``requiring organization'' refers to  the NASA organizational element or activity that requires specified  services to be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As used in this subpart, ``service provider'' refers to the  service contractor that receives sensitive information from NASA to  provide services to the requiring organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To support management activities and administrative  functions, NASA relies on numerous service providers. These contractors  may require access to sensitive information in the Government's  possession, which may be entitled to protection from unauthorized use or  disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an initial step, the requiring organization shall identify  when needed services may entail access to sensitive information and  shall determine whether providing access is necessary for accomplishing  the Agency's mission. The requiring organization shall review any  service provider requests for access to information to determine whether  the access is necessary and whether the information requested is  considered ``sensitive'' as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the requiring organization determines that providing  specified services will entail access to sensitive information, the  solicitation shall require each potential service provider to submit  with its proposal a preliminary analysis of possible organizational  conflicts of interest that might flow from the award of a contract.  After selection, or whenever it becomes clear that performance will  necessitate access to sensitive information, the service provider must  submit a comprehensive organizational conflicts of interest avoidance  plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This comprehensive plan shall incorporate any previous studies  performed, shall thoroughly analyze all organizational conflicts of  interest that might arise because the service provider has access to  other companies'   sensitive information, and shall establish specific methods to control,  mitigate, or eliminate all problems identified. The contracting officer,  with advice from Center counsel, shall review the plan for completeness  and identify to the service provider substantive weaknesses and  omissions for necessary correction. Once the service provider has  corrected the substantive weaknesses and omissions, the contracting  officer shall incorporate the revised plan into the contract, as a  compliance document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the service provider will be operating an information  technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the  operating contract shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security  Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, which  requires the implementation of an Information Technology Security Plan  to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from  unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> NASA will monitor performance to assure any service provider  that requires access to sensitive information follows the steps outlined  in the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information, to  protect the information from unauthorized use or disclosure.</p>
