                            <p class="depth0">Section 547 provides a method under which, by virtue of dividend  distributions, a corporation may be relieved from the payment of a  deficiency in the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541  (or by a corresponding provision of a prior income tax law), or may be  entitled to a credit or refund of a part or all of any such deficiency  which has been paid. The method provided by section 547 is to allow an  additional deduction for a dividend distribution (which meets the  requirements of this section) in computing undistributed personal  holding company income for the taxable year for which a deficiency in  personal holding company tax is determined. The additional deduction for  deficiency dividends will not, however, be allowed for the purpose of  determining interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties,  computed with respect to the personal holding company tax prior to the  allowance of the additional deduction for deficiency dividends. Such  amounts remain payable as if section 547 had not been enacted.</p>
