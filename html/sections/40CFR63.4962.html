                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Following the initial compliance period, you must complete a compliance demonstration according to the requirements in Sec. 63.4961(m) for each subsequent compliance period. Each month following the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4960 is a compliance period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the organic HAP emission rate for any compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4890, this is a deviation from the emission limitation for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4910(c)(6) and 63.4920(a)(7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each operating limit required by Sec. 63.4892 that applies to you, as specified in Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an operating parameter is out of the allowed range specified in Table 1 to this subpart, this is a deviation from the operating limit that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4910(c)(6) and 63.4920(a)(7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an operating parameter deviates from the operating limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart, then you must assume that the emission capture system and add-on control device were achieving zero efficiency during the time period of the deviation. For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations specified in Sec. 63.4961, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation, as indicated in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4961.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must meet the requirements for bypass lines in Sec. 63.4967(b) for controlled coating operations for which you do not conduct liquid-liquid material balances. If any bypass line is opened and emissions are diverted to the atmosphere when the coating operation is running, this is a deviation that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4910(c)(6) and 63.4920(a)(7). For the purposes of completing the compliance calculations in Sec. 63.4961, you must treat the materials used during a deviation on a controlled coating operation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation, as indicated in Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4961.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards in Sec. 63.4893. If you did not develop a work practice plan, or you did not implement the plan, or you did not keep the records required by Sec. 63.4930(k)(8), this is a deviation from the work practice standards that must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4910(c)(6) and 63.4920(a)(7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As part of each semiannual compliance report required in Sec. 63.4920, you must identify the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, submit an affirmative statement that you were in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4890, and you achieved the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4892 and the work practice standards required by Sec. 63.4893 during each compliance period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)-(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must maintain records as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4930 and 63.4931.
