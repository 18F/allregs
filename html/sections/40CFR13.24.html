                            <p class="depth0">EPA may compromise claims for money or property where the claim,  exclusive of interest, penalty and administrative costs, does not exceed  $20,000. Where the claim exceeds $20,000, the authority to accept the  compromise rests solely with DOJ. The Administrator may reject an offer  of compromise in any amount. Where the claim exceeds $20,000 and EPA  recommends acceptance of a compromise offer, it will refer the claim  with its   recommendation to DOJ for approval. The referral will be in the form of  the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) and will outline the  basis for EPA's recommendation. EPA refers compromise offers for claims  in excess of $100,000 to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil  Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, unless otherwise  provided by Department of Justice delegations or procedures. EPA refers  offers of compromise for claims of $20,000 to $100,000 to the United  States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. If  the Administrator has a debtor's firm written offer for compromise which  is substantial in amount but the Administrator is uncertain as to  whether the offer should be accepted, he may refer the offer and the  supporting data to DOJ or GAO for action.</p>
