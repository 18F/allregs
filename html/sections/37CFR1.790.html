                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An owner of record of a patent or its agent who reasonably expects that the applicable regulatory review period described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(ii), (3)(B)(ii), (4)(B)(ii), or (5)(B)(ii) of subsection (g) that began for a product that is the subject of such patent may extend beyond the expiration of the patent term in effect may submit one or more applications for interim extensions for periods of up to one year each. The initial application for interim extension must be filed during the period beginning 6 months and ending 15 days before the patent term is due to expire. Each subsequent application for interim extension must be filed during the period beginning 60 days before and ending 30 days before the expiration of the preceding interim extension. In no event will the interim extensions granted under this section be longer than the maximum period of extension to which the applicant would be entitled under 35 U.S.C. 156(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A complete application for interim extension under this section shall include all of the information required for a formal application under Sec.  1.740 and a complete application under Sec.  1.741. Sections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6)-(a)(17) of Sec.  1.740 and Sec.  1.741 shall be read in the context of a product currently undergoing regulatory review. Sections (a)(3) and (a)(5) of Sec.  1.740 are not applicable to an application for interim extension under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The content of each subsequent interim extension application may be limited to a request for a subsequent interim extension along with a statement that the regulatory review period has not been completed along with any materials or information required under Sec. Sec.  1.740 and 1.741 that are not present in the preceding interim extension application.
