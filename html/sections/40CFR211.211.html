A specific category  is considered when the attenuation value at the tested one-third octave  band is equal to or greater than the Labeled Value, or mean attenuation  value, stated in the supporting information required by Sec. 211.204-4,  for that tested frequency. The attenuation value must be determined  according to the test procedures of Sec. 211.206. The Noise Reduction  Rating for the label must be calculated using the Labeled Values of mean  attenuation that will be included in the supporting information required  by Sec. 211.204-4.
