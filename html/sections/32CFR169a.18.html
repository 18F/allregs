The procedure does not authorize an appeal outside the DoD Component or a judicial review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appeals procedure shall be independent and objective and provide for a decision on the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. The decision shall be made by an impartial official at a level organizationally higher than the official who approved the cost comparison decision. The appeal decision shall be final, unless the DoD Component procedures provide for further discretionary review within the DoD Component.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All detailed documentation supporting the initial cost comparison decision shall be made available to directly affected parties upon request when the initial decision is announced. The detailed documentation shall include, at a minimum, the following: the in-house cost estimate with detailed supporting documentation (see Sec. 169a.5(c)(ii) of this part), the completed CCF, name of the tentative winning contractor (if the decision is to contract), or the price of the bidder whose bid or proposal would have been most advantageous to the Government (if the decision is to perform in-house).

(1) Directly affected parties may appeal decision to convert to contract based on a simplified cost comparison involving 11-45 DoD civilian employees or a direct conversion involving 10 or fewer DoD civilian employees.
