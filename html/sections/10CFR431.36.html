                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. A manufacturer or private labeler shall not distribute in commerce any basic model of an electric motor which is subject to an energy efficiency standard set forth in this subpart unless it has submitted to the Department a Compliance Certification certifying, in accordance with

the provisions of this section, that the basic model meets the requirements of the applicable standard. The representations in the Compliance Certification must be based upon the basic model's energy efficiency as determined in accordance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. This means, in part, that either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The representations as to the basic model must be based on use of a certification organization; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any testing of the basic model on which the representations are based must be conducted at an accredited laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Required contents--(1) General representations. Each Compliance Certification must certify that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General representations. Each Compliance Certification must certify that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The nominal full load efficiency for each basic model of electric motor distributed is not less than the minimum nominal full load efficiency required for that motor by Sec. 431.25;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All required determinations on which the Compliance Certification is based were made in compliance with the applicable requirements prescribed in this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All information reported in the Compliance Certification is true, accurate, and complete; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The manufacturer or private labeler is aware of the penalties associated with violations of the Act and the regulations thereunder, and of 18 U.S.C. 1001 which prohibits knowingly making false statements to the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specific data. (i) For each rating of electric motor (as the term ``rating'' is defined in the definition of basic model) which a manufacturer or private labeler distributes, the Compliance Certification must report the nominal full load efficiency, determined pursuant to Sec. Sec. 431.16 and 431.17, of the least efficient basic model within that rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each rating of electric motor (as the term ``rating'' is defined in the definition of basic model) which a manufacturer or private labeler distributes, the Compliance Certification must report the nominal full load efficiency, determined pursuant to Sec.

In any Compliance Certification, a manufacturer or private labeler may at its option request that DOE provide it with a unique Compliance Certification number (``CC number'') for any brand name, trademark or other label name under which the manufacturer or private labeler distributes electric motors covered by the Certification. Such a Compliance Certification must also identify all other names, if any, under which the manufacturer or private labeler distributes electric motors, and to which the request does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Signature and submission. A manufacturer or private labeler must submit the Compliance Certification either on its own behalf, signed by a corporate official of the company, or through a third party (for example, a trade association or other authorized representative) acting on its behalf. Where a third party is used, the Compliance Certification must identify the official of the manufacturer or private labeler who authorized the third party to make representations on the company's behalf, and must be signed by a corporate official of the third party. The Compliance Certification must be submitted to the Department electronically at https://www.regulations.doe.gov/ccms. Alternatively, the Compliance Certification may be submitted by certified mail to: Certification and Compliance Reports, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Program, EE-2J, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> New basic models. For electric motors, a Compliance Certification must be submitted for a new basic model only if the manufacturer or private labeler has not previously submitted to DOE a Compliance Certification, that meets the requirements of this section, for a basic model that has the same rating as the new basic model, and that has a lower nominal full load efficiency than the new basic model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Response to Compliance Certification; Compliance Certification Number (CC number)--(1) DOE processing of Certification. Promptly upon receipt of a Compliance Certification, the Department will determine whether the document contains all of the elements required by this section, and may, in its

discretion, determine whether all or part of the information provided in the document is accurate. The Department will then advise the submitting party in writing either that the Compliance Certification does not satisfy the requirements of this section, in which case the document will be returned, or that the Compliance Certification satisfies this section. The Department will also advise the submitting party of the basis for its determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DOE processing of Certification.

Any representations made with respect to the energy use or efficiency of such electric motors must be in accordance with whichever version is selected. Given that after June 11, 2014 representations with respect to the energy use or efficiency of electric motors must be made in accordance with tests conducted pursuant to this appendix, manufacturers may wish to begin using this test procedure as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0">For any other electric motor type that is not currently covered by the energy conservation standards at 10 CFR 431.25, manufacturers of this equipment will need to use Appendix B 180 days after the effective date of the final rule adopting energy conservation standards for these motors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Definitions contained in Sec. Sec. 431.2 and 431.12 are applicable to this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2. Test Procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Efficiency and losses shall be determined in accordance with NEMA MG1-2009, paragraph 12.58.1, ``Determination of Motor Efficiency and Losses,'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15) and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CSA C390-10, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> IEEE Std 112-2004 Test Method B, Input-Output With Loss Segregation, (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15).</p><p class="depth0">3.

Procedures for the Testing of Certain Electric Motor Types.</p><p class="depth0">Prior to testing according to IEEE Std 112-2004 (Test Method B) or CSA C390-10 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.15), each basic model of the electric motor types listed below must be set up in accordance with the instructions of this section to ensure consistent test results. These steps are designed to enable a motor to be attached to a dynamometer and run continuously for testing purposes. For the purposes of this appendix, a ``standard bearing'' is a 6000 series, either open or grease-lubricated double-shielded, single-row, deep groove, radial ball bearing.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Brake Electric Motors:</p><p class="depth0">Brake electric motors shall be tested with the brake component powered separately from the motor such that it does not activate during testing. Additionally, for any 10-minute period during the test and while the brake is being powered such that it remains disengaged from the motor shaft, record the power consumed (i.e., watts). Only power used to drive the motor is to be included in the efficiency calculation; power supplied to prevent the brake from engaging is not included in this calculation. In lieu of powering the brake separately, the brake may be disengaged mechanically, if such a mechanism exists and if the use of this mechanism does not yield a different efficiency value than separately powering the brake electrically.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Close-Coupled Pump Electric Motors and Electric Motors with Single or Double Shaft Extensions of Non-Standard Dimensions or Design:</p><p class="depth0">To attach the unit under test to a dynamometer, close-coupled pump electric motors and electric motors with single or double shaft extensions of non-standard dimensions or design must be tested using a special coupling adapter.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Electric Motors with Non-Standard Endshields or Flanges:</p><p class="depth0">If it is not possible to connect the electric motor to a dynamometer with the non-standard endshield or flange in place, the testing laboratory shall replace the non-standard endshield or flange with an endshield or flange meeting NEMA or IEC specifications. The replacement component should be obtained from the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer chooses, machined by the testing laboratory after consulting with the manufacturer regarding the critical characteristics of the endshield.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Electric Motors with Non-Standard Bases, Feet or Mounting Configurations</p><p class="depth0">An electric motor with a non-standard base, feet, or mounting configuration may be mounted on the test equipment using adaptive fixtures for testing as long as the mounting or use of adaptive mounting fixtures does not have an adverse impact on the performance of the electric motor, particularly on the cooling of the motor.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Electric Motors with a Separately-powered Blower:</p><p class="depth0">For electric motors furnished with a separately-powered blower, the losses from the blower's motor should not be included in any efficiency calculation. This can be done either by powering the blower's motor by a source separate from the source powering the electric motor under test or by connecting leads such that they only measure the power of the motor under test.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 Immersible Electric Motors</p><p class="depth0">Immersible electric motors shall be tested with all contact seals removed but be otherwise unmodified.</p><p class="depth0">4.7 Partial Electric Motors:</p><p class="depth0">Partial electric motors shall be disconnected from their mated piece of equipment. After disconnection from the equipment, standard bearings and/or endshields shall be added to the motor, such that it is capable of operation. If an endshield is necessary, an endshield meeting NEMA or IEC specifications should be obtained from the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer chooses, machined by the testing laboratory after consulting with the manufacturer regarding the critical characteristics of the endshield.</p><p class="depth0">4.8 Vertical Electric Motors and Electric Motors with Bearings Incapable of Horizontal Operation:</p><p class="depth0">Vertical electric motors and electric motors with thrust bearings shall be tested in a horizontal or vertical configuration in accordance with IEEE 112 (Test Method B), depending on the testing facility's capabilities and construction of the motor, except if the motor is a vertical solid shaft normal thrust general purpose electric motor (subtype II), in which case it shall be tested in a horizontal configuration in accordance with IEEE 112 (Test Method B). Preference shall be given to testing a motor in its native orientation. If the unit under test cannot be reoriented horizontally due to its bearing construction, the electric motor's bearing(s) shall be removed and replaced with standard bearings. If the unit under test contains oil-

lubricated bearings, its bearings shall be removed and replaced with standard bearings. Finally, if the unit under test contains a hollow shaft, a solid shaft shall be inserted, bolted to the non-drive end of the motor and welded on the drive end. Enough clearance shall be maintained such that attachment to a dynamometer is possible.
