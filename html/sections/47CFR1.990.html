                            <p class="depth0">These rules establish the requirements and conditions for obtaining  the Commission's prior approval of foreign ownership in common carrier,  aeronautical en route, and aeronautical fixed radio station licensees  and common carrier spectrum lessees that would exceed the 25 percent  benchmark in section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, as  amended (47 U.S.C. 310(b)(4)). These rules also establish the  requirements and conditions for obtaining the Commission's prior  approval of foreign ownership in common carrier (but not aeronautical en  route or aeronautical fixed) radio station licensees and spectrum  lessees that would exceed the 20 percent limit in section 310(b)(3) of  the Act (47 U.S.C. 310(b)(3)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A common carrier, aeronautical en route or aeronautical fixed  radio station licensee or common carrier spectrum lessee shall file a  petition for declaratory ruling to obtain Commission approval under  section 310(b)(4) of the Act, and obtain such approval, before the  aggregate foreign ownership of any controlling, U.S.-organized parent  company exceeds, directly and/or indirectly, 25 percent of the U.S.  parent's equity interests and/or 25 percent of its voting interests. An  applicant for a common carrier, aeronautical en route or aeronautical  fixed radio station license or common carrier spectrum leasing  arrangement shall file the petition for declaratory ruling required by  this paragraph at the same time that it files its application.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a)(1):</p><p class="depth3">Paragraph (a)(1) of this section implements the Commission's foreign  ownership policies under section 310(b)(4) of the Act (47 U.S.C.  310(b)(4)), for common carrier, aeronautical en route, and aeronautical  fixed radio station licensees and common carrier spectrum lessees. It  applies to foreign equity and/or voting interests that are held, or  would be held, directly and/or indirectly in a U.S.-organized entity  that itself directly or indirectly controls a common carrier,  aeronautical en route, or aeronautical fixed radio station licensee or  common carrier spectrum lessee. A foreign individual or entity that  seeks to hold a controlling interest in such a licensee or spectrum  lessee must hold its controlling interest indirectly, in a U.S.- organized entity that itself directly or indirectly controls the  licensee or spectrum lessee. Such controlling interests are subject to  section 310(b)(4) and the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. The Commission assesses foreign ownership interests subject to  section 310(b)(4) separately from foreign ownership interests subject to  section 310(b)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A common carrier radio station licensee or spectrum lessee shall  file a petition for declaratory ruling to obtain approval under the  Commission's section 310(b)(3) forbearance approach, and obtain such  approval, before aggregate foreign ownership, held through one or more  intervening U.S.-organized entities that hold non-controlling equity  and/or voting interests in the licensee, along with any foreign  interests held directly in the licensee or spectrum lessee, exceeds 20  percent of its equity interests and/or 20 percent of its voting  interests. An applicant for a common carrier radio station license or  spectrum leasing arrangement shall file the petition for declaratory  ruling required by this paragraph at the same   time that it files its application. Foreign interests held directly in a  licensee or spectrum lessee, or other than through U.S.-organized  entities that hold non-controlling equity and/or voting interests in the  licensee or spectrum lessee, shall not be permitted to exceed 20  percent.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a)(2):</p><p class="depth3">Paragraph (a)(2) of this section implements the Commission's section  310(b)(3) forbearance approach adopted in the First Report and Order in  IB Docket No. 11-133, FCC 12-93 (released August 17, 2012), 77 FR 50628  (Aug. 22, 2012). The section 310(b)(3) forbearance approach applies only  to foreign equity and voting interests that are held, or would be held,  in a common carrier licensee or spectrum lessee through one or more  intervening U.S.-organized entities that do not control the licensee or  spectrum lessee. Foreign equity and/or voting interests that are held,  or would be held, directly in a licensee or spectrum lessee, or  indirectly other than through an intervening U.S.-organized entity, are  not subject to the Commission's section 310(b)(3) forbearance approach  and shall not be permitted to exceed the 20 percent limit in section  310(b)(3) of the Act (47 U.S.C. 310(b)(3)).</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. U.S.-organized Corporation A is preparing an application  to acquire a common carrier radio license by assignment from another  licensee. U.S.-organized Corporation A is wholly owned and controlled by  U.S.-organized Corporation B.

The  remaining non-controlling 49 percent equity and voting interests in  U.S.-organized Corporation B are held by U.S.-organized Corporation X,  which is, in turn, wholly owned and controlled by U.S. citizens.  Paragraph (a)(1) of this section requires that U.S.-organized  Corporation A file a petition for declaratory ruling to obtain  Commission approval of the 51 percent foreign ownership of its  controlling, U.S.-organized parent, Corporation B, by foreign-organized  Corporation D, which exceeds the 25 percent benchmark in section  310(b)(4) of the Act for both equity interests and voting interests.  Corporation A is also required to identify and request specific approval  in its petition for any foreign individual or entity, or ``group,'' as  defined in paragraph (d) of this section, that holds directly and/or  indirectly more than five percent of Corporation B's total outstanding  capital stock (equity) and/or voting stock, or a controlling interest in  Corporation B, unless the foreign investment is exempt under  Sec. 1.991(i)(3).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2.

The remaining non-controlling 49  percent equity and voting interests in U.S.-organized Corporation A are  held by U.S.-organized Corporation X, which is, in turn, wholly owned  and controlled by foreign-organized Corporation Y. Paragraph (a)(2) of  this section requires that U.S.-organized Corporation A file a petition  for declaratory ruling to obtain Commission approval of the non- controlling 49 percent foreign ownership of U.S.-organized Corporation A  by foreign-organized Corporation Y through U.S.-organized Corporation X,  which exceeds the 20 percent limit in section 310(b)(3) of the Act for  both equity interests and voting interests. U.S.-organized Corporation A  is also required to identify and request specific approval in its  petition for any foreign individual or entity, or ``group,'' as defined  in paragraph (d) of this section, that holds an equity and/or voting  interest in foreign-organized Corporation Y that, when multiplied by 49  percent, would exceed five percent of U.S.-organized Corporation A's  equity and/or voting interests, unless the foreign investment is exempt  under Sec. 1.991(i)(3).</p><p class="depth3">Example 3.

The remaining  non-controlling 49 percent equity and voting interests in U.S.-organized  Corporation A are held by U.S.-organized Corporation X, which is, in  turn, wholly owned and controlled by foreign-organized Corporation Y.  Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section require that U.S.-organized  Corporation A file a petition for declaratory ruling to obtain  Commission approval of foreign-organized Corporation C's 100 percent  ownership interest in U.S.-organized parent, Corporation B, and of  foreign-organized Corporation Y's non-controlling, 49 percent foreign  ownership interest in U.S.-organized Corporation A through U.S-organized  Corporation X, which exceed the 25 percent benchmark and 20 percent  limit in sections 310(b)(4) and 310(b)(3) of the Act, respectively, for  both equity interests and voting interests. U.S-organized Corporation  A's petition also must identify and request specific approval for  ownership interests held by any foreign individual, entity, or  ``group,'' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent  required by Sec. 1.991(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The petition for declaratory ruling required by paragraph (a) of  this   section shall be filed electronically on the Internet through the  International Bureau Filing System (IBFS).
