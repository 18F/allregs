                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to a benefit of a participant who becomes  reemployed after service in the uniformed services that is covered by  the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994  (USERRA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (c) (together with any  benefit earned for the period preceding military service) except for the  fact that the participant was not reemployed on or before the  termination date will be deemed to satisfy those requirements if PBGC  determines, based upon a demonstration by the participant or otherwise,  that he or she became reemployed after the termination date and entitled  to the benefit under USERRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> is a benefit  attributable to a period of service commencing before the termination  date and ending on the termination date during which the participant was  serving in the uniformed services as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303(13) (or  was in a subsequent reemployment eligibility period) and to which the  participant is entitled under USERRA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example: A plan's vesting requirement is 5 years of service with  the employer. A participant has completed 4 years of service when he  leaves employment for uniformed service. The plan terminates while the  participant is in military service. As of the termination date, the  participant would have had 5 years of service and 5 years of benefit  accruals if he had remained continuously employed. Upon reemployment  after the termination date but within the time limits set by USERRA, the  participant would have had 6 years of service under the plan for vesting  and benefit accrual purposes, if the plan had not terminated. PBGC would  treat the participant as having a vested, nonforfeitable plan benefit  with 5 years of vesting service and benefit accruals as of the  termination date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of a PPA 2006 bankruptcy termination, ``bankruptcy  filing date'' is substituted for ``termination date'' each place that  ``termination date'' appears in this section.
