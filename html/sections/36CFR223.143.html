A transcript of the informal hearing  shall not be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the  suspending official finds that there exists a genuine dispute over facts  material to the suspension, respondent(s) shall be afforded an  opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present  witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents, unless--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The action is based on an indictment; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice  advice, that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or  contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension  would be prejudiced.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If appropriate, the respondent may request a fact-finding  conference on disputed material facts. Such a conference shall be held  within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received unless  mutually agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall   conform with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the  suspending official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in  the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected  to by the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At the conference, the respondent shall have the opportunity to  appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and  confront any person the Forest Service presents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be  prepared and made available at cost to the respondent upon request,  unless the respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive  the requirement for a transcript.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Suspending official's decision.

In actions based on an  indictment, in which the respondent's submission does not raise a  genuine dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings  to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of  Department of Justice advice, the suspending official's decision shall  be based on all the information in the administrative record, including  any submissions and argument made by the respondent. The decision shall  be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and  argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official  extends this period for good cause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional proceedings necessary. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In actions in which  additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts,  written findings of fact shall be promptly prepared.

The suspending  official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after  specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly  erroneous.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The suspending official's decision shall be made only after the  conclusion of any proceedings with respect to disputed facts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notice of suspending official's decision.
