                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Supervision. Supervision must be provided for drop and count as  needed   by an agent(s) with authority equal to or greater than those being  supervised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Count room access. Controls must be established and procedures  implemented to limit physical access to the count room to count team  agents, designated staff, and other authorized persons. Such controls  must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Count team agents may not exit or enter the count room during  the count except for emergencies or scheduled breaks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surveillance must be notified whenever count room agents exit or  enter the count room during the count.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The count team policy, at a minimum, must address the  transportation of extraneous items such as personal belongings, tool  boxes, beverage containers, etc., into or out of the count room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Count team. Controls must be established and procedures  implemented to ensure security of the count and the count room to  prevent unauthorized access, misappropriation of funds, forgery, theft,  or fraud. Such controls must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For Tier A and B operations, all counts must be performed by at  least two agents. For Tier C operations, all counts must be performed by  at least three agents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Tier A and B operations, at no time during the count can  there be fewer than two count team agents in the count room until the  drop proceeds have been accepted into cage/vault accountability. For  Tier C operations, at no time during the count can there be fewer than  three count team agents in the count room until the drop proceeds have  been accepted into cage/vault accountability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For Tier A and B operations, count team agents must be rotated  on a routine basis such that the count team is not consistently the same  two agents more than four days per week. This standard does not apply to  gaming operations that utilize a count team of more than two agents. For  Tier C operations, count team agents must be rotated on a routine basis  such that the count team is not consistently the same three agents more  than four days per week. This standard does not apply to gaming  operations that utilize a count team of more than three agents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Functions performed by count team agents must be rotated on a  routine basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Count team agents must be independent of the department being  counted. A cage/vault agent may be used if they are not the sole  recorder of the count and do not participate in the transfer of drop  proceeds to the cage/vault. An accounting agent may be used if there is  an independent audit of all count documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Card game drop standards. Controls must be established and  procedures implemented to ensure security of the drop process. Such  controls must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surveillance must be notified when the drop is to begin so that  surveillance may monitor the activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least two agents must be involved in the removal of the drop  box, at least one of whom is independent of the card games department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Once the drop is started, it must continue until finished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All drop boxes may be removed only at the time previously  designated by the gaming operation and reported to the TGRA. If an  emergency drop is required, surveillance must be notified before the  drop is conducted and the TGRA must be informed within a timeframe  approved by the TGRA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> At the end of each shift:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All locked card game drop boxes must be removed from the tables  by an agent independent of the card game shift being dropped;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For any tables opened during the shift, a separate drop box  must be placed on each table, or a gaming operation may utilize a single  drop box with separate openings and compartments for each shift; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Card game drop boxes must be transported directly to the count  room or other equivalently secure area by a minimum of two agents, at  least one of whom is independent of the card game shift being dropped,  until the count takes place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All tables that were not open during a shift and therefore not  part of the drop must be documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> All card game drop boxes must be posted with a number  corresponding to   a permanent number on the gaming table and marked to indicate game,  table number, and shift, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Player interface and financial instrument storage component drop  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surveillance must be notified when the drop is to begin so that  surveillance may monitor the activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least two agents must be involved in the removal of the  player interface storage component drop, at least one of whom is  independent of the player interface department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All financial instrument storage components may be removed only  at the time previously designated by the gaming operation and reported  to the TGRA.

Separate counts of chips and tokens must  always be performed by members of the count team.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Coupons or other promotional items not included in gross  revenue must be recorded on a supplemental document by either the count  team members or accounting personnel. All single-use coupons must be  cancelled daily by an authorized agent to prevent improper  recirculation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a currency counter interface is used:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> It must be restricted to prevent unauthorized access; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The currency drop figures must be transferred via direct  communications line or computer storage media to the accounting  department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If currency counters are utilized, a count team member must  observe the loading and unloading of all currency at the currency  counter, including rejected currency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Two counts of the currency rejected by the currency counter must  be recorded per table, as well as in total. Posting rejected currency to  a nonexistent table is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Card game drop boxes, when empty, must be shown to another  member of the count team, to another   agent observing the count, or to surveillance, provided that the count  is monitored in its entirety by an agent independent of the count.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Procedures must be implemented to ensure that any corrections  to the count documentation are permanent and identifiable, and that the  original, corrected information remains legible. Corrections must be  verified by two count team agents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The count sheet must be reconciled to the total drop by a count  team member who may not function as the sole recorder, and variances  must be reconciled and documented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> All count team agents must sign the count sheet attesting to  their participation in the count.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A final verification of the total drop proceeds, before  transfer to cage/vault, must be performed by at least two agents, one of  whom is a supervisory count team member, and one a count team agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Final verification must include a comparison of currency counted  totals against the currency counter/system report, if any counter/system  is used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any unresolved variances must be documented, and the  documentation must remain part of the final count record forwarded to  accounting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This verification does not require a complete recount of the  drop proceeds, but does require a review sufficient to verify the total  drop proceeds being transferred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The two agents must sign the report attesting to the accuracy  of the total drop proceeds verified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All drop proceeds and cash equivalents that were counted must be  submitted to the cage or vault agent (who must be independent of the  count team), or to an agent independent of the revenue generation source  and the count process, for verification.
