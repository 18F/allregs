                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever the Office considers the principal sum of the indemnity  bond or letters of credit filed or the amount of the negotiable  securities deposited by a self-insurer insufficient to fully secure the  self-insurer's LHWCA obligations, the self-insurer must, upon demand by  the Office, deposit additional security in accordance with the  regulations in this part in an amount fixed by the Branch. The Branch  will issue its decision requiring additional security in accordance with  Sec. 703.303, and the procedures set forth at Sec. Sec. 703.303(d) and  703.304 for requesting a hearing and complying with the Office's  decision will apply as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Office may reduce the required security at any time on its  own initiative, or upon application of a self-insurer, when in the  Office's opinion the facts warrant a reduction. A self-insurer seeking a  reduction must furnish any information the Office requests regarding its  current affairs, the nature and hazard of the work of its employees, the  amount of its payroll for employees engaged in maritime employment  within the purview of the Act, its financial condition, its accident  experience, a record of compensation payments it has made, and any other  evidence the Branch considers necessary.</p>
