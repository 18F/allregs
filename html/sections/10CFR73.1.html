                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This part prescribes requirements for the establishment and maintenance of a physical protection system which will have capabilities for the protection of special nuclear material at fixed sites and in transit and of plants in which special nuclear material is used. The following design basis threats, where referenced in ensuing sections of this part, shall be used to design safeguards systems to protect against acts of radiological sabotage and to prevent the theft or diversion of special nuclear material. Licensees subject to the provisions of Sec. 73.20 (except for fuel cycle licensees authorized under Part 70 of this chapter to receive, acquire, possess, transfer, use, or deliver for transportation formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material), Sec. Sec. 73.50, and 73.60 are exempt from Sec. Sec. 73.1(a)(1)(i)(E), 73.1(a)(1)(iii), 73.1(a)(1)(iv), 73.1(a)(2)(iii), and 73.1(a)(2)(iv). Licensees subject to the provisions of Sec. 72.212 are exempt from Sec. 73.1(a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Radiological sabotage. (i) A determined violent external assault, attack by stealth, or deceptive actions, including diversionary actions, by an adversary force capable of operating in each of the following modes: A single group attacking through one entry point, multiple groups attacking through multiple entry points, a combination of one or more groups and one or more individuals attacking through multiple entry points, or individuals attacking through separate entry points, with the following attributes, assistance and equipment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Well-trained (including military training and skills) and dedicated individuals, willing to kill or be killed, with sufficient knowledge to identify specific equipment or locations necessary for a successful attack;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Active (e.g., facilitate entrance and exit, disable alarms and communications, participate in violent attack) or passive (e.g., provide information), or both, knowledgeable inside assistance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Suitable weapons, including hand-held automatic weapons, equipped with silencers and having effective long range accuracy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hand-carried equipment, including incapacitating agents and explosives for use as tools of entry or for otherwise destroying reactor, facility, transporter, or container integrity or features of the safeguards system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Land and water vehicles, which could be used for transporting personnel and their hand-carried equipment to the proximity of vital areas; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An internal threat; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A land vehicle bomb assault, which may be coordinated with an external assault; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A waterborne vehicle bomb assault, which may be coordinated with an external assault; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A cyber attack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Theft or diversion of formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material. (i) A determined violent external assault, attack by stealth, or deceptive actions, including diversionary actions, by an adversary force capable of operating in each of the following modes: a single group attacking through one entry point, multiple groups attacking through multiple entry points, a combination of one or more groups and one or individuals attacking through multiple entry points, or individuals attacking through separate entry points, with the following attributes, assistance and equipment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Well-trained (including military training and skills) and dedicated individuals, willing to kill or be killed, with sufficient knowledge to identify specific equipment or locations necessary for a successful attack;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Active (e.g., facilitate entrance and exit, disable alarms and communications, participate in violent attack) or passive (e.g., provide information), or both, knowledgeable inside assistance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Suitable weapons, including hand-held automatic weapons, equipped with silencers and having effective long-range accuracy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hand-carried equipment, including incapacitating agents and explosives for use as tools of entry or for otherwise destroying reactor, facility,

transporter, or container integrity or features of the safe-guards system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Land and water vehicles, which could be used for transporting personnel and their hand-carried equipment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An internal threat; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A land vehicle bomb assault, which may be coordinated with an external assault; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A waterborne vehicle bomb assault, which may be coordinated with an external assault; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A cyber attack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope.
