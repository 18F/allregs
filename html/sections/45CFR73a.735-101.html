                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To assure that the business of the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) is conducted effectively, objectively, and without improper  influence or appearance thereof, all employees must be persons of  integrity and observe the highest standards of conduct. Because of FDA's  special regulatory responsibilities to the consumer and industry, its  employees must be especially alert to avoid any real or appearance of  conflict of their private interests with their public duties. Their  actions must be unquestionable and free from suspicion of partiality,  favoritism, or any hint of conflicting interests. This supplement  recognizes FDA's public obligation to set reasonable and fair safeguards  for the prevention of employee conflicts of interest. It is necessary to  meet FDA's regulatory responsibilities and to otherwise assure full  protection of the public confidence in the integrity of its employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Since FDA is a unique consumer protection and regulatory agency  within the Department, the DHHS Standards of Conduct need further  supplementation to reflect this role.   Therefore, for purposes of implementing the DHHS Standards of Conduct  regulations within the FDA, this supplement provides interpretive  definitions and additional requirements. As further guidance to its  employees and supervisory officials, FDA will issue internal procedural  instructions in accordance with this supplement.</p>
