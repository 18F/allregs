                            <p class="depth0">The Survivor Tier I PIA and the Employee RIB PIA are used in  computing the tier I component of a survivor annuity. The Combined  Earnings PIA, Social Security Earnings PIA and Railroad Earnings PIA may  be used in computing a vested dual benefit offset in the survivor tier  II component when the survivor tier II is based on a percentage of the  employee annuity tier II. In addition, these three PIA's are identical  to those dual benefit PIA's used in computing an employee retirement  annuity, as described in subpart B of this part, when the employee died  after being entitled to an annuity. Survivor annuity computations are  discussed in part 228 of this chapter. The Residual Lump-Sum PIA (RLS  PIA) is used in computing the amount of the residual lump-sum payable  when retirement annuity payments were made, as explained in part 234 of  this chapter.</p>
