                                Sec. 19.518  Name and address of bottler.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In setting forth the name and address of the bottler required by Sec. 19.517(f), the label must contain the words ``Bottled by'', ``Packed by'', or ``Filled by'' followed immediately by the name (or trade name) of the bottler and the place where the bottling takes place. If the bottler is the proprietor of more than one distilled spirits plant engaged in bottling operations, the label may include the addresses of all such plants immediately following the name (or trade name) of the bottler. The following additional rules apply to name and address labeling under this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the distiller of the spirits, the label may state, in lieu of the words ``Bottled by'', ``Packed by'', or ``Filled by'', followed by the bottler's name (or trade name) and address or addresses, the words ``Distilled by'', followed immediately by the name (or trade name) under which the particular spirits were distilled, or by any trade name shown on the distiller's permit covering the premises where the particular spirits were distilled, and the address (or addresses) of the distiller;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where ``straight whiskies'' of the same type produced in the same State by two or more different distillers are combined (either at time of bottling or at a warehouseman's bonded premises for further storage) and are subsequently bottled and labeled as ``straight whisky'', that ``straight whisky'' must be labeled as provided in the introductory paragraph of this section. However, where that combined ``straight whisky'' is bottled by or for the distillers of the whiskies, the label may contain, in lieu of the wording specified in that introductory paragraph, the words ``Distilled by'', followed immediately by the name (or trade name) of each distiller that distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky'', the address of each of the distilled spirits plants where a portion of the ``straight whisky'' was distilled, and the percentage of ``straight whisky'' distilled by each distiller (with a tolerance of plus or minus 2 percent). In addition, where ``straight whisky'' is made up of a mixture of ``straight whiskies'' of the same type distilled at two or more distilled spirits plants of the same proprietor located within the same State, and where that ``straight whisky'' is bottled by or for that proprietor, the label for the ``straight whisky'' may contain, in lieu of the wording specified in the introductory paragraph of this section, the words ``Distilled by'' followed by the name (or trade name) of the proprietor and the address of each of the distilled spirits plants that distilled a portion of the ``straight whisky'';</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where distilled spirits are bottled by or for the proprietor of a distilled spirits plant, the label may state, in lieu of the words ``Bottled by'',

``Packed by'', or ``Filled by'' followed by the bottler's name (or trade name) and address, the words ``Blended by'', ``Made by'', ``Prepared by'', ``Manufactured by'', or ``Produced by'' (whichever is appropriate to the process involved), followed by the name (or trade name) and the address (or addresses) of the distilled spirits plant proprietor;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the case of labels of distilled spirits bottled for a retailer or other person who is not the proprietor of the distilled spirits plant where the distilled spirits were distilled, the label may also state the name and address of that retailer or other person, preceded immediately by the words ``Bottled for'', ``Distributed by'', or other similar statement; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The label may state the address of the proprietor's principal place of business in lieu of the place where the bottling, distilling or processing operation occurred, provided that the address where the bottling, distilling, or other operation occurred is indicated by printing, coding, or other markings, on the label or on the bottle. The coding system employed must permit TTB to determine where the operation stated on the label occurred. Prior to using such a label or bottle coding system, the proprietor must send a notice to the appropriate TTB officer explaining the coding system.
