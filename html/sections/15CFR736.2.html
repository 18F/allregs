                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Information or facts that determine the applicability of the  general prohibitions. The following five types of facts determine your  obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Classification of the item. The classification of the item on  the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Destination. The country of ultimate destination for an export  or reexport (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country  Chart and the Commerce Control List);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> End-user. The ultimate end user (see General Prohibition Four  (paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and Supplement No. 1 to part 764 of  the EAR for references to persons with whom your transaction may not be  permitted; see General Prohibition Five (Paragraph (b)(5) of this  section) and part 744 for references to end-users for whom you may need  an export or reexport license).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> End-use. The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five  (paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general  end-use restrictions); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Conduct. Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight  forwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in part  744 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General prohibitions. The following ten general prohibitions  describe certain exports, reexports, and other conduct, subject to the  scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a  license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) or qualify under  part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general  prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the  EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the  Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three  (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports); however, selected License  Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the  EAR concerning embargo destinations and in Sec. 744.2(c) of the EAR  regarding nuclear end-uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General Prohibition One--Export and reexport of controlled items  to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, without a  license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to  another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the  following is true:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable  Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Export to the country of destination requires a license for the  control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR.

You are responsible for  ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied  export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order.  Orders denying export privileges are published in the Federal Register  when they are issued and are the legally controlling documents in  accordance with their terms. BIS also maintains compilations of persons  denied export privileges on its Web site at http://www.bis.doc.gov.
