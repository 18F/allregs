                            <p class="depth0">The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirement or provision of this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or other applicable law if the Administrator determines that application of the requirement or provision would adversely affect the Government's interest. The Administrator will exercise this authority only at the request of the State Director and on the recommendation of the appropriate program Assistant Administrator. Requests for exceptions must be made in writing by the State Director and supported with documentation to explain the adverse affect on the Government's interest, propose alternative courses of action, and show how the adverse affect will be eliminated or minimized if the exception is granted. Any settlement actions approved by the Administrator under this section will be documented on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1956-1 and returned to the State Office for submission to the Finance Office.</p>
