When the final claim(s) is submitted, a final accounting will be made by the State of any funds paid to the State under Sec. 416.1026 which have not been spent or committed prior to the effective date of our assumption of the disability determination function. Disputes concerning final accounting issues which cannot be resolved between the State and us will be resolved in proceedings before the Grant Appeals Board as described in 45 CFR part 416.</p>
