Such requests for information may relate to the identification of environmental, technical, regulatory, or economic matters that promote or detract from continued development of renewable energy technologies on the OCS. From the information received, the Director may evaluate potential refinements to the OCS Alternative Energy Program that promote development of the industry in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and that ensure fair value for use of the Nation's OCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BOEM may make such requests for information on a regional basis, and may tailor the requests to specific types of renewable energy technologies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BOEM will publish such requests for information by the Director in the Federal Register.
