                                Sec. 40.61  What are the preliminary steps in the collection process?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">As the collector, you must take the following steps before actually beginning a collection:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's work site, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test (see Sec. 40.191(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ensure that, when the employee enters the collection site, you begin the testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or is unable to urinate or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the employee is also going to take a DOT alcohol test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins.</p><p class="depth3">Example to paragraph (b)(1): An employee enters the test site for both a drug and an alcohol test. Normally, the collector would wait until the BAT had completed the alcohol test process before beginning the drug test process. However, there are some situations in which an exception to this normal practice would be reasonable. One such situation might be if several people were waiting for the BAT to conduct alcohol tests, but a drug testing collector in the same facility were free. Someone waiting might be able to complete a drug test without unduly delaying his or her alcohol test. Collectors and BATs should work together, however, to ensure that post-accident and reasonable suspicion alcohol tests happen as soon as possible (e.g., by moving the employee to the head of the line for alcohol tests).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to collect a specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must not collect, by catheterization or other means, urine from an unconscious employee to conduct a drug test under this part. Nor may you catheterize a conscious employee. However, you must inform an employee who normally voids through self-catheterization that the employee is required to provide a specimen in that manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, as an employee, you normally void through self-catheterization, and decline to do so, this constitutes a refusal to test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employed individual) or a Federal, state, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact a DER to verify the identity of the employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name, but does not have to include your picture, address, or telephone number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Explain the basic collection procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the CCF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Direct the employee to remove outer clothing (e.g., coveralls, jacket, coat, hat) that could be used to conceal items or substances that could be used to tamper with a specimen. You must also direct the employee to leave these garments and any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings with you or in a mutually agreeable location. You must advise the employee that failure to comply with your directions constitutes a refusal to test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the employee asks for a receipt for any belongings left with you, you must provide one.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must allow the employee to keep his or her wallet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must not ask the employee to remove other clothing (e.g., shirts, pants, dresses, underwear), to remove

all clothing, or to change into a hospital or examination gown (unless the urine collection is being accomplished simultaneously with a DOT agency-authorized medical examination).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must direct the employee to empty his or her pockets and display the items in them to ensure that no items are present which could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the employee can place the items back into his or her pockets. As the employee, you must allow the collector to make this observation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If, in your duties under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, you find any material that could be used to tamper with a specimen, you must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine if the material appears to be brought to the collection site with the intent to alter the specimen, and, if it is, conduct a directly observed collection using direct observation procedures (see Sec. 40.67); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine if the material appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site (e.g., eye drops), secure and maintain it until the collection process is completed and conduct a normal (i.e., unobserved) collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You must instruct the employee not to list medications that he or she is currently taking on the CCF. (The employee may make notes of medications on the back of the employee copy of the form for his or her own convenience, but these notes must not be transmitted to anyone else.)</p>
