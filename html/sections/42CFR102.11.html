                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Survivors of individuals who died as the direct result of a  covered injury. If the Secretary determines that a smallpox vaccine  recipient or vaccinia contact died as the direct result of a covered  injury (or injuries), his or her survivor(s) may be eligible for death  benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Survivors who may be eligible to receive benefits and order of  priority for benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Act uses the same categories of survivors  and order of priority for benefits as established and defined by the  PSOB Program, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and  (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The PSOB Program's categories of survivors (known in the PSOB  Program as beneficiaries) and order of priority for receipt of death  benefits are detailed under subpart 1 of part L of title I of the  Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796 et  seq.), as amended, as implemented in 28 CFR part 32, as amended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the PSOB Program, the person who is survived must satisfy the  eligibility requirements for a deceased public safety officer, whereas  the person who is survived under this Program must be a deceased  smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact who would otherwise have  been eligible under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unlike the PSOB Program, if there are no survivors eligible to  receive death benefits under the PSOB Program (as set forth in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section), the legal guardian of a deceased minor who was  a smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact may be eligible as a  survivor under this Program. Such legal guardianship must be determined  by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A surviving dependent younger than the age of 18 whose legal  guardian opts to receive a death benefit under the alternative  calculation on the dependent's behalf will have the same priority as  surviving eligible children under the PSOB Program (consistent with  paragraph (b)(2) of this section) even if the dependent is not the  surviving eligible child of the deceased person for purposes of the PSOB  Program. However, such a dependent may   only be eligible to receive benefits under the alternative death  benefits calculation, described in Sec.  102.82(d), and is not eligible  to receive death benefits under the standard calculation described in  Sec.  102.82(c). Because death benefits paid under the alternative  calculation will be paid to the dependents' legal guardian(s) on behalf  of all such dependents, the Secretary will not divide or apportion such  benefits among the dependents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any change in the order of priority of survivors or of the  eligible category of survivors under the PSOB Program shall apply to  requesters seeking death benefits under this Program on the effective  date of the change, even prior to any corresponding amendment to this  part. Such changes will apply to Request Packages pending with the  Program on the effective date of the change, as well as to requests  filed after that date.</p>
