                            <p class="depth0">Voluntary compliance is the goal of the Commission. Voluntary  compliance is achieved when a tribe and the NIGC staff are able to  resolve any potential enforcement issues prior to the Chair issuing an  enforcement action. This part sets forth efforts for achieving voluntary  compliance and enforcement action when voluntary compliance is not  forthcoming. While this part is intended to garner voluntary compliance  through a graduated enforcement process, there may be circumstances  under which a graduated enforcement process is omitted and an  enforcement action must be taken. This part also sets forth general  rules governing the Commission's enforcement of the Act, this chapter,  and tribal ordinances and resolutions approved by the Chair under part  522 of this chapter. Civil fines in connection with notice of violation  issued under this part are addressed in part 575 of this chapter.  [77 FR 47518, Aug. 9, 2012]</p>
