                            <p class="depth0">Locomotives that are required to meet the emission standards of this  part must meet the requirements of this section. These requirements  apply when the locomotive is new (for freshly manufactured or  remanufactured locomotives) and continue to apply throughout the useful  life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Crankcase emissions. Crankcase emissions may not be discharged  directly into the ambient atmosphere from any locomotive, except as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Locomotives may discharge crankcase emissions to the ambient  atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust emissions (either  physically or mathematically) during all emission testing. If you take  advantage of this exception, you must do both of the following things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacture the locomotives so that all crankcase emissions can  be routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part  1065, consistent with good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when  determining exhaust deterioration factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a), crankcase emissions that are  routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all  operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient  atmosphere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustable parameters. Locomotives that have adjustable  parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any  adjustment in the approved adjustable range. You must specify in your  application for certification the adjustable range of each adjustable  parameter on a new locomotive or new locomotive engine to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that safe locomotive operating characteristics are  available within that range, as required by section 202(a)(4) of the  Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521(a)(4)), taking into consideration the  production tolerances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limit the physical range of adjustability to the maximum extent  practicable to the range that is necessary for proper operation of the  locomotive or locomotive engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibited controls. You may not design or produce your  locomotives with emission control devices, systems, or elements of  design that cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public  health, welfare, or safety while operating. For example, this would  apply if the locomotive emits a noxious or toxic substance it would  otherwise not emit that contributes to such an unreasonable risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Evaporative and refueling controls. For locomotives fueled with  a volatile fuel you must design and produce them to minimize evaporative  emissions during normal operation, including periods when the engine is  shut down. You must also design and produce them to minimize the escape  of fuel vapors during refueling. Hoses used to refuel gaseous-fueled  locomotives may not be designed to be bled or vented to the atmosphere  under normal operating conditions. No valves or pressure relief vents  may be used on gaseous-fueled locomotives except as emergency safety  devices that do not operate at normal system operating flows and  pressures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Altitude requirements. All locomotives must be designed to  include features that compensate for changes in altitude so that the  locomotives will comply with the applicable emission standards when  operated at any altitude less than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 7000 feet above sea level for line-haul locomotives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 5500 feet above sea level for switch locomotives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Defeat devices. You may not equip your locomotives with a defeat  device.   A defeat device is an auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that  reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the  locomotive may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal  operation and use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This does not apply to AECDs you identify in your application  for certification if any of the following is true:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The conditions of concern were substantially included in the  applicable duty cycle test procedures described in subpart F of this  part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You show your design is necessary to prevent locomotive damage  or accidents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the  locomotive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The locomotive emissions when the AECD is functioning are at or  below the notch caps of Sec.  1033.101.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. This provision is  intended for AECDs that have the primary function of operating the  engine at a different speed than would be done to generate the same  propulsive power when not operating in hotel mode. Identify and describe  these AECDs in your application for certification. We may allow the  AECDs to modify engine calibrations where we determine that such  modifications are environmentally beneficial or needed for proper engine  function. You must obtain preliminary approval under Sec.  1033.210  before incorporating such modifications. Otherwise, you must apply the  same injection timing and intake air cooling strategies in hotel mode  and non-hotel mode.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as allowed by paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the stop/ start systems must shut off the main locomotive engine(s) after 30  minutes of idling (or less).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Stop/start systems may restart or continue idling for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To prevent engine damage such as to prevent the engine coolant  from freezing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To maintain air pressure for brakes or starter system, or to  recharge the locomotive battery.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To perform necessary maintenance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To otherwise comply with federal regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may ask to use alternate stop/start systems that will  achieve equivalent idle control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> See Sec.  1033.201 for provisions that allow you to obtain a  separate certificate for idle controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is not considered circumvention to allow a locomotive to idle  to heat or cool the cab, provided such heating or cooling is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Power meters. Tier 1 and later locomotives must be equipped with  MW-hr meters (or the equivalent) consistent with the specifications of  Sec.  1033.140.  [73 FR 37197, June 30, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 59189, Oct. 8, 2008; 75  FR 22982, Apr. 30, 2010]</p>
