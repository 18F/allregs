Whether a  request is for a commercial use depends on the purpose of the request  and the use to which the records will be put. When a request is from a  representative of the news media, a purpose or use supporting the  requester's news dissemination function is not a commercial use.</p><p class="depth0">Direct costs means those expenditures actually incurred in searching  for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requesters,  reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include  the salary of the employee performing the work and the cost of operating  duplicating machinery.

Freelance journalists will be considered as representatives of a news  media entity if they can show a solid basis for expecting publication  through such an entity. A publication contract is such a basis, and the  requester's past publication record may show such a basis.</p><p class="depth0">Request means any request for records made pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Requester means any person who makes a request for records to OGE.</p><p class="depth0">Review means the process of initially, or upon appeal (see  Sec. 2604.501(b)(3)), examining documents located in a response to a  request to determine whether any portion of any document is permitted to  be withheld. It also includes processing documents for disclosure, such  as redacting portions which may be withheld. Review does not include  time spent resolving general legal and policy issues regarding the  application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth0">Search means the time spent looking for material manually or by  automated means that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page  or line-by-line identification of material within documents.</p><p class="depth0">Working days means calendar days, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and  legal public holidays.
