                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Timely access to advisory committee records is an important element  of the public access requirements of the Act. Section 10(b) of the Act  provides for the contemporaneous availability of advisory committee  records that, when taken in conjunction with the ability to attend  committee meetings, provide a meaningful opportunity to comprehend fully  the work undertaken by the advisory committee. Although advisory  committee records may be withheld under the provisions of the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA), as amended, if there is a reasonable expectation  that the records sought fall within the exemptions contained in section  552(b) of FOIA, agencies may not require members of the public or other  interested parties to file requests for non-exempt advisory committee  records under the request and review process established by section  552(a)(3) of FOIA.</p>
