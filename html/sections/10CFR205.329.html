                                Sec. 205.329  Environmental requirements for Presidential Permits
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NEPA Compliance. Except as provided in paragraph (b) and (e) of this section, applicants seeking Presidential Permits will be financially responsible for the expenses of any contractor chosen by ERA to prepare any necessary environmental document arising from ERA's obligation to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in issuing such Presidential Permits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ERA will determine whether an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA) is required within 45 days of receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of the environmental information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the environmental determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an EIS is determined to be necessary, ERA will notify the applicant of the fee for completing the EIS within 90 days after the submission of the application and environmental information. The fee shall be based on the expenses estimated to be incurred by DOE in contracting to prepare the EIS (i.e., the estimated fee charges to ERA by the contractor). DOE employee salaries and other fixed costs, as set forth in OMB Circular A-25, shall not be included in the applicant's fee. Fee payment shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United States, and shall be submitted to ERA. Upon submission of fifty percent of the environmental fee, ERA will provide to the applicant a tentative schedule for completion of the EIS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may choose to have ERA prepare the EA pursuant to the fee procedures set forth above.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The NEPA process must be completed and approved before ERA will issue a Presidential Permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial Hardship. Whenever ERA determines that a project is no longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, completely or in part, with its own resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Discussions Prior to Filing. Prior to the preparation of any Presidential Permit application and environmental

assessment, a potential applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each affected State public utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of the proposed project and the potential for joint State and Federal environmental review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fee Payment. The applicant shall make fee payment for completing the EIS to ERA in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 50 percent of the total amount due to be paid within 30 days of receipt of the fee information from DOE;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the draft EIS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the final EIS.
If costs are less than the amount collected, ERA will refund to the applicant the excess fee collected. If costs exceed the initial fee, ERA will fund the balance, unless the increase in costs is caused by actions or inactions of the applicant, such as the applicant's failure to submit necessary environmental information in a timely fashion. If the application is withdrawn at any stage prior to issuance of the final EIS, the fee will be adjusted to reflect the costs actually incurred; payment shall be made by the applicant within 30 days of above referenced events.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Federal Exemption. Upon a showing by the applicant that it is engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal Government in filing an application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320 et seq., it will be exempt from the requirements of this section.
