                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Freedom of information. Subchapter R of this title contains regulations on the availability to the public of information and records of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter R apply to such disclosures by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determinations required by law. Section 38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) provides by reference to certain procedures of the Export Administration Act that certain information required by the Department of State in connection with the licensing process may generally not be disclosed to the public unless certain determinations relating to the national interest are made in accordance with the procedures specified in that provision, except that the names of the countries and types and quantities of

defense articles for which licenses are issued under this section shall not be withheld from public disclosure unless the President determines that release of such information would be contrary to the national interest. Registration with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls is required of certain persons, in accordance with Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act. The requirements and guidance are provided in the ITAR pursuant to parts 122 and 129. Registration is generally a precondition to the issuance of any license or other approvals under this subchapter, to include the use of any exemption. Therefore, information provided to the Department of State to effect registration, as well as that regarding actions taken by the Department of State related to registration, may not generally be disclosed to the public. Determinations required by Section 38(e) shall be made by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information required under part 130. Part 130 of this subchapter contains specific provisions on the disclosure of information described in that part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> National Interest Determinations. In accordance with section 38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(e)), the Secretary of State has determined that the following disclosures are in the national interest of the United States:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Furnishing information to foreign governments for law enforcement or regulatory purposes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Furnishing information to foreign governments and other agencies of the U.S. Government in the context of multilateral or bilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia Group, and Wassenaar Arrangement).
