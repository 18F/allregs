You must provide us with your retained copy of your amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return on the required IRS form and a copy of the IRS letter confirming the amended tax return was filed or a transcript from IRS if they did not send a letter. If you cannot provide your retained copy of the amended tax return, you must obtain a copy of the return from IRS. We will then make any necessary retroactive corrections as defined in Sec. 418.1110(c) to your income-related monthly adjustment amount.</p><p class="depth0">Determinations Using a More Recent Tax Year's Modified Adjusted Gross</p><p class="depth0">Income</p>
