Peel back, cleanly and evenly, about 2 inches (50 millimeters) of one end of the 1 inch (25 millimeters) wide organic strip. Attach a strip of reinforced pressure sensitive tape to the side of the organic strip opposite the adhesive, to extend this free end to about 8 inches (200 millimeters) in length. Place the end of the glass panel from which the organic strip was removed in the lower clamp of the tensile tester and the free end of the tape in the upper clamp.
