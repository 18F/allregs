                            <p class="depth0">This subpart prescribes the process that the Secretary uses to  determine whether a BIA self-governance funding agreement causes a  limitation or reduction in the services, contracts, or funds that any  other Tribe/Consortium or Tribal organization is eligible to receive  under self-determination contracts, other self-governance compacts, or  direct services from BIA. This type of limitation is prohibited by  section 406(a) of Pub. L. 93-638. For the purposes of this subpart,  Tribal organization means an organization eligible to receive services,  contracts, or funds under section 102 of Pub. L. 93-638.</p>
