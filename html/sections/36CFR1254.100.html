                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NARA evaluates requests by estimating how well completion of a  proposed project would further our efforts to preserve and to make  available to the public the historically valuable records of the  Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In considering multiple requests to film at the same time, we  give priority to microfilming records that have research value for a  variety of studies or that contain basic information for fields of  research in which researchers have demonstrated substantial interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The records to be filmed should be reasonably complete and not  subject to future additions, especially of appreciable volumes, within  the original body of records. Records with pending or future end-of- series additions are appropriate for filming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The records to be filmed should not have substantial numbers of  documents withdrawn because of continuing national security  classification, privacy, or other restrictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We approve only requests to microfilm a complete body of  documents, such as an entire series or a major continuous segment of a  very large series that is reasonably divisible. Microfilming a complete  body of documents means that you must consecutively copy all documents  within the file unit(s), from the first to the last page, not skipping  any pages in between except for pages that are exact duplicates or blank  pages that are not included in a pagination scheme.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We normally approve only requests that include assurances that  the project will adhere to the specifications in part 1230 of this  chapter concerning microfilm stock standards, index placement, and  microfilm processing for permanent records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We approve only requests that specify that NARA will receive a  first generation silver halide duplicate negative containing no splices  made from the original camera negative of the microform record created  in accordance with part 1230 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We may use this duplicate negative microform to make duplicate  preservation and reference copies. The copies may be made available for  NARA and public use in NARA facilities and programs immediately upon  receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We may also make additional use of the microform, as indicated  in Sec. 1254.98, seven years after you complete filming at the NARA  facility, or upon delivery of the publication if there is no commercial  distributor, or when the commercial distributor is no longer available,  whichever occurs first. We may choose to add our own editorial material  to the microform copies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must deliver detailed roll lists with the microfilm. The  lists must give the full range of file titles and a complete list of all  file numbers on each roll of microfilm. We prefer that the list be  provided in a fielded, electronic format to facilitate its use by staff  and researchers. If the electronic format is a data file with defined or  delimited fields, you should transfer with the file the records layout  identifying the fields, any coded values for fields, and explanations of  any delimiters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Microfilm projects may donate to us additional indexes and  finding aids. NARA and the microfilm project execute a deed of gift that  specifies restrictions on NARA's use and dissemination of these products  under mutually acceptable terms.</p>
