As used in this definition, ``float line'' means a line used  to suspend the main longline beneath a float, and ``light stick'' means  any type of light emitting device, including any fluorescent ``glow  bead,'' chemical, or electrically-powered light that is affixed  underwater to the longline gear.</p><p class="depth0">Effective date means the date upon which the Regional Administrator  provides written notice to the authorized official or designated  representative of the U.S. participating territory that a specified  fishing agreement meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Fish dealer means any person who:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Obtains, with the intention to resell, western Pacific pelagic  MUS, or portions thereof, that were harvested or received by a vessel  that holds a permit or is otherwise regulated under bottomfish fisheries  in this subpart;
