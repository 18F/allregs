                                Sec. 2200.32  Signing of pleadings and motions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Pleadings and motions shall be signed by the filing party or by the  party's representative. The signature of a representative constitutes a  representation by him that he is authorized to represent the party or  parties on whose behalf the pleading is filed. The signature of a  representative or party also constitutes a certificate by him that he  has read the pleading, motion, or other paper, that to the best of his  knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it  is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good  faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing  law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to  harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in   the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion or other paper is signed  in violation of this rule, such signing party or its representative  shall be subject to the sanctions set forth in Sec. 2200.101 or  Sec. 2200.104. A signature by a party representative constitutes a  representation by him that he understands that the rules and orders of  the Commission and its Judges apply equally to attorney and non-attorney  representatives.
