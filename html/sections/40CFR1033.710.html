You may average emission credits only as allowed by Sec.  1033.740.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may certify one or more engine families to an FEL above the applicable emission standard, subject to the FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you certify an engine family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable emission standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the engine family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in Sec.  1033.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other engine families that generate emission credits in the same model year, from emission credits you have banked, or from emission credits you obtain through trading or by transfer.</p>
