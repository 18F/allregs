An operation will not be considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A public highway-rail crossing that is in use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An at-grade rail crossing that is in use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Although the duties imposed by this part are generally stated in terms of the duty of a railroad, each person, including a contractor or subcontractor for a railroad, who performs any task covered by this part, shall perform that task in accordance with this part.
