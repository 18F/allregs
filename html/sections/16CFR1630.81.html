The purpose of this section is to state the policy of  the Commission concerning recall of carpets and rugs which are subject  to and fail to comply with the Standard for the Surface Flammability of  Carpets and Rugs (FF 1-70) (16 CFR part 1630, subpart A). In this policy  statement, the Commission reaffirms that provisions of the Flammable  Fabrics Act (FFA) authorize recall of any product which fails to comply  with an applicable flammability standard issued under that Act.  Additionally, this policy statement announces general principles which  will be followed by the Commission in exercising the authority contained  in the FFA to require recall of carpets and rugs from various levels of  distribution, including carpets and rugs in the possession of the  ultimate consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recall from distributors and retailers. The Commission will  exercise the authority contained in the FFA to order recall of carpets  and rugs which fail to comply with the Standard for the Surface  Flammability for Carpets and Rugs and which are in the possession of any  distributor, retailer, or other person or firm in the chain of  distribution, where the facts, including the number and pattern of test  failures, indicate that such action is necessary and appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recall from consumers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases involving carpets and rugs  distributed in commerce by a domestic manufacturer, or imported into the  United States, after July 11, 1978, the Commission will exercise the  authority contained in the FFA to order recall of carpets and rugs which  fail to comply with the Standard for the Surface Flammability of Carpets  and Rugs and which are in the possession of ultimate purchasers,  including installed carpet, where the facts, including the number and  pattern of test failures, indicate that such action is necessary and  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission may exercise the authority of section 15 of the  Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2064) to order the repair,  replacement, or repurchase of any carpets or rugs in the possession of  ultimate purchasers, including installed carpet, if such carpets and  rugs present a ``substantial product hazard'' as that term is used in  the Consumer Product Safety Act in any case involving carpets or rugs  which were distributed in commerce by a domestic manufacturer or  imported into the United States, on or before July 11, 1978, or any time  thereafter.
