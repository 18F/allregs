                                Sec. 1.30002  Tower construction or modification near AM stations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Proponents of construction or significant modification of a  tower which is within one wavelength of a nondirectional AM station, and  is taller than 60 electrical degrees at the AM frequency, must notify  the AM station at least 30 days in advance of the commencement of  construction. The proponent shall examine the potential impact of the  construction or modification as described in paragraph (c) of this  section. If the construction or modification would distort the radiation  pattern by more than 2 dB, the proponent shall be responsible for the  installation and maintenance of any detuning apparatus necessary to  restore proper operation of the nondirectional antenna.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proponents of construction or significant modification of a  tower which is within the lesser of 10 wavelengths or 3 kilometers of a  directional AM station, and is taller than 36 electrical degrees at the  AM frequency, must notify the AM station at least 30 days in advance of  the commencement of construction. The proponent shall examine the  potential impact of the construction or modification as described in  paragraph (c) of this section. If the construction or modification would  result in radiation in excess of the AM station's licensed standard  pattern or augmented standard pattern values, the proponent shall be  responsible for the installation and maintenance of any detuning  apparatus necessary to restore proper operation of the directional  antenna.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this chapter, except that the AM antenna  elements may be modeled as a series of thin wires driven to produce the  required radiation pattern, without any requirement for measurement of  tower impedances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A significant modification of a tower in the immediate vicinity  of an AM station is defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any change that would alter the tower's physical height by 5  electrical degrees or more at the AM frequency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The addition or replacement of one or more antennas or  transmission lines on a tower that has been detuned or base-insulated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The addition or modification of an antenna or antenna-supporting  structure on a building shall be considered a construction or  modification subject to the analysis and notice requirements of this  subpart if and only if the height of the antenna-supporting structure  alone exceeds the thresholds in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> With respect to an AM station that was authorized pursuant to a  directional proof of performance based on field strength measurements,  the proponent of the tower construction or modification may, in lieu of  the study described in paragraph (c) of this section, demonstrate  through measurements taken before and after construction that field  strength values at the monitoring points do not exceed the licensed  values. In the event that the pre-construction monitoring point values  exceed the licensed values, the proponent may demonstrate that post- construction monitoring point values do not exceed the pre-construction  values. Alternatively, the AM station may file for authority to increase  the relevant monitoring-point value after performing a partial proof of  performance in accordance with Sec. 73.154 to establish that the  licensed radiation limit on the applicable radial is not exceeded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Tower construction or modification that falls outside the  criteria described in the preceding paragraphs is presumed to have no  significant effect on an AM station. In some instances, however, an AM  station may be affected by tower construction or modification  notwithstanding the criteria set forth above. In such cases, an AM  station may submit a showing that its operation has been affected by  tower construction or modification. Such a showing shall consist of  either a moment method analysis as described in paragraph (c) of this  section, or of field strength measurements. The showing shall be  provided to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tower proponent if the showing relates to a tower that has  not yet been constructed or modified and otherwise to the current tower  owner; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the Commission, within two years after the date of completion  of the tower construction or modification. If necessary, the Commission  shall direct the tower proponent or tower owner, if the tower proponent  or tower owner holds a Commission authorization, to install and maintain  any detuning apparatus necessary to restore proper operation of the AM  antenna. An applicant for a Commission authorization may not propose,  and a party holding a Commission authorization may not locate, an  antenna on any tower or support structure that has been shown to affect  an AM station's operation pursuant to this subparagraph, or for which a  disputed showing of effect on an AM station's operation is pending,  unless the applicant, party, or tower owner notifies the AM station and  takes appropriate action to correct the disturbance to the AM pattern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An AM station may submit a showing that its operation has been  affected by tower construction or modification that was commenced or  completed prior to or on the effective date of the rules adopted in this  Part pursuant to MM Docket No. 93-177. Such a showing shall consist of  either a moment method analysis as described in paragraph (c) of this  section, or of field strength measurements. The showing shall be  provided to the current tower owner and the Commission within one year  of the effective date of the rules adopted in this Part pursuant to MM  Docket No. 93-177. If necessary, the Commission shall direct the tower  owner, if the tower owner holds a Commission authorization, to install  and maintain any detuning apparatus necessary to restore proper  operation of the AM antenna.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An applicant for a Commission authorization may not propose, and  a party holding a Commission authorization may not locate, an antenna on  any tower or support structure, whether constructed before or after  December 5,   2013, that meets the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,  unless the analysis and notice process described in this subpart, and  any necessary measures to correct disturbances of the AM radiation  pattern, have been completed by the tower owner, the party proposing to  locate the antenna, or any other party, either prior to construction or  at any other time prior to the proposal or antenna location.
