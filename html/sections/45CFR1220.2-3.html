The regional office shall provide each sponsor with a 24-hour telephone number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Immediately after notification of the appropriate office, and with the approval thereof, the sponsor shall advance up to $500 for the payment of bail or such other legal expenses as are necessary prior to arraignment to prevent the volunteer from being incarcerated. In the event it is subsequently determined that ACTION or a sponsor is not responsible under this policy for the volunteer's defense, any such advance may be recovered directly from the volunteer or from allowances, stipends, or out-of-pocket expenses which are payable or become payable to the volunteer. In the case of a grassroots sponsor of full-time volunteers which is not able to provide the $500 the ACTION state or regional office shall immediately make such sum available to the sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immediately upon receipt of notification from the sponsor, the state or regional office shall notify the General Counsel, giving all facts and circumstances at that time known to such office. Thereafter the office shall cooperate with the General Counsel in making an investigation of all surrounding facts and circumstances and shall provide such information immediately to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The General Counsel shall, upon notification by the state or regional office, determine the extent to which ACTION will provide funds for the volunteer's defense or reimburse a sponsor for funds it spends on the volunteer's behalf. Included in this responsibility shall be the negotiation of fees and approval of other costs and expenses. State and regional offices are not authorized to commit ACTION to the payment of volunteers' legal expenses or to reimburse a sponsor except as provided above, without the express consent of the General Counsel. Additionally, the General Counsel shall, in cases arising directly out of the performance of authorized project activities, ascertain whether the services of the United States Attorney can be made available to the volunteer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The sponsor and the state and regional office shall have a continuing responsibility for cooperation and coordination with the Office of General Counsel during the pendency of any such litigation, and of notifying the General Counsel of any facts and circumstances which come to the attention of such office or the sponsor which affects such litigation.</p>
