A registered security- based swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice to  participants and to the public of its normal closing hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A registered security-based swap data repository may declare, on  an ad hoc basis, special closing hours to perform system maintenance  that cannot wait until normal closing hours. A registered security-based  swap data repository shall, to the extent reasonably possible under the  circumstances, avoid scheduling special closing hours during periods  when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are  most active; and provide reasonable advance notice of its special  closing hours to participants and to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During normal closing hours, and to the extent reasonably  practicable during special closing hours, a registered security-based  swap data repository shall have the capability to receive and hold in  queue information regarding security-based swaps that has been reported  pursuant to Secs. 242.900 through 242.909.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a registered security-based swap data repository re-opens  following normal closing hours or special   closing hours, it shall disseminate transaction reports of security- based swaps held in queue, in accordance with the requirements of  Sec. 242.902.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a registered security-based swap data repository could not  receive and hold in queue transaction information that was required to  be reported pursuant to Secs. 242.900 through 242.909, it must  immediately upon re-opening send a message to all participants that it  has resumed normal operations. Thereafter, any participant that had an  obligation to report information to the registered security-based swap  data repository pursuant to Secs. 242.900 through 242.909, but could not  do so because of the registered security-based swap data repository's  inability to receive and hold in queue data, must promptly report the  information to the registered security-based swap data repository.</p>
