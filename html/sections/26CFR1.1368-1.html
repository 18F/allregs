                                Sec. 1.1368-1  Distributions by S corporations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and this section, would be subject to section 301(c) and other  rules of the Internal Revenue Code that characterize a distribution as a  dividend.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date distribution made. For purposes of section 1368, a  distribution is taken into account on the date the corporation makes the  distribution, regardless of when the distribution is treated as received  by the shareholder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> S corporation with no earnings and profits. A distribution made  by an S corporation that has no accumulated earnings and profits as of  the end of the taxable year of the S corporation in which the  distribution is made is treated in the manner provided in section  1368(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> S corporation with earnings and profits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General treatment  of distribution. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section,  a distribution made with respect to its stock by an S corporation that  has accumulated earnings and profits as of the end of the taxable year  of the S corporation in which the distribution is made is treated in the  manner provided in section 1368(c). See section 316 and Sec. 1.316-2  for provisions relating to the allocation of earnings and profits among  distributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certain adjustments taken into account--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxable years  beginning before January 1, 1997. For any taxable year of the  corporation beginning before January 1, 1997, paragraphs (c) and (d) of  this section are applied only after taking into account--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The adjustments to the basis of the shares of a shareholder's  stock described in section 1367 (without regard to section 1367(a)(2)(A)  (relating to decreases attributable to distributions not includible in  income)) for the S corporation's taxable year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The adjustments to the AAA required by section 1368(e)(1)(A)  (but without regard to the adjustments for distributions under Sec.  1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii)) for the S corporation's taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning on or after August 18, 1998. For any  taxable year of the corporation beginning on or after August 18, 1998,  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are applied only after taking  into account--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The adjustments to the basis of the shares of a shareholder's  stock described in section 1367(a)(1) (relating to increases in basis of  stock) for the S corporation's taxable year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii))</em> for the  taxable year shall not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Elections relating to source of distributions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.  An S corporation may modify the application of   paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section by electing (pursuant to  paragraph (f)(5) of this section)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To distribute earnings and profits first as described in  paragraph (f)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To make a deemed dividend as described in paragraph (f)(3) of  this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To forego previously taxed income as described in paragraph  (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Election to distribute earnings and profits first--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  general. An S corporation with accumulated earnings and profits may  elect under this paragraph (f)(2) for any taxable year to distribute  earnings and profits first as provided in section 1368(e)(3). Except as  provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, distributions made by  an S corporation making this election are treated as made first from  earnings and profits under section 1368(c)(2) and second from the AAA  under section 1368(c)(1). Any remaining portion of the distribution is  treated in the manner provided in section 1368(b). This election is  effective for all distributions made during the year for which the  election is made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Previously taxed income. If a corporation to which paragraph  (d)(2) of this section (relating to corporations with previously taxed  income) applies makes the election provided in this paragraph (f)(2) for  the taxable year, and does not make the election to forego previously  taxed income under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, distributions by  the S corporation during the taxable year are treated as made first,  from previously taxed income under paragraph (d)(2) of this section;  second, from earnings and profits under section 1368(c)(2); and third,  from the AAA under section 1368(c)(1). Any portion of a distribution  remaining after the previously taxed income, earnings and profits, and  the AAA are exhausted is treated in the manner provided in section  1368(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Corporation with subchapter C and subchapter S earnings and  profits. If an S corporation that makes the election provided in this  paragraph (f)(2) has both subchapter C earnings and profits (as defined  in section 1362(d)(3)(B)) and subchapter S earnings and profits in a  taxable year of the corporation in which the distribution is made, the  distribution is treated as made first from subchapter C earnings and  profits, and second from subchapter S earnings and profits. Subchapter S  earnings and profits are earnings and profits accumulated in a taxable  year beginning before January 1, 1983 (or in the case of a qualified  casualty insurance electing small business corporation or a qualified  oil corporation, earnings and profits accumulated in any taxable year),  for which an election under subchapter S of chapter 1 of the Internal  Revenue Code was in effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, the S corporation  will be considered to have made the election provided in paragraph  (f)(2) of this section (relating to the election to distribute earnings  and profits first). The amount of the deemed dividend may not exceed the  subchapter C earnings and profits of the corporation on the last day of  the taxable year, reduced by any actual distributions of subchapter C  earnings and profits made during the taxable year. The amount of the  deemed dividend is considered, for all purposes of the Internal Revenue  Code, as if it were distributed in money to the shareholders in  proportion to their stock ownership, received by the shareholders, and  immediately contributed by the shareholders to the corporation, all on  the last day of the corporation's taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, are treated  in the manner provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Time and manner of making elections--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For earnings and  profits. If an election is made under paragraph (f)(2) of this section  to distribute earnings and profits first, see section 1368(e)(3)  regarding the consent required by shareholders.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For previously taxed income and deemed dividends. If an  election is made to forego previously taxed income under paragraph  (f)(4) of this section or to make a deemed dividend under paragraph  (f)(3) of this section, consent by each ``affected shareholder,'' as  defined in section 1368(e)(3)(B), is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> shall be verified  by signing the return. A statement of election to make a deemed dividend  under Sec. 1.1368-1(f) must include the amount of the deemed dividend  that is distributed to each shareholder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Irrevocable elections. The elections under this paragraph (f)  are irrevocable and are effective only for the taxable year for which  they are made. In applying the preceding sentence to elections under  this paragraph (f), an election to terminate the taxable year under  section 1377(a)(2) or Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2) is disregarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rule--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election to terminate year under Sec. 1.1368- 1(g)(2). If an election is made under paragraph (g)(2) of this section  to terminate the year when there is a qualifying disposition, this  section applies as if the taxable year consisted of separate taxable  years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which there is  a qualifying disposition of stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> to treat the year as if it consisted of separate  taxable years, the first of which ends at the close of the day on which  the qualifying disposition occurs. A qualifying disposition is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A disposition by a shareholder of 20 percent or more of the  outstanding stock of the corporation in one or more transactions during  any thirty-day period during the corporation's taxable year;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A redemption treated as an exchange under section 302(a) or  section 303(a) of 20 percent or more of the outstanding stock of the  corporation from a shareholder in one or more transactions during any  thirty-day period during the corporation's taxable year; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An issuance of an amount of stock equal to or greater than 25  percent of the previously outstanding stock to one or more new  shareholders during any thirty-day period during the corporation's  taxable year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of the election. A corporation making an election under  paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section must treat the taxable year as  separate taxable years for purposes of allocating items of income and  loss; making adjustments to the AAA, earnings and profits, and basis;  and determining the tax effect of distributions under section 1368 (b)  and (c). An election made under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section may  be made upon the occurrence of any qualifying disposition. Dispositions  of stock that are taken into account as part of a qualifying disposition  are not taken into account in determining whether a subsequent  qualifying disposition has been made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Time and manner of making election. A corporation makes an  election under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) for a taxable year by attaching a  statement to a timely filed (including extensions) original or amended  return required to be filed under section 6037 for a taxable year  (without regard to the election under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i)). In the  statement, the corporation must state that it is electing for the  taxable year under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) to treat the taxable year as  if it consisted of separate taxable years. The corporation also must set  forth facts in the statement relating to the qualifying disposition  (e.g., sale, gift, stock issuance, or redemption), and state that each  shareholder who held stock in the corporation during the taxable year  (without regard to the election under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i)) consents  to this election. For purposes of this election, a shareholder of the  corporation for the taxable year is a shareholder as described in  section 1362(a)(2). A single election statement may be filed for all  elections made under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) for the taxable year. An  election made under Sec. 1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) is irrevocable. In the case  of elections for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, the  statement through which a corporation makes an election under Sec.  1.1368-1(g)(2)(i) must be signed by an officer of the corporation under  penalties of perjury. In the case of elections for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 2002, the statement described in the  preceding sentence shall be verified by signing the return.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Coordination with election under section 1377(a)(2). If the  event resulting in a qualifying disposition also results in a  termination of a shareholder's entire interest as described in Sec.  1.1377-1(b)(4), the election under this paragraph (g)(2) cannot be made.  Rather, the election under section 1377(a)(2) and Sec. 1.1377-1(b) may  be made. See Sec. 1.1377-1(b) (concerning the election under section  1377(a)(2)).
