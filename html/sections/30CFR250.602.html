                            <p class="depth0">The movement of well-workover rigs and related equipment on and off a platform or from well to well on the same platform, including rigging up and rigging down, shall be conducted in a safe manner. All wells in the same well-bay which are capable of producing hydrocarbons shall be shut in below the surface with a pump-through-type tubing plug and at the surface with a closed master valve prior to moving well-workover rigs and related equipment unless otherwise approved by the District Manager. A closed surface-controlled subsurface safety valve of the pump-through-type may be used in lieu of the pump-through-type tubing plug provided that the surface control has been locked out of operation. The well to which a well-workover rig or related equipment is to be moved shall also be equipped with a back-pressure valve prior to removing the tree and installing and testing the blowout-preventer (BOP) system. The well from which a well-workover rig or related equipment is to be moved shall also be equipped with a back pressure valve prior to removing the BOP system and installing the tree. Coiled tubing units, snubbing units, or wireline units may be moved onto a platform without shutting in wells.</p>
