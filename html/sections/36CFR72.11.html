                            <p class="depth0">The local government will submit an Action Program which documents the recreation needs of the community together with action plans to meet those identified needs. This Action Program will indicate how the park and recreation system will be revitalized and maintained. While the emphasis of the Action Program will be placed on the rehabilitation of deteriorating facilities, it also will describe how the rehabilitation effort is linked to the overall goals, priorities and strategies of the park and recreation system. The local government must develop the Action Program consistent with and linked to the objectives, needs, plans, and institutional arrangements of the community. The Action Program must present evidence of its consistency with the community's long-range goals and plans as expressed in its comprehensive plans and other documents. The Action Program consists of two sections which are the Assessment and the Action Plan.</p>
