                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Submit initial, annual, and deviation reports electronically or  in paper format, postmarked on or before the submittal due dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submit results of performance tests and CEMS performance  evaluation tests as follows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance  test as required by this subpart, you must submit the results of the  performance tests required by this subpart to EPA's WebFIRE database by  using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) that  is accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX)(www.epa.gov/cdx).  Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated  through use of EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http:// www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ ert/index.html). Only data collected using test  methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for  submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who  claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests  is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT  file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk, flash  drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to EPA. The  electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/ OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02,  4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI  omitted must be submitted to EPA via CDX as described earlier in this  paragraph. At the discretion of the delegated authority, you must also  submit these reports, including the confidential business information,  to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated  authority. For any performance test conducted using test methods that  are not listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator shall submit  the results of the performance test in paper submissions to the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days after the date of completing each CEMS  performance evaluation test, as defined in this subpart and required by  this subpart, you must submit the relative accuracy test audit (RATA)  data electronically into EPA's Central Data Exchange by using CEDRI as  mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Only RATA pollutants that  can be documented with the ERT (as listed on the ERT Web site) are  subject to this requirement. For any performance evaluations with no  corresponding RATA pollutants listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or  operator shall submit the results of the performance evaluation in paper  submissions to the Administrator.
