The objective of this subpart is not to search for new contamination. Confirmation of compliance with the cleanup levels in Sec. 761.61(a)(4) is only verifiable for the area sampled in accordance with this subpart. Do not make conclusions or extrapolations about PCB concentrations outside of the area which has been cleaned up and verified based on the results of this verification sampling.</p>
