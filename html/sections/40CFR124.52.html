The discharger must apply for  a permit under Sec. 122.21 within 60 days of notice, unless permission  for a later date is granted by the Regional Administrator. The question  whether the designation was proper will remain open for consideration  during the public comment period under Sec. 124.11 and in any  subsequent hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)(v)</em>, and (a)(9)(iii) of this chapter), the  Regional Administrator may require the discharger to submit a permit  application or other information regarding the discharge under section  308 of the CWA.
