                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An employee is prohibited from requesting or otherwise  encouraging the tender of a gift or decoration from a foreign  government. An employee is also prohibited from accepting a gift or  decoration from a foreign government, except in accordance with these  regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee may accept and retain a gift of minimal value  tendered and received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy, subject,  however, to the following restrictions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where more than one tangible item is included in a single  presentation, the entire presentation shall be considered as one gift,  and the aggregate value of all items taken together must not exceed  ``minimal value''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The donee is responsible for determining that a gift is of  minimal value in the United States at the time of acceptance. However,  should any dispute result from a difference of opinion concerning the  value of a gift, the employing agency will secure the services of an  outside appraiser to establish whether the gift is one of ``minimal  value''. If, after an appraisal has been made, it is established that  the value of the gift in question is $200 or more at retail in the  United States, the donee will bear the costs of the appraisal. If,  however, the appraised value is established to be less than $200, the  employing agency will bear the costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee may accept a gift of more than minimal value when  (1) such gift is in the nature of an educational scholarship or medical  treatment, or (2) it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause  offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign  relations of the United States, except that a tangible gift of more than  minimal value is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United  States and, upon acceptance, shall become the property of the United  States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An employee may accept gifts of travel or expenses for travel  taking place entirely outside the United States (such as transportation,  food, and lodging) of more than minimal value if such acceptance is  appropriate, consistent with the interests of the United States, and  permitted by the employing agency. Except where the employing agency has  specific interests which may be favorably affected by employee travel  wholly outside the   United States, even though it would not normally authorize its employees  to engage in such travel, the standards normally applied to determine  when proposed travel will be in the best interests of the employing  agency and of the United States Government shall be applied in approving  acceptance of travel or travel expenses offered by a foreign government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There are two circumstances under which employees may accept  gifts of travel or expenses:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the employee is issued official travel orders placing him  or her in the position of accepting travel or travel expenses offered by  a foreign government which are directly related to the authorized  purpose of the travel; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the employee's travel orders specifically anticipate the  acceptance of additional travel and travel expenses incident to the  authorized travel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an employee is traveling under circumstances described in  paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, that is, without specific  instructions authorizing acceptance of additional travel expenses from a  foreign government, the employee must file a report with the employing  angency under the procedures prescribed in Sec. 3.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Since tangible gifts of more than minimal value may not lawfully  become the personal property of the donee, all supervisory officials  shall, in advising employees of their responsibilities under the  regulations, impress upon them their obligation to decline acceptance of  such gifts, whenever possible, at the time they are offered, or to  return them if they have been sent or delivered without a prior offer.  All practical measures, such as periodic briefings, shall be taken to  minimize the number of gifts which employees must deposit and which thus  become subject to disposal as provided by law and regulation. Employees  should not accept gifts of more than minimal value on the assumption  that refusal would be likely to ``cause offense or embarrassment or  otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States''.  In many instances it should be possible, by explanation of the  prohibition against an employee's retention of such gifts, to avoid  consequences of acceptance, including possible return of the gift to the  donor. Refusal of the gift at the inception should typically be regarded  as in the interest both of the foreign government donor and the U.S.  Government.</p>
