                                Sec. 1.812-3  Computation of loss from operations.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Modification of deductions. A loss from operations is sustained  by a life insurance company in any taxable year, if and to the extent  that, for such year, there is an excess of the sum of the deductions  provided by section 809(d) over the sum of (1) the life insurance  company's share of each and every item of investment yield (including  tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends  received) as determined under section 809(b)(3), and (2) the sum of the  items of gross amount taken into account under section 809(c). In  determining the loss from operations for purposes of section 812:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No deduction shall be allowed under section 812 for the  operations loss deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The 85 percent limitation on dividends received provided by  section 246 (b) as modified by section 809(d)(8)(B) shall not apply to  the deductions otherwise allowed under:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> in respect to dividends received by corporations,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 244 in respect of dividends received on certain  preferred stock of public utilities, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 245 in respect of dividends received from certain  foreign corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Illustration of principles. The application of paragraph (a) of  this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. For the taxable year 1960, X, a life insurance company, has  items taken into account under section 809(c) amounting to $150,000, its  share of the investment yield amounts to $250,000, and total deductions  allowed by section 809(d) of $375,000, exclusive of any operations loss  deduction and exclusive of any deduction for dividends received. In  1960, X received as its share of dividends entitled to the benefits of  section 243(a) the amount of $100,000. These dividends are included in  X's share of the investment yield. X has no other deductions to which  section 812(c) applies. On the basis of these facts, X has a loss from  operations for the taxable year 1960 of $60,000, computed as follows:  Deductions for 1960.........................................    $375,000 Plus: Deduction for dividends received computed without           85,000</p><p class="depth0">regard to the limitation provided by sec. 246(b), as</p><p class="depth0">modified by sec. 809(d)(8)(B) (85% of $100,000)............</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Total deductions as modified by sec. 812(c).............     460,000 Less: Sum of sec. 809(c) items and X's share of investment       400,000</p><p class="depth0">yield (including $100,000 of dividends)....................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Loss from operations for 1960...........................
