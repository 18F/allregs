                            <p class="depth0">Consumable and low value items in inventory (cupboard stocks are not  considered inventory) are subject to accounting and inventory record  controls in accordance with applicable provisions of law and the  principles and standards prescribed by the General Accounting Office, 2  GAO 12.5. Normally, however, the systems of control for such property  cease at the time of issuance from a warehouse or storeroom to the  consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The guidelines set forth in this Sec. 101-25.107 are considered  minimum to assure proper use of consumable or low cost items by  individuals, subsequent to issue from accountable records and  termination of formal accountability. Consumable items, for the purpose  of this section, are considered to include those items actually consumed  in use (e.g., pads and pencils) and those items   required in performance of duties but for which, primarily by reason of  the low value involved, no formal accountability is maintained after  issue, and are generally referred to as ``expendable.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval of requisitions for replenishment of cupboard storeroom  stocks should be restricted to officials at a responsible supervisory  level to ensure that supply requirements are justified on the basis of  essentiality and quantity. Where requisitions are not required, such as  in obtaining items from GSA customer supply centers, informal ``shopping  lists'' should be approved at the same level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adequate safeguards and controls should be established to assure  that issues of expendable supplies are made for official use only. In  appropriate situations, this will include identification of individuals  to whom expendable supplies have been issued. Experience has indicated,  also, that certain items of expendables should not be displayed either  at seasonal periods of the year or on a permanent basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The items listed below have from experience proven to be  personally attractive and particularly susceptible to being used for  other than official duties. Agencies should give special attention to  these and any other consumable or low cost items when issues are  excessive when compared with normal program needs.  Attache cases, Ball point pens and refills, Brief cases, Binders, Carbon  paper, Dictionaries, Felt tip markers, Felt tip pens and refills, File  folders, Letterex, Letter openers, Pads (paper), Paper clips, Pencils,  Pencil sharpeners, Portfolios (leather, plastic, and writing pads),  Rubber bands, Rulers, Scissors, Spray paint and lacquer, Staplers,  Staples, Staple removers, Tape dispensers, Transparent tape, Typewriter  ribbons.
