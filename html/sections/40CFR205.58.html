Defects in design, assembly or in any part, component or system of the vehicle as manufactured by (name of vehicle manufacturer), which, at the time it left (name of vehicle manufacturer)'s control, caused noise emissions to exceed Federal standards, are covered by this warranty for the life of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]

Sec. 205.58-2  Tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For each configuration of vehicles covered by this part, the manufacturer shall develop a list of those acts which, in his judgment, might be done to the vehicle in use and which would constitute the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control devices or elements of design of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer shall include in the owner's manual the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The statement:</p><p class="depth0">Tampering With Noise Control System Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">Federal law prohibits the following acts or the causing thereof:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The removal or rendering inoperative by any person, other than for purposes of maintenance, repair, or replacement, of any device or element of design incorporated into any new vehicle for the purpose of noise control prior to its sale or delivery to the ultimate purchaser or while it is in use; or (2) the use of the vehicle after such device or element of design has been removed or rendered inoperative by any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The statement:</p><p class="depth0">Among those acts presumed to constitute tampering are the acts listed below.

Immediately following this statement, the manufacturer shall include the list developed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any act included in the list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is presumed to constitute tampering; however, in any case in which a proscribed act has been committed and it can be shown that such act resulted in no increase in the noise level of the vehicle or that the vehicle still meets the noise emission standard of Sec. 205.52, such act will not constitute tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this section are not intended to preclude any State or local jurisdiction from adopting and enforcing its own prohibitions against the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control systems on vehicles subject to this part.

Sec. 205.58-3  Instructions for maintenance, use and repair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> The manufacturer shall provide to the ultimate purchaser of each vehicle covered by this subpart written instructions for the proper maintenance,

use and repair of the vehicle in order to provide reasonable assurance of the elimination or minimization of noise emission degradation throughout the life of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer shall provide to the ultimate purchaser of each vehicle covered by this subpart written instructions for the proper maintenance,

use and repair of the vehicle in order to provide reasonable assurance of the elimination or minimization of noise emission degradation throughout the life of the vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of the instructions is to inform purchasers and mechanics of those acts necessary to reasonably assure that degradation of noise emission level is eliminated or minimized during the life of the vehicle. Manufacturers should prepare the instructions with this purpose in mind. The instructions should be clear and, to the extent practicable, written in nontechnical language.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The instructions must not be used to secure an unfair competitive advantage. They should not restrict replacement equipment to original equipment or service to dealer service. Manufacturers who so restrict replacement equipment should be prepared to make public any performance specifications on such equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of encouraging proper maintenance, the manufacturer shall provide a record or log book which shall contain a schedule for the performance of all required noise emission control maintenance. Space shall be provided in this record book so that the purchaser can note what maintenance was done, by whom, where and when.
