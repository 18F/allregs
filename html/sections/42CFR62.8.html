                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of  this section, each participant is obligated to (1) become a member of  the National Health Service Corps employed as a Commissioned Officer in  the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or as a Federal civilian in  the full-time clinical practice of the participant's profession and (2)  serve in the health manpower shortage area to which the participant is  assigned by the National Health Service Corps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beginning of service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The period of obligated service will  begin when the Scholarship Program participant begins to provide  services in the health manpower shortage area to which he or she is  assigned by the Secretary. Except for those participants who receive a  deferral under Sec.  62.9 (a) or (b), this assignment will be made by  the Secretary as soon as possible following: (i) the completion of the  participant's course of study leading to a degree in medicine,  osteopathy, dentistry, or an equivalent credential for a particular  health profession, and (ii) appointment of the participant as a  Commissioned Officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or  as a civilian member of the National Health Service Corps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, ``appointment'' means only those  appointments as Commissioned Officers in the Regular or Reserve Corps of  the Service or as civilian members of the National Health Service Corps  made specifically for the purpose of serving a participant's period of  obligated service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of service. Except as provided in Sec.  62.14(b)(1),  the period for which the Scholarship Program participant is obligated to  serve is equal to 1 year for each school year for which the participant  receives a scholarship award under this part, or 2 years, whichever is  greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service by detail. If the Secretary determines that there is no  need in a health manpower shortage area for a member of the profession  in which the Scholarship Program participant is obligated to provide  service, the Scholarship Program participant may be detailed to serve  the period of obligated service as a full-time member of the profession  for which the participant has been trained, in any unit of the  Department of Health and Human Services as the Secretary may determine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Creditability of approved graduate training. Except as provided  in Sec.  62.14(b)(2), no period of approved graduate training will be  credited toward satisfying the period of obligated service incurred  under the Scholarship Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service under the National Research Service Award Program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A  Scholarship Program participant who demonstrates exceptional promise for  medical research may perform the period of obligated service owed under  this section by participating in the National   Research Service Award Program for individual postdoctoral fellows  authorized under section 472 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptional promise for medical research will be demonstrated if  the participant applies for a National Research Service Award for  individual postdoctoral fellows, is selected to participate in this  research program, and accepts the offer of participation. A Scholarship  Program participant in the National Research Service Award Program will  receive credit toward satisfying the period of obligated service  incurred under this section for any period of time he or she is engaged  in activities which meet the service requirements of the National  Research Service Award Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the time served under the National Research Service Award  Program is less than the total period of obligated service owed under  the Scholarship Program, the participant will serve the remainder of the  Scholarship Program service obligation (i) in activities which meet the  criteria for service under the National Research Service Award Program,  as approved by the Secretary or (ii) as a member of the National Health  Service Corps providing health services in the full-time clinical  practice of his or her health profession. A participant who fails to  begin or complete the service requirements under the National Research  Service Award Program may be subject to the default penalty under Sec.   62.10(c) of this part and the default penalties under the National  Research Service Award Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Release from service obligation to engage in private practice.  The Secretary will release a participant from all or part of the service  obligation if the participant applies for a release under section 753 of  the Act and agrees in writing to engage for a period equal to the  remaining period of the participant's service obligation in the full- time private clinical practice of the participant's health profession,  under the requirements of section 753 of the Act.</p>
