                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Withdrawal. If the FDIC has not approved or denied your pending application within two calendar years after the filing date under Sec. 390.109, the FDIC will notify you, in writing, that your application is deemed withdrawn unless the FDIC determines that you are actively pursuing a final FDIC determination on your application. You are not actively pursuing a final FDIC determination if you have failed to timely take an action required under this part, including filing required additional information, or the FDIC has suspended processing of your application under Sec. 390.132 based on circumstances that are, in whole or in part, within your control and you have failed to take reasonable steps to resolve these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
