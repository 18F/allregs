                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Separation of energetic liquids and determination of distances.  A launch site operator must separate each explosive hazard facility from  each other explosive hazard facility, each public area, and each public  traffic route in accordance with the minimum separation distance  determined under this section for each explosive hazard facility  storing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of greater than 91 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hydrazine;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Liquid hydrogen; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any energetic liquid that is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Incompatible with any of the energetic liquids of paragraph  (a)(1) through (3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stored within an intraline distance of any of them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quantity. For each explosive hazard facility, a launch site  operator must determine the total quantity of all energetic liquids in  paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The quantity of energetic liquid in a tank, drum, cylinder, or  other container is the net weight in pounds of the energetic liquid in  the container. The determination of quantity must include any energetic  liquid in associated piping to any point where positive means exist for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interrupting the flow through the pipe, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Interrupting a reaction in the pipe in the event of a mishap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A launch site operator must convert the quantity of each  energetic liquid from gallons to pounds using the conversion factors  provided in table E-6 of appendix E of this part and the following  equation:  Pounds of energetic liquid = gallons x density of energetic liquid  (pounds per gallon).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where two or more containers of compatible energetic liquids are  stored in the same explosive hazard facility, the total quantity of  energetic liquids is the total quantity of energetic liquids in all  containers, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The containers are each separated from each other by the  distance required by paragraph (c) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The containers are subdivided by intervening barriers that  prevent mixing, such as diking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where two or more containers of incompatible energetic liquids  are stored within an intraline distance of each other, paragraph (d) of  this section applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of separation distances for compatible energetic  liquids. A launch site operator must determine separation distances for  compatible energetic liquids as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To determine each intraline, public area, and public traffic  route distance, a launch site operator must use the following tables in  appendix E of this part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Table E-7 for hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of greater  than 91 percent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Table E-8 for hydrazine and liquid hydrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For liquid hydrogen and hydrazine, a launch site operator must  use the ``intraline distance to compatible energetic liquids'' for the  energetic liquid that requires the greater distance under table E-8 of  appendix E of this part as the minimum separation distance between  compatible energetic liquids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this section unless intervening barriers prevent  mixing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If intervening barriers prevent mixing, a launch site operator  must separate the incompatible energetic liquids by no less than the  intraline distance that tables E-7 and E-8 of appendix E of this part  apply to compatible energetic liquids using the quantity or energetic  liquid requiring the greater separation distance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A launch site operator must use the formulas provided in table  E-5 of appendix E of this part, to determine the explosive equivalent in  pounds of the combined incompatible energetic liquids. A launch site  operator must then use the explosive equivalent in pounds requiring the  greatest separation distance to determine the minimum separation  distance between each explosive hazard facility and all other explosive  hazard facilities and each public area and public traffic route as  required by tables E-1, E-2 and E-3 of appendix E of this part.
