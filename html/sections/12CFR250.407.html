                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board of Governors was asked recently whether section 32 of  the Banking Act of 1933 (``section 32''), 12 U.S.C. 78, prohibits the  interlocking service of X as a director of a member bank of the Federal  Reserve System and as a partner in a New York City brokerage firm  (``Partnership'') having a corporation affiliate (``Corporation'')  engaged in business of the kinds described in section 32 (``section 32  business'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 32, subject to an exception not applicable here,  provides that</p><p class="depth2">No officer, director, or employee of any corporation or  unincorporated association, no partner or employee of any partnership,  and no individual, primarily engaged in the issue, flotation,  underwriting, public sale, or distribution, at wholesale or retail, or  through syndicate participation, of stocks, bonds, or other similar  securities, shall serve the same time as an officer, director, or  employee of any member bank * * *.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> From the information submitted it appears that Partnership, a  member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, is the successor of two  prior partnerships, in one of which X had been a partner. This prior  partnership had been found not to be ``primarily engaged'' in section 32  business. The other prior partnership, however, had been so engaged. By  arrangement between the two prior firms, Corporation was formed chiefly  for the purpose of carrying on the section 32 business of the prior firm  that had been ``primarily engaged'' in that business, which business was  transferred to Corporation. The two prior firms were then merged and the  stock of Corporation was acquired by all the partners of Partnership,  other than X, in proportion to the respective partnership interests of  the stockholding partners. The information submitted indicated also that  two of the three directors and ``some'' of the principal officers of  Corporation are partners in Partnership, although X is not a director or  officer of Corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It is understood that the practice of forming corporate  affiliates of brokerage firms, in order that the affiliate may carry on  the securities business (such as section 32 business) with limited  liability and other advantages, has become rather widespread in recent  years. Accordingly, other cases may arise where a partner in such a firm  may desire to serve at the same time as director of a member bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> On the basis of the information presented the Board concluded  that X in his capacity as an ``individual'', was not engaged in section  32 business. However, as that information showed Corporation to be  ``primarily engaged'' in section 32 business, the Board stated that a  finding that Partnership and Corporation were one entity for the  purposes of the statute would mean that X would be forbidden to serve  both the member bank and Partnership, if the one entity were so engaged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Paragraph .15 of Rule 321 of the New York Stock Exchange  governing the formation and conduct of affiliated   companies of member organizations states that:</p><p class="depth2">Since Rule 314 provides that each member and allied member in a  member organization must have a fixed interest in its entire business,  it follows that the fixed interest of each member and allied member must  extend to the member organization's corporate affiliate. When any of the  corporate affiliate's participating stock is owned by the members and  allied members in the member organization, such holdings must at all  times be distributed among such members and allied members in  approximately the same proportions as their respective interests in the  profits of the member organization. When a member or allied member's  interest in the member organization is changed, a corresponding change  must be made in his participating interest in the affiliate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Although it was understood that X had received special  permission from the Exchange not to own any of the stock of Corporation,  it appeared to the Board that Rule 321.15 would apply to the remaining  partners. Moreover, other paragraphs of the rule forbid transfers of the  stock, except under certain circumstances to limited classes of persons,  such as employees of the organization or estates of decedent partners,  without permission of the Exchange.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The information supplied to the Board clearly indicated that  Corporation was formed in order to provide Partnership with an  ``underwriting arm''. Under Rule 321 of the Exchange, the partners  (other than X) are required to own stock in Corporation because of their  partnership interest, would be required to surrender that stock on  leaving the partnership, and incoming partners would be required to  acquire such stock. Furthermore, Rule 321 speaks of a corporate  affiliate, such as Corporation, as a part of the ``entire business'' of  a member organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> On the basis of the foregoing, the Board concluded that  Partnership and Corporation must be regarded as a single entity or  enterprise for purposes of section 32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The remaining question was whether the enterprise, as a whole,  should be regarded as ``primarily engaged'' in section 32 business. The  Information presented stated that the total dollar volume of section 32  business of Corporation during the first eleven months of its operation  was $89 million. The gross income from section 32 business was less than  half a million, and represented about 7.9 percent of the income of  Partnership. The Board was advised that the relatively low amount of  income from section 32 business of Corporation as due to special costs,  and to the condition of the market for municipal and State bonds during  the past year, a field in which Corporation specializes. Corporation is  listed in a standard directory of securities dealers, and holds itself  out as having separate departments to deal with the principal  underwriting areas in which it functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In view of the above information, the Board concluded that the  enterprise consisting of Partnership and Corporation was ``primarily  engaged'' in section 32 business. Accordingly, the Board stated that the  partners in Partnership, including X, were forbidden by that section and  by this part 218 (Reg. R), issued pursuant to the statute, to serve as  officers, directors, or employees of any member banks.  [29 FR 5315, Apr. 18, 1964. Redesignated at 61 FR 57289, Nov. 6, 1996]</p>
