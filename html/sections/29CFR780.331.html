                                Sec. 780.331  Crew leaders and labor contractors.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whether a crew leader or a labor contractor is the employer of  the workers he supplies is a question of fact. The tests here are the  same as those used to determine whether a sharecropper or tenant is an  independent contractor. A crew leader who merely assembles a crew and  brings them to the farm to be supervised and paid directly by the  farmer, and who does the same work and receives the same pay as the  crewmembers, is an employee of the farmer, and both he and his crew are  counted as such and paid accordingly if the farmer is not exempt under  the 500 man-day test. The situation is not significantly different if  under the same circumstances, the crew is hired at so much per acre for  their work. This is in effect a group piecework arrangement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The situation is different where the farmer only establishes the  general manner for the work to be done. Where this is the case, the  labor contractor is the employer of the workers if he makes the day-to- day decisions regarding the work and has an opportunity for profit or  loss through his supervision of the crew and its output. As the  employer, he has the authority to hire and fire the workers and direct  them while working in the fields. Complaints by the farmer about the  quality or quantity of the work or about a worker are made to the  contractor or his representatives, who takes whatever action he deems  appropriate. His opportunity for profit or loss comes from his control  over the time and manner of performance of work by his crew and his  authority to determine the wage rates paid to his workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There is also the common and general practice of an individual  who performs custom work such as crop dusting or grain harvesting and  threshing or sheepshearing. In the typical case this contractor has a  substantial investment in equipment and his business decisions and  judgments materially affect his opportunity for profit or loss. In the  overall picture, the contractor is not following the usual path of an  employee, but that of an independent contractor.</p><p class="depth2">For example: A sheepshearing contractor who operates in the  following manner is considered an independent contractor and therefore  an agricultural employer in his own right--he operates his own equipment  including power supply from his own trucks or trailers, boards his  shearing crew and has complete responsibility for their work and  compensation, has complete charge of the sheep from the time they enter  the shearing pen until they are shorn and turned out, and contracts with  the rancher for the complete operation at an agreed rate per head.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether or not a labor contractor or crew leader is found to be  a bona   fide independent contractor, his employees are considered jointly  employed by him and the farmer who is using their labor if the farmer  has the power to direct, control or supervise the work, or to determine  the pay rates or method of payment. (Hodgson v. Okada (C.A. 10), 20 W.H.  Cases 1107; Hodgson v. Griffin & Brand (C.A. 5) 20 W.H. Cases 1051;  Mitchell v. Hertzke, 234 F. 2d 183, 12 W.H. Cases 877 (C.A. 10).) In a  joint employment situation, the man-days of agricultural labor rendered  are counted toward the man-days of such labor of each employer. Each  employer is considered equally responsible for compliance with the Act.  With respect to the recordkeeping regulations in 29 CFR 516.33, the  employer who actually pays the employees will be considered primarily  responsible for maintaining and preserving the records of hours worked  and employees' earnings specified in paragraph (c) of Sec. 516.33 of  this chapter.  [37 FR 12084, June 17, 1972, as amended at 38 FR 27521, Oct. 4, 1973]</p>
