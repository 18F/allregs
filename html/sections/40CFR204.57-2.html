                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compressors comprising the batch sample which are required to be  tested pursuant to a test request in accordance with this subpart will  be randomly selected from a batch of compressors of the category or  configuration specified in the test request. The random selection will  be achieved by sequentially numbering all of the compressors in the  batch and then using a table of random numbers to select the number of  compressors, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, based on the  batch size designated by the Administrator in the test request. An  alternative selection plan may be used by a manufacturer: Provided, That  such a plan is approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Acceptable Quality Level is 10 percent. The appropriate  sampling plans associated with the designated AQL are contained in  Appendix I, Table II.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The appropriate batch sample size will be determined by  reference to Appendix I, Tables I and II. A code letter is obtained from  Table I based on the batch size designated by the Administrator in a  test request. The batch sample size will be equal to the maximum  cumulative sample size as listed in Table II for the appropriate code  letter obtained from Table I plus an additional ten percent rounded off  to the next highest number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individual compressors comprising the test sample will be  randomly selected from the batch sample using the same random selection  plan as in paragraph (a) of this section. Test sample size will be  determined by entering Table II.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The test compressor of the category or configuration selected  for testing shall have been assembled by the manufacturer for  distribution in commerce using the manufacturers normal production  process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless otherwise indicated in the test request, the manufacturer  will select the batch sample from the production batch next scheduled  after receipt of the test request of the category or configuration  specified in the test request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unless otherwise indicated in the test request, the manufacturer  shall select the compressors designated in the test request for testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> At their discretion, EPA Enforcement Officers, rather than the  manufacturer, may select the compressors designated in the test request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer will keep on hand all compressors in the batch  sample until such time as the batch is accepted or rejected in  accordance with Sec. 204.57-6; Except, that compressors actually tested  and found to be in conformance with these regulations need not be kept.</p>
