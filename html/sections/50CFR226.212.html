Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the designated stream reaches, and includes a lateral extent as defined by the ordinary high-water line (33 CFR 319.11). In areas where ordinary high-water line has not been defined, the lateral extent will be defined by

the bankfull elevation. Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a discharge which generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on the annual flood series. Critical habitat in lake areas is defined by the perimeter of the water body as displayed on standard 1:24,000 scale topographic maps or the elevation of ordinary high water, whichever is greater. In estuarine and nearshore marine areas critical habitat includes areas contiguous with the shoreline from the line of extreme high water out to a depth no greater than 30 meters relative to mean lower low water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Primary constituent elements. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of these ESUs are those sites and habitat components that support one or more life stages, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Freshwater spawning sites with water quantity and quality conditions and substrate supporting spawning, incubation and larval development;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Freshwater rearing sites with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water quantity and floodplain connectivity to form and maintain physical habitat conditions and support juvenile growth and mobility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Water quality and forage supporting juvenile development; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Natural cover such as shade, submerged and overhanging large wood, log jams and beaver dams, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Freshwater migration corridors free of obstruction and excessive predation with water quantity and quality conditions and natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels, and undercut banks supporting juvenile and adult mobility and survival;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Estuarine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water quality, water quantity, and salinity conditions supporting juvenile and adult physiological transitions between fresh- and saltwater;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, side channels; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Juvenile and adult forage, including aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and maturation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nearshore marine areas free of obstruction and excessive predation with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water quality and quantity conditions and forage, including aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and maturation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Natural cover such as submerged and overhanging large wood, aquatic vegetation, large rocks and boulders, and side channels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Offshore marine areas with water quality conditions and forage, including aquatic invertebrates and fishes, supporting growth and maturation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exclusion of Indian lands. Critical habitat does not include habitat areas on Indian lands. The Indian lands specifically excluded from critical habitat are those defined in the Secretarial Order, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of any Indian tribe;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Land held in trust by the United States for any Indian Tribe or individual subject to restrictions by the United States against alienation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fee lands, either within or outside the reservation boundaries, owned by the tribal government; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fee lands within the reservation boundaries owned by individual Indians.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Land owned or controlled by the Department of Defense.
