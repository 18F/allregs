Animals  treated by such dips should not be slaughtered for food purposes until  the expiration of such period as may be required under the   Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C., Supp. III, 601 et seq.). The  length of this required period shall be specified on each certificate  issued by the APHIS inspector or State inspector who supervises the  dipping with such dips.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Approved proprietary brands of coumaphos (Co-Ral [supreg]), 25  percent wettable powder or flowable form used at a concentration of 0.30  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Approved proprietary brands of organophosphorous insecticides  (Prolate [supreg]) used at a concentration of 0.15 percent to 0.25  percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The dipping bath for lime-sulphur dip must be used at a  temperature of 95[deg] to 105 [deg]F., and must be maintained through  the dipping operation at a concentration of not less than 2 percent of  ``sulphide sulphur'', as indicated by the field test for lime-sulphur  dipping baths approved by the APHIS. \1\ The dipping bath for toxaphene  emulsions must be kept within a temperature range of 40-80 [deg]F., and  at a concentration between 0.50 and 0.60 percent throughout the dipping  operations. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ The field test for lime-sulphur dipping baths is described in  U.S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin 163, for sale by the  Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington,  D.C. 20402, at 5 cents a copy.</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Care must be exercised in dipping animals and in maintaining the  bath at the standard concentration. Detailed instructions will be issued  for the guidance of employees who may be called upon to use them in the  scabies eradication program. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proprietary brands of lime-sulphur or toxaphene dips may be used  in official dipping only after specific permission therefor has been  granted by the Administrator. Before a dip will be specifically approved  as a permitted dip for the eradication of scabies in cattle, the APHIS  \3\ will require that the product be registered under the provisions of  the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (7  U.S.C. 135 et seq.); that is efficacy and stability have been  demonstrated; that trials have been conducted to determine that its  concentration can be maintained and that under actual filed conditions  the dipping of cattle in a bath of definite strength will effectually  eradicate scabies infection without injury to the animals dipped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ Information as to the names of such dips may be obtained from  the APHIS or a APHIS inspector.
