                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description. This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding  capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It recognizes both  the facilities capital that the contractor will employ in contract  performance and the contractor's commitment to improving productivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contract facilities capital estimates. The contracting officer  shall estimate the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed  using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money  factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> for obtaining field  pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form  CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application.  It--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit  objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment). The  procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead  allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities  capital cost of   money and capital employed which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Completion instructions. Complete a DD Form 1861 only after  evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, establishing cost of money  factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete  the form as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if  used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost  proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of- measure must be compatible on all three displays.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by  year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective  and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of  money factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be  incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated  contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the  yearly amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the  applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the  contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract  facilities capital employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Preaward facilities capital applications. To establish cost and  price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of money and capital  employed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cost of Money. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cost Objective. Use the imputed facilities  capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost  objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type  contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even  though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of  contract performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Profit Objective. When measuring the contractor's effort for  the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict  the cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as  part of the cost base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Facilities Capital Employed. Assess and weight the profit  objective for risk associated with facilities capital employed in  accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.404-71-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 has  been annotated to explain the process.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Contractor facilities capital                       Amount          Profit</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>             (2)             (3) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Select a value from the list in paragraph (f) of this subsection  using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (g) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use the allocated facilities capital attributable to land,  buildings, and equipment, as derived in DD Form 1861, Contract  Facilities Capital Cost of Money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the net book value of facilities capital  employed, consider facilities capital that is part of a formal  investment plan if the contractor submits reasonable evidence that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Achievable benefits to DoD will result from the investment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The benefits of the investment are included in the forward  pricing structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the value of intracompany transfers has been included in  Block 20 at cost (i.e., excluding general and administrative (G&A;)  expenses and profit), add to the contractor's allocated facilities  capital, the allocated facilities capital attributable to the buildings  and equipment of those corporate divisions supplying the intracompany  transfers. Do not make this addition if the value of intracompany  transfers has been included in Block 20 at price (i.e., including G&A;  expenses and profit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiply (1) by (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Values: Normal and designated ranges.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Normal</p><p class="depth0">Asset type                  value        Designated range</p><p class="depth0"><em>(percent)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Land................................            0  N/A Buildings...........................            0  N/A Equipment...........................         17.5  10 to 25 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Evaluation criteria. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In evaluating facilities capital  employed, the contracting officer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Should relate the usefulness of the facilities capital to the  goods or services being acquired under the prospective contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Should analyze the productivity improvements and other  anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from the  facilities capital investment, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The economic value of the facilities capital, such as physical  age, undepreciated value, idleness, and expected contribution to future  defense needs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The contractor's level of investment in defense related  facilities as compared with the portion of the contractor's total  business that is derived from DoD; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Should consider any contractual provisions that reduce the  contractor's risk of investment recovery, such as termination protection  clauses and capital investment indemnification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Above normal conditions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer may assign  a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment has  direct, identifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> New investments in state-of-the-art technology that reduce  acquisition cost or yield other tangible benefits such as improved  product quality or accelerated deliveries; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Investments in new equipment for research and development  applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer may assign a value significantly above  normal when there are direct and measurable benefits in efficiency and  significantly reduced acquisition costs on the effort being priced.  Maximum values apply only to those cases where the benefits of the  facilities capital investment are substantially above normal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Below normal conditions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contracting officer may assign  a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has  little benefit to DoD. Indicators are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Allocations of capital apply predominantly to commercial item  lines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Investments are for such things as furniture and fixtures, home  or group level administrative offices, corporate aircraft and hangars,  gymnasiums; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Facilities are old or extensively idle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below  normal when a significant portion of defense manufacturing is done in an  environment characterized by outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive  capital equipment.
