                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria for closeout. A grant will be closed out when HUD  determines, in consultation with the recipient, that the following  criteria have been met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All costs to be paid with CDBG funds have been incurred, with  the exception of closeout costs (e.g., audit costs) and costs resulting  from contingent liabilities described in the closeout agreement pursuant  to paragraph (c) of this section. Contingent liabilities include, but  are not limited to, third-party claims against the recipient, as well as  related administrative costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to activities (such as rehabilitation of privately  owned properties) which are financed by means of escrow accounts, loan  guarantees, or similar mechanisms, the work to be assisted with CDBG  funds (but excluding program income) has actually been completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other responsibilities of the recipient under the grant  agreement and applicable laws and regulations appear to have been  carried out satisfactorily   or there is no further Federal interest in keeping the grant agreement  open for the purpose of securing performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Closeout actions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 90 days of the date it is  determined that the criteria for closeout have been met, the recipient  shall submit to HUD a copy of the final performance and evaluation  report described in 24 CFR part 91. If an acceptable report is not  submitted, an audit of the recipient's grant activities may be conducted  by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based on the information provided in the performance report and  other relevant information, HUD, in consultation with the recipient,  will prepare a closeout agreement in accordance with paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD will cancel any unused portion of the awarded grant, as  shown in the signed grant closeout agreement. Any unused grant funds  disbursed from the U.S. Treasury which are in the possession of the  recipient shall be refunded to HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any costs paid with CDBG funds which were not audited previously  shall be subject to coverage in the recipient's next single audit  performed in accordance with 24 CFR part 44. The recipient may be  required to repay HUD any disallowed costs based on the results of the  audit, or on additional HUD reviews provided for in the closeout  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Closeout agreement. Any obligations remaining as of the date of  the closeout shall be covered by the terms of a closeout agreement. The  agreement shall be prepared by the HUD field office in consultation with  the recipient. The agreement shall identify the grant being closed out,  and include provisions with respect to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of any closeout costs or contingent liabilities  subject to payment with CDBG funds after the closeout agreement is  signed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of any unused grant funds to be canceled by HUD;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of any program income on deposit in financial  institutions at the time the closeout agreement is signed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Description of the recipient's responsibility after closeout  for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance with all program requirements, certifications and  assurances in using program income on deposit at the time the closeout  agreement is signed and in using any other remaining CDBG funds  available for closeout costs and contingent liabilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of real property assisted with CDBG funds in accordance  with the principles described in Sec.  570.505;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compliance with requirements governing program income received  subsequent to grant closeout, as described in Sec.  570.504(b)(4) and  (5); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ensuring that flood insurance coverage for affected property  owners is maintained for the mandatory period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other provisions appropriate to any special circumstances of the  grant closeout, in modification of or in addition to the obligations in  paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. The agreement shall  authorize monitoring by HUD, and shall provide that findings of  noncompliance may be taken into account by HUD, as unsatisfactory  performance of the recipient, in the consideration of any future grant  award under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Status of consolidated plan after closeout. Unless otherwise  provided in a closeout agreement, the Consolidated Plan will remain in  effect after closeout until the expiration of the program year covered  by the last approved consolidated plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination of grant for convenience. Grant assistance provided  under this part may be terminated for convenience in whole or in part  before the completion of the assisted activities, in accordance with the  provisions of 24 CFR 85.44. The recipient shall not incur new  obligations for the terminated portions after the effective date, and  shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. HUD shall  allow full credit to the recipient for those portions of obligations  which could not be canceled and which had been properly incurred by the  recipient in carrying out the activities before the termination. The  closeout policies contained in this section shall apply in such cases,  except where the approved grant is terminated in its entirety.  Responsibility for the environmental review to   be performed under 24 CFR part 50 or 24 CFR part 58, as applicable,  shall be determined as part of the closeout process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Termination for cause. In cases in which the Secretary  terminates the recipient's grant under the authority of subpart O of  this part, or under the terms of the grant agreement, the closeout  policies contained in this section shall apply, except where the  approved grant is cancelled in its entirety. The provisions in 24 CFR  85.43(c) on the effects of termination shall also apply. HUD shall  determine whether an environmental assessment or finding of  inapplicability is required, and if such review is required, HUD shall  perform it in accordance with 24 CFR part 50.
