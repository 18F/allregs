                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> Firearms. You, as a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of firearms, must legibly identify each firearm manufactured or imported as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Firearms. You, as a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of firearms, must legibly identify each firearm manufactured or imported as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped (impressed) or placed on the frame or receiver thereof an individual serial number. The serial number must be placed in a manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed, and must not duplicate any serial number placed by you on any other firearm. For firearms manufactured or imported on and after January 30, 2002, the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the serial number must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch and in a print size no smaller than \1/16\ inch; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> By engraving, casting, stamping (impressing), or otherwise conspicuously placing or causing to be engraved, cast, stamped (impressed) or placed on the frame, receiver, or barrel thereof certain additional information. This information must be placed in a manner not susceptible of being readily

obliterated, altered, or removed. For firearms manufactured or imported on and after January 30, 2002, the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of this information must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch. The additional information includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The model, if such designation has been made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The caliber or gauge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Your name (or recognized abbreviation) and also, when applicable, the name of the foreign manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In the case of a domestically made firearm, the city and State (or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the manufacturer maintain your place of business; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> In the case of an imported firearm, the name of the country in which it was manufactured and the city and State (or recognized abbreviation thereof) where you as the importer maintain your place of business. For additional requirements relating to imported firearms, see Customs regulations at 19 CFR part 134.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Firearm frames or receivers. A firearm frame or receiver that is not a component part of a complete weapon at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you must be identified as required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special markings for semiautomatic assault weapons, effective July 5, 1995. In the case of any semiautomatic assault weapon manufactured after September 13, 1994, you must mark the frame or receiver ``RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT/GOVERNMENT USE ONLY'' or, in the case of weapons manufactured for export, ``FOR EXPORT ONLY,'' in a manner not susceptible of being readily obliterated, altered, or removed. For weapons manufactured or imported on and after January 30, 2002, the engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) of the special markings prescribed in this paragraph (a)(3) must be to a minimum depth of .003 inch.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions. (i) Alternate means of identification. The Director may authorize other means of identification upon receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Destructive devices. In the case of a destructive device, the Director may authorize other means of identifying that weapon upon receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that engraving, casting, or stamping (impressing) such a weapon would be dangerous or impracticable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Machine guns, silencers, and parts. Any part defined as a machine gun, firearm muffler, or firearm silencer in Sec.  478.11, that is not a component part of a complete weapon at the time it is sold, shipped, or otherwise disposed of by you, must be identified as required by this section. The Director may authorize other means of identification of parts defined as machine guns other than frames or receivers and parts defined as mufflers or silencers upon receipt of a letter application from you, submitted in duplicate, showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Measurement of height and depth of markings. The depth of all markings required by this section will be measured from the flat surface of the metal and not the peaks or ridges. The height of serial numbers required by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section will be measured as the distance between the latitudinal ends of the character impression bottoms (bases).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Armor piercing ammunition--(1) Marking of ammunition. Each licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of armor piercing ammunition shall identify such ammunition by means of painting, staining or dying the exterior of the projectile with an opaque black coloring. This coloring must completely cover the point of the projectile and at least 50 percent of that portion of the projectile which is visible when the projectile is loaded into a cartridge case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Labeling of packages. Each licensed manufacturer or licensed importer of armor piercing ammunition shall clearly and conspicuously label each package in which armor piercing ammunition is contained, e.g., each box, carton, case, or other container. The label shall include the words ``ARMOR PIERCING'' in block letters at least \1/4\ inch in height. The lettering shall be

located on the exterior surface of the package which contains information concerning the caliber or gauge of the ammunition. There shall also be placed on the same surface of the package in block lettering at least \1/8\ inch in height the words ``FOR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR EXPORTATION ONLY.'' The statements required by this subparagraph shall be on a contrasting background.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Large capacity ammunition feeding devices manufactured after September 13, 1994. (1) Each person who manufactures or imports any large capacity ammunition feeding device manufactured after September 13, 1994, shall legibly identify each such device with a serial number. Such person may use the same serial number for all large capacity ammunition feeding devices produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additionally, in the case of a domestically made large capacity ammunition feeding device, such device shall be marked with the name, city and State (or recognized abbreviation thereof) of the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> And in the case of an imported large capacity ammunition feeding device, such device shall be marked:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With the name of the manufacturer, country of origin, and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Effective July 5, 1995, the name, city and State (or recognized abbreviation thereof) of the importer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Further, large capacity ammunition feeding devices manufactured after September 13, 1994, shall be marked ``RESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT/GOVERNMENT USE ONLY'' or, in the case of devices manufactured or imported for export, effective July 5, 1995, ``FOR EXPORT ONLY.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All markings required by this paragraph (c) shall be cast, stamped, or engraved on the exterior of the device. In the case of a magazine, the markings shall be placed on the magazine body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions--(i) Metallic links. Persons who manufacture or import metallic links for use in the assembly of belted ammunition are only required to place the identification marks prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on the containers used for the packaging of the links.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternate means of identification. The Director may authorize other means of identifying large capacity ammunition feeding devices upon receipt of a letter application, in duplicate, from the manufacturer or importer showing that such other identification is reasonable and will not hinder the effective administration of this part.
