However, any reference to unpublished information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or part be subject to release to the public) in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If nonclinical laboratory studies accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with respect to each nonclinical study included with the application, either a statement that the study has been, or will be, conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of chapter 1, title 21, or, if any such study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If clinical investigations accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with respect to each clinical investigation included with the application, either a statement that the investigation was conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in part 56 of chapter 1, title 21, or was not subject to such requirements in accordance with Sec. 56.194 or Sec. 56.105, and that it was conducted in compliance with the requirements for informed consents set forth in part 50 of chapter 1, title 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The data specified under this section to accompany a labeling application shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified.

The statement shall address why the use of the term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement

shall provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of products on which the claim will be used. The statement shall also specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the product must be met for the appropriate use of the term in labels or labeling, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A detailed explanation supported by any necessary data of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and scientific data sufficient for such purpose, and data and information to the extent necessary to demonstrate that consumers can be expected to understand the meaning of the term under the proposed conditions of use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Analytical data that demonstrates the amount of the nutrient that is present in the products for which the claim is intended.
