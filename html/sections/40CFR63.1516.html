                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan/reports. The owner or operator must develop a written plan as described in Sec. 63.6(e)(3) that contains specific procedures to be followed for operating and maintaining the source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with the standard. The owner or operator shall also keep records of each event as required by Sec. 63.10(b) and record and report if an action taken during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction is not consistent with the procedures in the plan as described in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). In addition to the information required in Sec. 63.6(e)(3), the plan must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedures to determine and record the cause of the malfunction and the time the malfunction began and ended; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corrective actions to be taken in the event of a malfunction of a process or control device, including procedures for recording the actions taken to correct the malfunction or minimize emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excess emissions/summary report. The owner or operator must submit semiannual reports according to the requirements in Sec. 63.10(e)(3). Except, the

owner or operator must submit the semiannual reports within 60 days after the end of each 6-month period instead of within 30 days after the calendar half as specified in Sec. 63.10(e)(3)(v). When no deviations of parameters have occurred, the owner or operator must submit a report stating that no excess emissions occurred during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A report must be submitted if any of these conditions occur during a 6-month reporting period:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The corrective action specified in the OM&M; plan for a bag leak detection system alarm was not initiated within 1 hour.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corrective action specified in the OM&M; plan for a continuous opacity monitoring deviation was not initiated within 1 hour.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The corrective action specified in the OM&M; plan for visible emissions from an aluminum scrap shredder was not initiated within 1 hour.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An excursion of a compliant process or operating parameter value or range (e.g., lime injection rate or screw feeder setting, total reactive chlorine flux injection rate, afterburner operating temperature, fabric filter inlet temperature, definition of acceptable scrap, or other approved operating parameter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An action taken during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction was not consistent with the procedures in the plan as described in Sec. 63.6(e)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> An affected source (including an emission unit in a secondary aluminum processing unit) was not operated according to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A deviation from the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emission limit for a secondary aluminum processing unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each report must include each of these certifications, as applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each thermal chip dryer: ``Only unpainted aluminum chips were used as feedstock in any thermal chip dryer during this reporting period.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each dross-only furnace: ``Only dross and salt flux were used as the charge materials in any dross-only furnace during this reporting period.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For each sidewell group 1 furnace with add-on air pollution control devices: ``Each furnace was operated such that the level of molten metal remained above the top of the passage between the sidewell and hearth during reactive fluxing, and reactive flux, except for cover flux, was added only to the sidewell or to a furnace hearth equipped with an add-on air pollution control device for PM, HCl, and D/F emissions during this reporting period.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each group 1 melting/holding furnace without add-on air pollution control devices and using pollution prevention measures that processes only clean charge material: ``Each group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices subject to emission limits in Sec. 63.1505(i)(2) processed only clean charge during this reporting period.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For each group 2 furnace: ``Only clean charge materials were processed in any group 2 furnace during this reporting period, and no fluxing was performed or all fluxing performed was conducted using only nonreactive, non-HAP-containing/non-HAP-generating fluxing gases or agents, except for cover fluxes, during this reporting period.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For each in-line fluxer using no reactive flux: ``Only nonreactive, non-HAP-containing, non-HAP-generating flux gases, agents, or materials were used at any time during this reporting period.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator must submit the results of any performance test conducted during the reporting period, including one complete report documenting test methods and procedures, process operation, and monitoring parameter ranges or values for each test method used for a particular type of emission point tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual compliance certifications. For the purpose of annual certifications of compliance required by 40 CFR part 70 or 71, the owner or operator must certify continuing compliance based upon, but not limited to, the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any period of excess emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that occurred during the year were reported as required by this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements were met during the year.
