                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified U.S. person ownership test--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A  foreign corporation satisfies the qualified U.S. person ownership test  only if the following two conditions are satisfied concurrently during  more than half the days in its taxable year:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation  (within the meaning of section 957(a)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One or more qualified U.S. persons own more than 50 percent of  the total value of all the outstanding stock of the foreign corporation  (within the meaning of section 958(a) and paragraph (b)(4) of this  section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section, and the  controlled foreign corporation meets the reporting requirements of  paragraph (d) of this section with respect to that person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)(G)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> to such person, be  treated as actually owned by such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the qualified U.S.  person ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Ship Co is a controlled foreign corporation (within the  meaning of section 957(a)) for more than half the days of its taxable  year and is organized in a qualified foreign country. A domestic  partnership owns all of the outstanding stock of Ship Co for the entire  taxable year. All of the partners in the domestic partnership are  residents of foreign countries and not citizens of the United States.  Ship Co does not satisfy the qualified U.S. person ownership test of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section because qualified U.S. persons do not  own shares of Ship Co stock with a value that is greater than 50 percent  of the total value of the outstanding stock of the corporation for at  least half the days of Ship Co's taxable year. Therefore, to satisfy the  stock ownership test of Sec. 1.883-1(c)(2) and constitute a qualified  foreign corporation, Ship Co must meet the qualified shareholder stock  ownership test of Sec. 1.883-4(a).</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Ship Co is a controlled foreign corporation (within the  meaning of section 957(a)) for more than half the days of its taxable  year and is organized in a qualified foreign country. Ship Co has a  single class of stock outstanding. For Ship Co's entire taxable year, a  foreign corporation (Corp A), that is wholly owned by a resident of a  foreign country who is not a U.S. citizen, owns 40 percent of the  outstanding Ship Co stock. During that same period, a domestic  partnership owns the remaining 60 percent of the outstanding Ship Co  stock. The domestic partnership is wholly owned by 20 United States  citizens, each of whom owns a 5-percent partnership interest for Ship  Co's entire taxable year. Ship Co meets the qualified U.S. person  ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section because during more  than half the days in its taxable year it was a controlled foreign  corporation within the meaning of section 957(a), and, applying the  ownership attribution rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section,  qualified U.S. persons (the partners in the domestic partnership) owned  Ship Co stock with a value that is greater than 50 percent of the total  value of all the outstanding Ship Co shares. Therefore, Ship Co will  meet the stock ownership test of Sec. 1.883-1(c)(2) if it satisfies the  substantiation and reporting requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of  this section with respect to the partners in the domestic partnership.  Alternatively, if four or more partners in the domestic partnership were  not qualified U.S. persons, Ship Co would not meet the qualified U.S.  person ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section because, even  though during more than half the days in its taxable year it would have  been a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section  957(a), qualified U.S. persons would not have owned Ship Co stock with a  value that is greater than 50 percent of the total value of all the  outstanding Ship Co shares during that period.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Ship Co is a controlled foreign corporation (within the  meaning of section 957(a)) and is organized in a qualified foreign  country. Ship Co has two classes of stock outstanding, Class A  representing 60 percent of the vote and value and Class B representing  the remaining 40 percent of the vote and value of all the shares  outstanding   of Ship Co. The Class A stock is issued in bearer form and is maintained  in a dematerialized book-entry system, as described in Sec. 1.883- 1(c)(3)(i)(G). The Class B stock is also issued in bearer form, but is  not maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system. For  Ship Co's entire taxable year, a United States citizen A holds all the  Class A stock and nonresident alien individual B owns all the Class B  stock. Although the Class A stock is issued in bearer form, Ship Co will  satisfy the qualified U.S. person ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of  this section because the Class A stock is maintained in a dematerialized  book-entry system on behalf of A. The Class B stock is not owned by a  qualified U.S. person but is taken into account in determining the total  value of Ship Co's outstanding stock. Alternatively, if the Class B  stock were owned by a qualified U.S. person, the results would be  similar. Class B stock would not be taken into account in determining if  the qualified U.S. person ownership test were satisfied, but would be  taken into account in determining the total value of Ship Co's  outstanding stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Substantiation of CFC stock ownership--(1) In general. A  controlled foreign corporation must establish all of the facts necessary  to demonstrate to the Commissioner that it satisfies the qualified U.S.  person ownership test of paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section by obtaining a  written ownership statement (described in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of  this section, as applicable), signed under penalties of perjury by an  individual authorized to sign that person's Federal tax or information  return, from--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each qualified U.S. person whose ownership of stock of the  controlled foreign corporation is taken into account for purposes of  meeting the qualified U.S. person ownership test; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each domestic intermediary described in paragraph (b)(4) of  this section, each foreign intermediary (including a foreign  corporation, partnership, trust, or estate), and mere legal owners or  record holders acting as nominees in the chain of ownership between each  such qualified U.S. person and the controlled foreign corporation, if  any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ownership statements from qualified U.S. persons.

The  foreign corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status must  retain the ownership statements described in this paragraph (c) until  the expiration of the statute of limitations for its taxable year to  which the ownership statements relate. The ownership statements must be  made available for inspection at such time and place as the Commissioner  may request in writing in accordance with Sec. 1.883-1(c)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting requirements.
