                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Burden and standard of proof. The burden of proof is on the  applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she  is eligible for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation  of removal and that discretion should be exercised to grant relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of continuous physical presence and certain breaks  in presence. For purposes of calculating continuous physical presence  under this section, section 309(c)(5)(A) of IIRIRA and section  240A(d)(1) of the Act shall not apply to persons described in Sec.  1240.61. For purposes of this subpart H, a single absence of 90 days or  less or absences which in the aggregate total no more than 180 days  shall be considered brief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For applications for suspension of deportation made under former  section 244 of the Act, as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, the burden  of proof is on the applicant to establish that any breaks in continuous  physical presence were brief, casual, and innocent and did not  meaningfully interrupt the period of continuous physical presence in the  United States. For purposes of evaluating whether an absence is brief,  single absences in excess of 90 days, or absences that total more than  180 days in the aggregate will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. An  applicant must establish that any absence from the United States was  casual and innocent and did not meaningfully interrupt the period of  continuous physical presence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For applications for special rule cancellation of removal made  under section 309(f)(1) of IIRIRA, as amended by NACARA, the applicant  shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical  presence in the United States if he or she has departed from the United  States for any period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the  aggregate exceeding 180 days. The applicant must establish that any  period of absence less than 90 days was casual and innocent and did not  meaningfully interrupt the period of continuous physical presence in the  United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For all applications made under this subpart, a period of  continuous physical presence is terminated whenever an alien is removed  from the United States under an order issued pursuant to any provision  of the Act or the alien has voluntarily departed under the threat of  deportation or when the departure is made for purposes of committing an  unlawful act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirements of continuous physical presence in the United  States under this subpart shall not apply to an alien who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has served for a minimum period of 24 months in an active-duty  status in the Armed Forces of the United States and, if separated from  such service, was separated under honorable conditions, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the alien's enlistment or induction, was in the  United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Factors relevant to extreme hardship. Except as described in  paragraph (d) of this section, extreme hardship shall be determined as  set forth in Sec. 1240.58.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rebuttable presumption of extreme hardship for certain classes  of aliens--(1) Presumption of extreme hardship. An applicant described  in paragraphs (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (a)(2) of Sec. 1240.61 who has submitted a  completed Form I-881 or Form EOIR-40 to either the Service or the  Immigration Court, in accordance with Sec. 1240.63, shall be presumed  to have established that deportation or removal from the United States  would result in extreme hardship to the applicant or to his or her  spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an  alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rebuttal of presumption. A presumption of extreme hardship as  described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be rebutted if the  evidence in the record establishes that it is more likely than not that  neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would suffer extreme  hardship if the applicant were deported or removed from the   United States. In making such a determination, the adjudicator shall  consider relevant factors, including those listed in Sec. 1240.58.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Burden of proof. In those cases where a presumption of extreme  hardship applies, the burden of proof shall be on the Service to  establish that it is more likely than not that neither the applicant nor  a qualified relative would suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were  deported or removed from the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effect of rebuttal. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A determination that it is more likely  than not that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would  suffer extreme hardship if the applicant were deported or removed from  the United States shall be grounds for referral to the Immigration Court  or dismissal of an application submitted initially to the Service. The  applicant is entitled to a de novo adjudication and will again be  considered to have a presumption of extreme hardship before the  Immigration Court.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Immigration Court determines that extreme hardship will  not result from deportation or removal from the United States, the  application will be denied.
