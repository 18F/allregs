A locomotive that is equipped with auxiliary external  lights in conformance with the specifications or performance standards  set forth in paragraph (b) of this section on the date of issuance of a  final rule that requires additional or other external lights on  locomotives for improved conspicuity, as required by section 202(u) of  the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, shall be deemed to conform to  the requirements of the final rule for four years following the date of  issuance of that final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each qualifying arrangement of auxiliary external lights shall  conform to one of the following descriptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Strobe lights. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Strobe lights shall consist of two white  stroboscopic lights, each with ``effective intensity,'' as defined by  the Illuminating Engineering Society's Guide for Calculating the  Effective Intensity of Flashing Signal Lights (November 1964), of at  least 500 candela.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The flash rate of strobe lights shall be at least 40 flashes  per minute and at most 180 flashes per minute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Strobe lights shall be placed at the front of the locomotive,  at least 48 inches apart, and at least 36 inches above the top of the  rail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oscillating light. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An oscillating light shall consist of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> One steadily burning white light producing at least 200,000  candela in a moving beam that depicts a circle or a horizontal figure  ``8'' to the front, about the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive;  or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Two or more white lights producing at least 200,000 candela  each, at one location on the front of the locomotive, that flash  alternately with beams within five degrees horizontally to either side  of the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An oscillating light may incorporate a device that  automatically extinguishes the white light if display of a light of  another color is required to protect the safety of railroad operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Crossing lights. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Crossing lights shall consist of two white  lights, placed at the front of the locomotive, at least 36 inches above  the top of the rail.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Crossing lights shall be spaced at least 36 inches apart if the  vertical distance from the headlight to the horizontal axis of the ditch  lights is 60 inches or more.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Crossing lights shall be spaced at least 60 inches apart if  the vertical distance from the headlight to the horizontal axis of the  ditch lights is less than 60 inches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Each crossing light shall produce at least 200,000 candela,  either steadily burning or alternately flashing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The flash rate of crossing lights shall be at least 40 flashes  per minute and at most 180 flashes per minute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Crossing lights shall be focused horizontally within 15 degrees  of the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Oscillating light. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An oscillating light shall consist of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> One steadily burning white light producing at least 200,000  candela in a moving beam that depicts a circle or a horizontal figure  ``8'' to the front, about the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive;  or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Two or more white lights producing at least 200,000 candela  each, at one location on the front of the locomotive, that flash  alternately with beams within five degrees horizontally to either side  of the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An oscillating light may incorporate a device that  automatically extinguishes the white light if display of a light of  another color is required to protect the safety of railroad operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Any lead locomotive equipped with oscillating lights as  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that were ordered for  installation on that locomotive prior to January 1, 1996, is considered  in compliance with Sec. 229.125(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any lead locomotive equipped with strobe lights as described in  paragraph (b)(1) and operated at speeds no greater than 40 miles per  hour, is considered in compliance with Sec. 229.125(d)(1) through (3)  until the locomotive is retired or rebuilt, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> until the locomotive is  retired or rebuilt, whichever comes first.
