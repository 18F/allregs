Further, issuance of supplementary  instructions by DON activities, deemed essential to the accommodation of  perceived requirements peculiar to those activities, may not conflict.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FOIA applies to ``records'' maintained by ``agencies''  within the Executive Branch of the Federal government, including the  Executive Office of the President and independent regulatory agencies.  It states that ``any person'' (U.S. citizen; foreigner, whether living  inside or outside the United States; partnerships; corporations;  associations; and foreign and domestic governments) has the right  enforceable by law, to access Federal agency records, except to the  extent that such records (or portions thereof) are protected from  disclosure by one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions or one of three  special law enforcement exclusions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Neither Federal agencies nor fugitives from justice may use the  FOIA to access agency records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department of Defense (DoD) FOIA directive states that the  FOIA programs of the U.S. Atlantic Command and the U.S. Pacific Command   fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and not the  Department of the Navy. This policy represents an exception to the  policies directed under DoD Directive 5100.3, ``Support of the  Headquarters of Unified, Specified, and Subordinate Commands.''</p>
