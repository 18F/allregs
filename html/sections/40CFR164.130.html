Because of the extensive notice and hearing opportunities mandated by FIFRA and the Administrative Procedures Act before a final cancellation or suspension order may be issued, EPA has determined that such orders may not be reversed or modified without affording interested parties--who may in fact have participated in lengthy cancellation proceedings--similar notice and hearing opportunities. The procedures set forth in this subpart D shall govern all such applications.</p>
