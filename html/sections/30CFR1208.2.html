For onshore leases, the delivery point will be on or adjacent to the lease, except as provided in Sec. 1208.8(a) of this part. In instances where an onshore delivery point is designated for offshore royalty oil, such point generally will be the first onshore point where the price of the oil, including transportation costs, can be determined and where the purchaser can either exchange or take delivery of the oil.

A refiner that, together with all persons controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or otherwise affiliated with the refiner, inputs a volume of domestic crude oil from its own production exceeding 30 percent of its total refinery input of crude oil is ineligible to participate in royalty oil sales under this part.
