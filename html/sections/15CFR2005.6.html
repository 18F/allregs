                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individuals wishing to request a review of the decision by STR with regard to an initial request to amend a record in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 2005.5, should submit the request for review in writing and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in Sec. 2005.5(a). Individuals desiring assistance in the preparation of their request for review should contact the Administrative Officer at the address provided herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request for review should contain a brief description of the record involved or in lieu thereof, copies of the correspondence from STR in which the request to amend was denied and also the reasons why the individual believes that the disputed information should be amended. The request for review should make reference to the information furnished by the individual in support of his claim and the reasons, as required by Sec. 2005.5, set forth by STR in its decision denying the amendment. Appeals filed without a complete statement by the person making the request setting forth the reasons for the review will, of course, be processed. However, in order to make the appellate process as meaningful as possible, such person's disagreement should be understandably set forth. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, STR reserves the right to dispose of the material concerning the request to amend a record if no request for review in accordance with this section is received by STR within 180 days of the mailing by STR of its decision upon an initial request. A request for review received after the 180 day period may, at the discretion of the Administrative Officer, be treated as an initial request to amend a record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request for review should be addressed to the Freedom of Information Appeals Committee (established in 15 CFR 2004.7) Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, room 719, 1800 G St. NW., Washington, DC 20506.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final determinations on requests for reviews within STR will be made by the Freedom of Information Appeals Committee, chaired by the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations. Additional information may be requested by the Committee from the person requesting a review if necessary to make a determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The FOI Appeals Committee will inform the person making the request in writing of the decision on the request for review within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) from the date of receipt by STR of the individual's request for review, unless the Committee extends

the 30 day period for good cause. The extension and the reasons therefor will be sent by STR to the individual within the initial 30 day period. Included in the notice of a decision being reviewed, if the decision does not grant in full the request for review, will be a description of the steps the individual may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision, and a statement that the individual may file a concise statement with STR setting forth the individual's reasons for his disagreement with the decision upon the request for review. The STR Administrative Officer has the authority to determine the ``conciseness'' of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues. Upon the filing of a proper concise statement by the individual, any subsequent disclosure of the information in dispute will have the information in dispute clearly noted and a copy of the concise statement furnished, setting forth its reasons for not making the requested changes, if STR chooses to file such a statement. A copy of the individual's statement, and if it chooses, STR's statement, will be sent to any prior transferee of the disputed information who is listed on the accounting required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(c).</p>
