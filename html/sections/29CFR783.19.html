                            <p class="depth0">Under amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act effective September  3, 1961, employees not covered by reason of their personal engagement in  interstate commerce activites, as explained in Sec. 783.18, are  nevertheless brought within the coverage of the Act if they are employed  in an enterprise which is defined in section 3(s) of the Act as an  enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for  commerce, or by an establishment described in section 3(s)(3) of the Act  (see Sec. 783.11). Such employees, if not exempt from the minimum wage  and overtime pay requirements under section 13(a)(14) or exempt from the  overtime pay requirements under section 13(b)(6), will have to be paid  in accordance with those monetary standards of the Act unless expressly  exempt under some other   provision. This would generally be true of employees employed in  enterprises and by establishments engaged in a business concerned with  transportation of goods or persons by vessels, where the enterprise has  an annual gross sales volume of $1,000,000 or more. Enterprise coverage  is more fully discussed in part 776 of this chapter, dealing with  general coverage.</p>
