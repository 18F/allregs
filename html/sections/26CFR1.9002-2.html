                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act has not been exercised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> provides that the year of change is the earlier of (1) the  first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959, or (2) the earliest  taxable year for which, on or before June 22, 1959,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> There was issued a notice of deficiency or written notice of a  proposed deficiency attributable to the erroneous treatment of dealer  reserve income, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer filed a claim for refund or credit with respect to  the treatment of such income,   and in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency, or the refund  or credit of any overpayment, was not prevented on June 21, 1959, by the  operation of any law or rule of law. The written notice of proposed  deficiency includes a 15- or 30-day letter issued under established  procedure or other similar written notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application to pre-1954 Code years. If the earliest year  described in paragraph (b) of this section is a year subject to the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939 in respect of which assessment of any  deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment was not prevented on  June 21, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law, section 481  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be treated as applying in the  same manner it would have applied had it been enacted as part of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The operation of this section in determining the year  of change may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. D, a taxpayer on the calendar year basis who employs the  accrual method of accounting, voluntarily changed to the proper method  of accounting for dealer reserve income for the taxable year 1959. A  statutory notice of deficiency, however, was issued prior to June 23,  1959, relating to the erroneous treatment of such income for the taxable  year 1956, which was the earliest taxable year in respect of which  assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment was not  prevented on June 21, 1959. Prior to September 1, 1960, D properly  exercises his election under section 3 of the Act to have the change in  the treatment of dealer reserve income treated as a change in method of  accounting not initiated by the taxpayer to which section 481 of the  Code applies. Under these facts, 1956 is the year of the change for  purposes of applying section 481. Accordingly, the net amount of any  adjustment found necessary as a result of the change in the treatment of  dealer reserve income which is attributable to taxable years subject to  the 1954 Code shall be taken into account for the year of change in  accordance with section 481. The net amount of the adjustments  attributable to pre-1954 Code years is to be disregarded. The income of  each taxable year succeeding the year of change in respect of which the  assessment of any deficiency or refund or credit of any overpayment is  not prevented will be recomputed under the proper method of accounting  initiated by the change.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as set forth in example (1), except  that no notice of a proposed deficiency of any type has been issued, and  assume further that no claim for refund has been filed. Since there was  no earlier year open on June 21, 1959, for which the taxpayer either was  notified of a proposed deficiency attributable to the erroneous  treatment of dealer reserve income or for which he had filed a claim for  refund or credit with respect to the treatment of such income, the year  of change is 1959, the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959.  Accordingly, the net amount of any adjustment found necessary as a  result of the change in the treatment of dealer reserve income which is  attributable to taxable years subject to the 1954 Code shall be taken  into account for the year of the change in accordance with section 481.  The net amount of the adjustments attributable to pre-1954 Code years is  to be disregarded.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as set forth in example (1), except  that a refund   claim specifying adjustments relative to dealer reserve income was  timely filed for the taxable year 1951, which was the earliest taxable  year for which a refund or credit of an overpayment or assessment of a  deficiency was not prevented on June 21, 1959. Under this factual  situation, the year of change for purposes of applying section 481 would  be 1951. Section 481 would be applied to 1951 and be given effect for  that year in the same manner as it would have applied had it been  enacted as a part of the 1939 Code and as if the change to the proper  method of accounting had not been initiated by the taxpayer. Any  adjustment with regard to dealer reserve income attributable to pre-1951  years is disregarded. The income of each taxable year succeeding the  year of change in respect of which the assessment of any deficiency or  refund or credit of any overpayment is not prevented will be recomputed  under the proper method of accounting initiated by the change.
