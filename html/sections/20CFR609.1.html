                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Subchapter I of chapter 85, title 5 of the United  States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-566, 90 Stat. 2667, 5 U.S.C. 8501- 8508, provides for a permanent program of unemployment compensation for  unemployed Federal civilian employees. The unemployment compensation  provided for in subchapter I is hereinafter referred to as unemployment  compensation for Federal employees, or UCFE. The regulations in this  part are issued to implement the UCFE Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> First rule of construction. The Act and the implementing  regulations in this part shall be construed liberally so as to carry out  the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Second rule of construction. The Act and the implementing  regulations in this part shall be construed so as to assure insofar as  possible the uniform interpretation and application of the Act  throughout the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effectuating purpose and rules of construction. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to  effectuate the provisions of this section, each State agency shall  forward to the United States Department of Labor (hereafter Department),  not later than 10 days after issuance, a copy of each judicial or  administrative decision ruling on an individual's entitlement to payment  of UCFE or to credit for a waiting period. On request of the Department,  a State agency shall forward to the Department a copy of any  determination or redetermination ruling on   an individual's entitlement to UCFE or waiting period credit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Department believes that a determination,  redetermination, or decision is inconsistent with the Department's  interpretation of the Act or this part, the Department may at any time  notify the State agency of the Department's view. Thereafter the State  agency shall issue a redetermination or appeal if possible, and shall  not follow such determination, redetermination, or decision as a  precedent; and, in any subsequent proceedings which involve such  determination, redetermination, or decision, or wherein such  determination, redetermination, or decision is cited as precedent or  otherwise relied upon, the State agency shall inform the claims deputy  or hearing officer or court of the Department's view and shall make all  reasonable efforts, including appeal or other proceedings in an  appropriate forum, to obtain modification, limitation, or overruling of  the determination, redetermination, or decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Department believes that a determination,  redetermination, or decision is patently and flagrantly violative of the  Act or this part, the Department may at any time notify the State agency  of the Department's view. If the determination, redetermination, or  decision in question denies UCFE to a claimant, the steps outlined in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be followed by the State agency.  If the determination, redetermination, or decision in question awards  UCFE to a claimant, the benefits are ``due'' within the meaning of  section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1), and  therefore must be paid promptly to the claimant. However, the State  agency shall take the steps outlined in paragraph (d)(2) of this  section, and payments to the claimant may be temporarily delayed if  redetermination or appeal action is taken not more than one business day  following the day on which the first payment otherwise would be issued  to the claimant; and the redetermination action is taken or appeal is  filed to obtain a reversal of the award of UCFE and a ruling consistent  with the Department's view; and the redetermination action or appeal  seeks an expedited redetermination or appeal within not more than two  weeks after the redetermination action is taken or the appeal is filed.  If redetermination action is not taken or appeal is not filed within the  above time limit, or a redetermination or decision is not obtained  within the two-week limit, or any redetermination or decision or order  is issued which affirms the determination, redetermination, or decision  awarding UCFE or allows it to stand in whole or in part, the benefits  awarded must be paid promptly to the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If any determination, redetermination, or decision, referred  to in paragraph (d)(2) or paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is treated  as a precedent for any future UCFE claim or claim under the UCX Program  (part 614 of this chapter), the Secretary will decide whether the  Agreement with the State entered into under the Act shall be terminated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of any determination, redetermination, or decision  that is not legally warranted under the Act or this part, including any  determination, redetermination, or decision referred to in paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, the Secretary will decide whether the State  shall be required to restore the funds of the United States for any sums  paid under such a determination, redetermination, or decision, and  whether, in the absence of such restoration, the Agreement with the  State shall be terminated and whether other action shall be taken to  recover such sums for the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A State agency may request reconsideration of a notice issued  pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and  shall be given an opportunity to present views and arguments if desired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Concurrence of the Department in a determination,  redetermination, or decision shall not be presumed from the absence of a  notice issued pursuant to this section.</p>
