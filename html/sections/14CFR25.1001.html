                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A fuel jettisoning system must be installed on each airplane unless it is shown that the airplane meets the climb requirements of Sec. Sec. 25.119 and 25.121(d) at maximum takeoff weight, less the actual or computed weight of fuel necessary for a 15-minute flight comprised of a takeoff, go-around, and landing at the airport of departure with the airplane configuration, speed, power, and thrust the same as that used in meeting the applicable takeoff, approach, and landing climb performance requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a fuel jettisoning system is required it must be capable of jettisoning enough fuel within 15 minutes, starting with the weight given in paragraph (a) of this section, to enable the airplane to meet the climb requirements of Sec. Sec. 25.119 and 25.121(d), assuming that the fuel is jettisoned under the conditions, except weight, found least favorable during the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuel jettisoning must be demonstrated beginning at maximum takeoff weight with flaps and landing gear up and in--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A power-off glide at 1.3 VSR1;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A climb at the one-engine inoperative best rate-of-climb speed, with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines at maximum continuous power; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Level flight at 1.3 V SR1; if the results of the tests in the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section show that this condition could be critical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the flight tests prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, it must be shown that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fuel jettisoning system and its operation are free from fire hazard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fuel discharges clear of any part of the airplane;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel or fumes do not enter any parts of the airplane; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The jettisoning operation does not adversely affect the controllability of the airplane.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, means must be provided to prevent jettisoning the fuel in the tanks used for takeoff and landing below the level allowing 45 minutes

flight at 75 percent maximum continuous power. However, if there is an auxiliary control independent of the main jettisoning control, the system may be designed to jettison the remaining fuel by means of the auxiliary jettisoning control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For turbine engine powered airplanes, means must be provided to prevent jettisoning the fuel in the tanks used for takeoff and landing below the level allowing climb from sea level to 10,000 feet and thereafter allowing 45 minutes cruise at a speed for maximum range. However, if there is an auxiliary control independent of the main jettisoning control, the system may be designed to jettison the remaining fuel by means of the auxiliary jettisoning control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The fuel jettisoning valve must be designed to allow flight personnel to close the valve during any part of the jettisoning operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Unless it is shown that using any means (including flaps, slots, and slats) for changing the airflow across or around the wings does not adversely affect fuel jettisoning, there must be a placard, adjacent to the jettisoning control, to warn flight crewmembers against jettisoning fuel while the means that change the airflow are being used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The fuel jettisoning system must be designed so that any reasonably probable single malfunction in the system will not result in a hazardous condition due to unsymmetrical jettisoning of, or inability to jettison, fuel.
