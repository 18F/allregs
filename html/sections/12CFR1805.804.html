                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Data--General. An Awardee (and a Community Partner, if appropriate) shall maintain such records as may be prescribed by the Fund that are necessary to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclose the manner in which Fund assistance is used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this part and an Assistance Agreement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evaluate the impact of the CDFI Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Customer profiles. An Awardee (and a Community Partner, if appropriate) shall compile such data on the gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, or other information on individuals that utilize its products and services as the Fund shall prescribe in an Assistance Agreement. Such data will be used to determine whether residents of Investment Area(s) or members of Targeted Population(s) are adequately served and to evaluate the impact of the CDFI Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to records. An Awardee (and a Community Partner, if appropriate) must submit such financial and activity reports, records, statements, and documents at such times, in such forms, and accompanied by such reporting data, as required by the Fund or the U.S. Department of Treasury to ensure compliance with the requirements of this part and to evaluate the impact of the CDFI Program. The United States Government, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Comptroller General, and their duly authorized representatives, shall have full and free access to the Awardee's offices and facilities and all books, documents, records, and financial statements relating to use of Federal funds and may copy such documents as they deem appropriate. The Fund, if it deems appropriate, may prescribe access to record requirements for entities that are borrowers of, or that receive investments from, an Awardee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of records. An Awardee shall comply with all record retention requirements as set forth in OMB Circular A-110 (as applicable).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data collection and reporting.

and/or Community Partners, if appropriate) in implementing its Comprehensive Business Plan and satisfying the terms and conditions of its Assistance Agreement. The information and documentation shall include, but not be limited to, an Annual Report, which shall comprise the following components:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial Report:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All non-profit organizations (excluding Insured CDFIs and State-Insured Credit Unions) must submit to the CDFI Fund financial statements that have been audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, no later than 180 days after the end of the Awardee's fiscal year.

If the Fund requires the Awardee to submit the Transaction-Level Report on a semi-annual or quarterly basis, the Fund will notify the Awardee of the due date for the submission of said report at least 60 days prior to the due date. Only Awardees that receive financial assistance awards are required to submit Transaction-Level Reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Financial Status Report: The Financial Status Report is applicable only to Awardees that receive technical assistance awards and must be signed by the Awardee's authorized representative, and submitted to the Fund with the Annual Report.
