                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Capital Investment. The acquisition, installation,  transportation, and other costs needed to place equipment or facilities  in operation meeting DoD capitalization requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Economic Life. The time period over which the benefits to be  gained from a project may reasonably be expected to accrue to the  Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The discount rate that equates  the present value of the future cash inflows, e.g. savings and cost  avoidances, with the present value costs of an investment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Life-Cycle Savings. The estimated cumulative budgetary savings  expected over the life of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Net Present Value of Investment. The difference between the  present value benefit and the present value cost at a given discount  rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Off-the-Shelf. Equipment that is readily available through  Government or commercial sources or that can be fabricated through  combination or modification of existing equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Pay-Back Period. The number of years required for the cumulative  savings to have the same value as the investment cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> PECI Benefits. Benefits resulting from PECIs are classified as  savings or as cost avoidance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Savings. Benefits that can be precisely measured, quantified,  and placed   under management control at time of realization. Savings can be  reflected as specific reductions in the approved program or budget,  after they have been achieved. Examples include costs for manpower  authorizations and or funded work-year reductions, reduced or eliminated  operating costs (utilities, travel, and repair), and reduced or  eliminated parts and contracts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost-Avoidance. Benefits from actions that obviate the  requirements for an increase in future levels of manpower or costs that  would be necessary, if present management practices were continued. The  effect of cost-avoidance savings is the achievement of a higher level of  readiness or increased value (quantity, quality or timeliness) of output  at level staffing cost or the absorption of a growing work load at the  same level of staffing or cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Post-Investment Assessment (PIA). A PIA is conducted by DoD  Components to establish accountability and provide information to  improve future investment strategies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Productivity. The efficiency with which resources are used to  provide a government service or product at specified levels of quality  and timeliness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Productivity Enhancement (or Productivity Improvement). A  decrease in the unit cost of products and services delivered with equal  or better levels of quality and timeliness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI). Equipment or  facility funding that shall improve Government service, products,  quality, or timeliness. PECI projects are funded using PIF, PEIF, and  CSI programs. These programs are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Productivity Investment Fund (PIF). PIF projects cost over  $100,000 and must amortize within 4 years from the date they become  operational. In FY 1994 the threshold changes to $150,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Productivity Enhancing Incentive Fund (PEIF). PEIF projects cost  under $100,000 and are expected to amortize within 2 years of the date  they become operational. In FY 1994 the limit changes to $150,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Component-Sponsored Investment (CSI). CSI projects are fast pay- back or high interest investments that may have different DoD Component  selection criteria than those specified for PIF or PEIF projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Quality. The extent to which a product or service meets customer  requirements and customer expectations.</p>
