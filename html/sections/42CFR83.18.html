Such challenges must be submitted in  writing within 30 calendar days and must include evidence that the final  decision relies on a record of either substantial factual errors or  substantial errors in the implementation of the procedures of this part.  Challenges may not introduce new information or documentation concerning  the petition or the NIOSH or Board evaluation(s) that was not submitted  or presented by the petitioner(s) or others to NIOSH or to the Board  prior to the Board's issuing its recommendations under Sec.  83.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A panel of three HHS personnel, independent of NIOSH and  appointed by the Secretary, will conduct an administrative review based  on a challenge submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and provide  recommendations of the panel to the Secretary concerning the merits of  the challenge and the resolution of issues contested by the challenge.  Reviews by the panel will consider, in addition to the views and  information submitted by the petitioner(s) in the challenge, the NIOSH  evaluation report(s), the report containing the recommendations of the  Board issued under Sec.  83.15, and recommendations of the Director of  NIOSH to the Secretary. The reviews may also consider information  presented or submitted to the Board and the deliberations of the Board  prior to the issuance of the recommendations of the Board under Sec.   83.15. The panel shall consider whether HHS substantially complied with  the procedures of this part, the factual accuracy of the information  supporting the final decision, and the principal findings and  recommendations of NIOSH and those of the Board issued under Sec.   83.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary will decide whether or not to revise a final  decision contested by the petitioner(s) under this section after  considering information and recommendations provided to the Secretary by  the Director of NIOSH, the Board, and from the HHS administrative review  conducted under paragraph (b) of this section. HHS will transmit a  report of the decision to the petitioner(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Secretary decides under paragraph (c) of this section to  change a designation under Sec.  83.17(a) of this part or a  determination under Sec.  83.16(c) of this part, the Secretary will  transmit to Congress a report providing such change to the designation  or determination, including an iteration of the relevant criteria, as  specified under Sec.  83.13(c), and a summary of the information and  findings on which the decision is based. HHS will also publish a notice  summarizing the decision in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of Sec.  83.17.  [70 FR 75953, Dec. 22, 2005]</p>
