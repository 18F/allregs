In general, the United States  district court will have exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action  for a determination described in section 7429(b). However, if a petition  for a redetermination of a deficiency has been timely filed with the Tax  Court prior to the making of an assessment or levy that is subject to  the section 7429 review procedures, and one or more of the taxes and tax  periods before the Tax Court as a result of the petition is also  included in the written statement that was provided to the taxpayer,  then the Tax Court will have jurisdiction concurrent with the district  courts over any civil action for a judicial determination with respect  to all the taxes and tax periods included in the written statement. In  all other cases, the appropriate United States district court continues  to have exclusive jurisdiction over such an action.  [T.D. 8453, 57 FR 58985, Dec. 14, 1992]</p>
