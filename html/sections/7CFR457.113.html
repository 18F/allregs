Replanting Payments</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A replanting payment is allowed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these Crop Provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as specified in section 9(a)(1), you must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or the number of bushels (tons for corn insured as silage) for the applicable crop specified below, multiplied by your projected price, multiplied by your share:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 8 bushels for corn grain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 1 ton for corn silage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 7 bushels for grain sorghum; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 3 bushels for soybeans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the acreage is replanted to an insured crop type that is different than the insured crop type originally planted on the acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The production guarantee, premium, and projected price and harvest price, as applicable, will be adjusted based on the replanted type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replanting payments will be calculated using your projected price and production guarantee for the crop type that is replanted and insured; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For any corn unit that has separate dates for the end of the insurance period (grain and silage), in lieu of the requirement contained in section 14 of the Basic Provisions to provide notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period), you must provide notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days after the latest end of the insurance period applicable to the unit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If you will harvest any acreage in a manner other than as you reported it for coverage (e.g., you reported planting it to harvest as grain but will harvest the acreage for silage, or you reported planting it to harvest as silage but will harvest the acreage for grain), you must notify us before harvest begins. Failure to timely provide notice will result in production to count determined in accordance with section 11(c)(1)(i)(E).</p><p class="depth0">11. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide

records of production that are acceptable to us for any:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the number of insured acres of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Totaling the results of section 11(b)(1)(i) or 11(b)(1)(ii), whichever is applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Multiplying the production to count of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Projected price if you elected yield protection; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Totaling the results of section 11(b)(3)(i) or 11(b)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(4) from the result of section 11(b)(2); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(5) by your share.</p><p class="depth0">For example:</p><p class="depth0">You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of corn in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 115 bushels, your projected price is $2.25, your harvest price is $2.20, and your production to count is 5,000 bushels.</p><p class="depth0">If you elected yield protection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 50 acres x (115 bushel production guarantee x $2.25 projected price) = $12,937.50 value of the production guarantee</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 5,000 bushel production to count x $2.25 projected price = $11,250.00 value of the production to count</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> $12,937.50 - $11,250.00 = $1,687.50</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> $1,687.50 x 1.000 share = $1,688.00 indemnity; or</p><p class="depth0">If you elected revenue protection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 50 acres x (115 bushel production guarantee x $2.25 projected price) = $12,937.50 revenue protection guarantee</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 5,000 bushel production to count x $2.20 harvest price = $11,000.00 value of the production to count</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> $12,937.50 - $11,000.00 = $1,937.50</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> $1,937.50 x 1.000 share = $1,938.00 indemnity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The total production to count (in bushels for corn insured as grain or in tons for corn insured as silage) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All appraised production as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For yield protection, not less than the production guarantee, or for revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Put to another use without our consent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Damaged solely by uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For which you fail to give us notice before harvest begins if you report planting the corn to harvest as grain but harvest it as silage or you report planting the corn to harvest as silage but harvest it as grain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 11(d)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Potential production on insured acreage you will put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mature coarse grain production (excluding corn insured as silage) may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality. Corn insured as silage will be adjusted for excess moisture and quality only as specified in section 11(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fifteen percent (15%) for corn (If moisture exceeds 30 percent (30%), production will be reduced 0.2 percent for each 0.1 percentage point above 30 percent (30%));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fourteen percent (14%) for grain sorghum; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Thirteen percent (13%) for soybeans.</p><p class="depth0">We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain, result in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corn not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Grain sorghum not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor), or meets the special grade requirements for smutty grain sorghum; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Soybeans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except garlic odor), or which meet the special grade requirements for garlicky soybeans; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coarse grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 11(d) (2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For corn insured as silage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whenever our appraisal of grain content is less than 4.5 bushels of grain per ton of silage, the silage production will be reduced by 1 percentage point for each 0.1(1/10) of a bushel less than 4.5 bushels per ton (If we cannot make a grain appraisal before harvest and you do not leave a representative unharvested sample, in accordance with the policy no reduction for grain-deficient silage will be made.); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the normal silage harvesting period has ended, or for any acreage harvested as silage or appraised as silage after the calendar date for the end of the insurance period as specified in section 7(b), we may increase the silage production to count to a 65 percent moisture equivalent to reflect the normal moisture content of silage harvested during the normal silage harvesting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</p><p class="depth0">12.
