                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise approved by the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, transactions with affiliates involving asset transfers into or out of the regulated accounts shall be recorded by the carrier in its regulated accounts as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Non-tariffed assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be

recorded at the prevailing price. For all other assets sold by or transferred from a carrier to its affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at no less than the higher of fair market value and net book cost. For all other assets sold by or transferred to a carrier from its affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at no more than the lower of fair market value and net book cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Floor. When assets are sold by or transferred from a carrier to an affiliate, the higher of fair market value and net book cost establishes a floor, below which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or greater than the floor, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ceiling. When assets are purchased from or transferred from an affiliate to a carrier, the lower of fair market value and net book cost establishes a ceiling, above which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or less than the ceiling, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Threshold. For purposes of this section carriers are required to make a good faith determination of fair market value for an asset when the total aggregate annual value of the asset(s) reaches or exceeds $500,000, per affiliate. When a carrier reaches or exceeds the $500,000 threshold for a particular asset for the first time, the carrier must perform the market valuation and value the transaction on a going-forward basis in accordance with the affiliate transactions rules on a going-forward basis. When the total aggregate annual value of the asset(s) does not reach or exceed $500,000, the asset(s) shall be recorded at net book cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Non-tariffed services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant to publicly-filed agreements submitted to a state commission pursuant to section 252(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 or statements of generally available terms pursuant to section 252(f) shall be recorded using the charges appearing in such publicly-filed agreements or statements. Non-tariffed services provided between a carrier and its affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing price. For all other services sold by or transferred from a carrier to its affiliate, the services shall be recorded at no less than the higher of fair market value and fully distributed cost. For all other services sold by or transferred to a carrier from its affiliate, the services shall be recorded at no more than the lower of fair market value and fully distributed cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Floor. When services are sold by or transferred from a carrier to an affiliate, the higher of fair market value and fully distributed cost establishes a floor, below which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or greater than the floor, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ceiling. When services are purchased from or transferred from an affiliate to a carrier, the lower of fair market value and fully distributed cost establishes a ceiling, above which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or less than the ceiling, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Threshold. For purposes of this section, carriers are required to make a good faith determination of fair market value for a service when the total aggregate annual value of that service reaches or exceeds $500,000, per affiliate. When a carrier reaches or exceeds the $500,000 threshold for a particular service for the first time, the carrier must perform the market valuation

and value the transaction in accordance with the affiliate transactions rules on a going-forward basis. All services received by a carrier from its affiliate(s) that exist solely to provide services to members of the carrier's corporate family shall be recorded at fully distributed cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In order to qualify for prevailing price valuation in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, sales of a particular asset or service to third parties must encompass greater than 25 percent of the total quantity of such product or service sold by an entity. Carriers shall apply this 25 percent threshold on an asset-by-asset and service-by-service basis, rather than on a product-line or service-line basis. In the case of transactions for assets and services subject to section 272, a BOC may record such transactions at prevailing price regardless of whether the 25 percent threshold has been satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Income taxes shall be allocated among the regulated activities of the carrier, its nonregulated divisions, and members of an affiliated group. Under circumstances in which income taxes are determined on a consolidated basis by the carrier and other members of the affiliated group, the income tax expense to be recorded by the carrier shall be the same as would result if determined for the carrier separately for all time periods, except that the tax effect of carry-back and carry-forward operating losses, investment tax credits, or other tax credits generated by operations of the carrier shall be recorded by the carrier during the period in which applied in settlement of the taxes otherwise attributable to any member, or combination of members, of the affiliated group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Companies that employ average schedules in lieu of actual costs are exempt from the provisions of this section. For other organizations, the principles set forth in this section shall apply equally to corporations, proprietorships, partnerships and other forms of business organizations.
