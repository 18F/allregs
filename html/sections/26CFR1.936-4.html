                                Sec. 1.936-4  Intangible property income in the absence of an election
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The rules in this section apply for purposes of section 936(h) and also for purposes of section 934(e), where applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: If a possessions corporation and its affiliates do not make an election under either the cost sharing or 50/50 profit split option, what rules will govern the treatment of income attributable to intangible property owned or leased by the possessions corporation?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: Intangible property income will be allocated to the possessions corporation's U.S. shareholders with the proration of income based on shareholdings. If a shareholder of the possessions corporation is a foreign person or a tax-exempt person, the possessions corporation will be taxable on that shareholder's pro rata amount of the intangible property income. If any class of the stock of a possessions corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market, then the intangible property income will be taxable to the possessions corporation rather than the corporation's U.S. shareholders. For these purposes, a United States shareholder includes any shareholder who is a United States person as described under section 7701(a)(30). The term ``intangible property income'' means the gross income of a possessions corporation attributable to any intangible property other than intangible property which has been licensed to such corporation since prior to 1948 and which was in use by such corporation on September 3, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: What is the source of the intangible property income described in question 1?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: The intangible property income is U.S. source, whether taxed to U.S. shareholders or taxed to the possessions corporation. Such intangible property income, if treated as income of the possessions corporation, does not enter into the calculation of the 80-percent possessions source test or the 65-percent active trade or business test of section 936(a)(2)(A) and (B).</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: How will the amount of income attributable to intangible property be measured?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: Income attributable to intangible property includes the amount received by a possessions corporation from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of any product or from the rendering of a service which is in excess of the reasonable costs it incurs in manufacturing the product or rendering the service (other than costs incurred in connection with intangibles) plus a reasonable profit margin. A reasonable profit margin shall be computed with respect to direct and indirect costs other than (i) costs incurred in connection with intangibles, (ii) interest expense, and (iii) the cost of materials which are subject to processing or which are components in a product manufactured by the possessions corporation. Notwithstanding the above, certain taxpayers who have been permitted by the Internal Revenue Service in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983, to use the cost-plus method of pricing without reflecting a return from intangibles, but including the cost of materials in the cost base, will not be precluded from doing so. (Sec. 3.02(3), Rev. Proc. 63-10, 1963-1 C.B. 490.) Thus, the Internal Revenue Service may continue in appropriate cases to permit such taxpayers to continue to report their income as they have been under existing procedures described in the previous sentence if it is appropriate under all the facts and circumstances and does not distort the income of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: If there is no intangible property related to a product produced in whole or in part by a possessions corporation, what method may the possessions corporation use to compute its income?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: The taxpayer may compute its income using the appropriate method as provided under section 482 and the regulations thereunder. The taxpayer may also elect the cost sharing or profit split method.
