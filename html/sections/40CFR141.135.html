If the State approves the alternative minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, the State may make those requirements retroactive for the purposes of determining compliance.

systems for approval of alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements under paragraph (b)(3) of this section must include, at a minimum, results of bench- or pilot-scale testing conducted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.

The percent removal of TOC at this point on the ``TOC removal versus coagulant dose'' curve is then defined as the minimum TOC removal required for the system. Once approved by the State, this minimum requirement supersedes the minimum TOC removal required by the table in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This requirement will be effective until such time as the State approves a new value based on the results of a new bench- and pilot-scale test. Failure to achieve State-set alternative minimum TOC removal levels is a violation of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Bench- or pilot-scale testing of enhanced coagulation must be conducted by using representative water samples and adding 10 mg/L increments of alum (or equivalent amounts of ferric salt) until the pH is reduced to a level less than or equal to the enhanced coagulation Step 2 target pH shown in the following table:</p><p class="depth4">Enhanced Coagulation Step 2 target pH------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Alkalinity (mg/L as CaCO3)                   Target pH------------------------------------------------------------------------0-60.......................................................          5.560-120..........................................          6.3120-240.........................................          7.0240.............................................          7.5------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For waters with alkalinities of less than 60 mg/L for which addition of small amounts of alum or equivalent addition of iron coagulant drives the pH below 5.5 before significant TOC removal occurs, the system must add necessary chemicals to maintain the pH between 5.3 and 5.7 in samples until the TOC removal of 0.3 mg/L per 10 mg/L alum added (or equivalant addition of iron coagulant) is reached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The system may operate at any coagulant dose or pH necessary (consistent with other NPDWRs) to achieve the minimum TOC percent removal approved under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the TOC removal is consistently less than 0.3 mg/L of TOC per 10 mg/L of incremental alum dose at all dosages of alum (or equivalant addition of iron coagulant), the water is deemed to contain TOC not amenable to enhanced coagulation.
