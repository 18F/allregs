Any authorization for testimony by a present or former employee of OMB shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If response to a demand is required before instructions from the General Counsel are received, an attorney designated for that purpose by OMB shall appear, and shall furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this part and inform the court or other authority that the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for prompt consideration by the General Counsel. The court or other authority shall be requested respectfully to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions from the General Counsel.
