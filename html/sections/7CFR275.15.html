                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Analysis. Analysis is the process of classifying data, such as  by areas of program requirements or use of error-prone profiles, to  provide a basis for studying the data and determining trends including  significant characteristics and their relationships.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation. Evaluation is the process of determining the  cause(s) of each deficiency, magnitude of the deficiency, and geographic  extent of the deficiency, to provide the basis for planning and  developing effective corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each State agency must analyze and evaluate at the State and  project area levels all management information sources available to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify all deficiencies in program operations and systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify causal factors and their relationships;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify magnitude of each deficiency, where appropriate (This  is the frequency of each deficiency occurring based on the number of  program records reviewed and where applicable, the amount of loss either  to the program or participants or potential participants in terms of  dollars. The State agency shall include an estimate of the number of  participants or potential participants affected by the existence of the  deficiency, if applicable);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine the geographic extent of each deficiency (e.g.,  Statewide/individual project area or management unit); and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide a basis for management decisions on planning,  implementing, and evaluating corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the evaluation of data, situations may arise where the State  agency identifies the existence of a deficiency, but after reviewing all  available management information sources sufficient information is not  available to make a determination of the actual causal factor(s),  magnitude, or geographic extent necessary for the development of  appropriate corrective action. In these situations, the State agency  shall be responsible for gathering additional data necessary to make  these determinations. This action may include, but is not limited to,  conducting additional full or partial ME reviews in one or more project  areas/management units or discussions with appropriate officials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deficiencies identified from all management information sources  must be analyzed and evaluated together to determine their causes,  magnitude, and geographic extent. Causes indicated and deficiencies  identified must be examined to determine if they are attributable to a  single cause and can be effectively eliminated by a single action.  Deficiencies and causes identified must also be compared to the results  of past corrective action efforts to determine if the new problems arise  from the causal factors which contributed to the occurrence of  previously identified deficiencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data analysis and evaluation must be an ongoing process to  facilitate the development of effective and prompt corrective action.  The process shall also identify when deficiencies have been eliminated  through corrective action efforts, and shall provide for the  reevaluation of deficiencies and causes when it is determined that  corrective action has not been effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Identification of High Error Project Areas/Counties/Local  Offices. FNS may use quality control information to determine which  project areas/counties/local offices have reported payment error rates  that are either significantly greater than the State agency average or  greater than the national error standard of the Program. When FNS  notifies a State agency that a ``high error'' area exists, the State  agency shall ensure that corrective action is developed and reported in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 275.17. If FNS identifies a  ``high error'' locality which a State agency has previously identified  as error-prone and taken appropriate action, no further State agency  shall be required. If a State agency's corrective action plan fails to  address problems in FNS-identified ``high   error'' areas, FNS may require a State agency to implement new or  modified cost-effective procedures for the certification of households.
