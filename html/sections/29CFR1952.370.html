The  plan defines the covered occupational safety and health issues as  defined by the Secretary of Labor in 29 CFR 1902.2(c)(1) and all safety  and health standards adopted by the Secretary of Labor, except those  found in 29 CFR parts 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918 (ship repairing,  shipbuilding, shipbreaking and longshoring), will be enforced by the  State upon approval of the plan by the Assistant Secretary. The State  will retain its existing standard applicable to ionizing radiation. New  Federal standards will be adopted by the Safety and Health Codes  Commission within 6 months after Federal promulgation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of the  Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.
