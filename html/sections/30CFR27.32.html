Five hundred  successful consecutive tests \2\ for gas detection, alarm action, and  power shutoff in natural gas-air mixtures \3\ shall be conducted to  demonstrate acceptable performance as to reliability and durability of a  methane-monitoring system. The tests shall be conducted as follows: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Normal replacements and adjustments shall not constitute a  failure.</p><p class="depth2">\3\ Investigation has shown that, for practical purposes, natural  gas (containing a high percentage of methane) is a satisfactory  substitute for pure methane in these tests. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> The methane detector component shall be placed in a test gallery  into which natural gas shall be made to enter at various rates with  sufficient turbulence for proper mixing with the air in the gallery. To  comply with the requirements of this test, the detector shall provide an  impulse to actuate an alarm at a predetermined percentage of gas and  also provide an impulse to actuate a power shutoff at a second  predetermined percentage of gas. (See Sec. Sec. 27.21, 27.22, 27.23,  and 27.24.) \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\4\ At the option of MSHA, these tests will be conducted with dust  or moisture added to the atmosphere within the gallery. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Field tests. MSHA reserves the right to conduct tests, similar  to those stated in paragraph (a) of this section, in underground  workings to verify reliability and durability of a methane-monitoring  system installed in connection with a piece of mining equipment.</p>
