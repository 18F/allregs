Upon request from the Bureau, a state must provide evidence that it is  in compliance with the requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act and this part,  including citations to applicable state law and regulations;  descriptions of processes followed by the state's supervisory authority;  and data concerning examination, investigation, and enforcement actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination of noncompliance. If the Bureau makes an  initial determination that a state is not in compliance with the  S.A.F.E. Act, the Bureau will notify the state and will publish, in the  Federal Register, a notice providing the Bureau's initial determination  and presenting the opportunity for public comment for a period of no  less than 30 days. This public comment period will allow the residents  of the state and other interested members of the public to comment on  the Bureau's initial determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final determination of noncompliance. In making a final  determination of noncompliance, the Bureau will review additional  information that may be offered by a state and the comments submitted  during the public comment period described in paragraph (b) of this  section. If the Bureau makes a final determination that a state does not  have in place by law or regulation a system that complies with the  minimum requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act, as described in this part, the  Bureau will publish that final determination in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, then the Bureau will provide an  additional initial and final determination process before it determines  that the state is not in compliance and is subject to subparts C and E  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective date of subparts C and E. The provisions of subparts C  and E of this part will become effective with respect to a state for  which a final determination of noncompliance has been made upon:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The effective date of the Bureau's final determination with  respect to the state, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, unless  an extension had been granted to the state in accordance with paragraph  (d) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an extension had been granted to the state in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section, the effective date of the Bureau's  subsequent final determination with respect to the state following the  expiration of the period of time granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of  this section.</p>
