The notice of intent shall also request the tenants to notify the owner and the State agency of any individual or organization that has been designated or retained by the tenants to represent the tenants with respect to the actions to be taken under subpart B and subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing with HUD, mortgagee and tenants. The owner simultaneously shall file the notice of intent with the local HUD field office having jurisdiction over the area in which the project is located and with the mortgagee, if any. In addition, the owner shall deliver a copy of the notice of intent to each tenant in the project and to any tenant representative, if any, known to

the owner, and shall post a copy of the notice of intent in readily accessible locations within each affected building of the project. The copies of the notice of intent delivered to the tenants and the tenant representative shall include a summary of possible outcomes of the filing which shall be furnished by the State agency.
