L. 96-369 and Pub. L. 96-536) and the Supplemental Appropriations and Rescission Act, 1981 (Pub. L. 97-12) that make funds under those Acts available to pay for a State agency expenditure made before September 30, 1978, only if the State had filed a claim for that expenditure with us within one year of the expenditure.
