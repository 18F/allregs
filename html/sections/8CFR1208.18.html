                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The definitions in this subsection incorporate the  definition of torture contained in Article 1 of the Convention Against  Torture, subject to the reservations, understandings, declarations, and  provisos contained in the United States Senate resolution of  ratification of the Convention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering,  whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for  such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information  or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third  person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or  intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason  based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is  inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or  acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official  capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and  does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment  or punishment that do not amount to torture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,  inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. Lawful sanctions include  judicially imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by  law, including the death penalty, but do not include sanctions that  defeat the object and purpose of the Convention Against Torture to  prohibit torture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In order to constitute torture, mental pain or suffering must be  prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe  physical pain or suffering;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The administration or application, or threatened administration  or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures  calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The threat of imminent death; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The threat that another person will imminently be subjected to  death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or  application of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated  to disrupt profoundly the sense or personality.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically  intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. An act  that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and  suffering is not torture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In order to constitute torture an act must be directed against a  person in the offender's custody or physical control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Acquiescence of a public official requires that the public  official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of  such activity and   thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to  prevent such activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Noncompliance with applicable legal procedural standards does  not per se constitute torture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of Sec. Sec. 1208.16(c) and 1208.17(a)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Aliens in proceedings on or after March 22, 1999. An alien who is in  exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings on or after March 22,  1999 may apply for withholding of removal under Sec. 1208.16(c), and,  if applicable, may be considered for deferral of removal under Sec.  1208.17(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aliens who were ordered removed, or whose removal orders became  final, before March 22, 1999. An alien under a final order of  deportation, exclusion, or removal that became final prior to March 22,  1999 may move to reopen proceedings for the sole purpose of seeking  protection under Sec. 1208.16(c). Such motions shall be governed by  Sec. Sec. 1003.23 and 1003.2 of this chapter, except that the time and  numerical limitations on motions to reopen shall not apply and the alien  shall not be required to demonstrate that the evidence sought to be  offered was unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented  at the former hearing. The motion to reopen shall not be granted unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The motion is filed within June 21, 1999; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The evidence sought to be offered establishes a prima facie  case that the applicant's removal must be withheld or deferred under  Sec. Sec. 1208.16(c) or 1208.17(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aliens who, on March 22, 1999, have requests pending with the  Service for protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against  Torture. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as otherwise provided, after March 22, 1999, the  Service will not:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Consider, under its pre-regulatory administrative policy to  ensure compliance with the Convention Against Torture, whether Article 3  of that Convention prohibits the removal of an alien to a particular  country, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Stay the removal of an alien based on a request filed with the  Service for protection under Article 3 of that Convention.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each alien who, on or before March 22, 1999, filed a  request with the Service for protection under Article 3 of the  Convention Against Torture, and whose request has not been finally  decided by the Service, the Service shall provide written notice that,  after March 22, 1999, consideration for protection under Article 3 can  be obtained only through the provisions of this rule.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The notice shall inform an alien who is under an order of  removal issued by EOIR that, in order to seek consideration of a claim  under Sec. Sec. 1208.16(c) or 1208.17(a), such an alien must file a  motion to reopen with the immigration court or the Board of Immigration  Appeals. This notice shall be accompanied by a stay of removal,  effective until 30 days after service of the notice on the alien. A  motion to reopen filed under this paragraph for the limited purpose of  asserting a claim under Sec. Sec. 1208.16(c) or 1208.17(a) shall not be  subject to the requirements for reopening in Sec. Sec. 1003.2 and  1003.23 of this chapter. Such a motion shall be granted if it is  accompanied by a copy of the notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or  by other convincing evidence that the alien had a request pending with  the Service for protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against  Torture on March 22, 1999. The filing of such a motion shall extend the  stay of removal during the pendency of the adjudication of this motion.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The notice shall inform an alien who is under an administrative  order of removal issued by the Service under section 238(b) of the Act  or an exclusion, deportation, or removal order reinstated by the Service  under section 241(a)(5) of the Act that the alien's claim to withholding  of removal under Sec. 1208.16(c) or deferral of removal under Sec.  1208.17(a) will be considered under Sec. 1208.31.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The notice shall inform an alien who is under an administrative  order of removal issued by the Service under section 235(c) of the Act  that the alien's claim to protection under the Convention Against  Torture will be decided by the Service as provided in Sec. 1208.18(d)  and 1235.8(b)(4) and will not be considered under the provisions of this  part relating to consideration or review by an immigration judge, the  Board of Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Aliens whose claims to protection under the Convention Against  Torture were finally decided by the Service prior to March 22, 1999.  Sections 208.16(c) and 208.17 (a) and paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3)  of this section do not apply to cases in which, prior to March 22, 1999,  the Service has made a final administrative determination about the  applicability of Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture to the case  of an alien who filed a request with the Service for protection under  Article 3. If, prior to March 22, 1999, the Service determined that an  applicant cannot be removed consistent with the Convention Against  Torture, the alien shall be considered to have been granted withholding  of removal under Sec. 1208.16(c), unless the alien is subject to  mandatory denial of withholding of removal under Sec. 1208.16(d)(2) or  (d)(3), in which case the alien will be considered to have been granted  deferral of removal under 208.17(a). If, prior to March 22, 1999, the  Service determined that an alien can be removed consistent with the  Convention Against Torture, the alien will be considered to have been  finally denied withholding of removal under Sec. 1208.16(c) and  deferral of removal under Sec. 1208.17(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diplomatic assurances against torture obtained by the Secretary  of State. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary of State may forward to the Attorney General  assurances that the Secretary has obtained from the government of a  specific country that an alien would not be tortured there if the alien  were removed to that country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Secretary of State forwards assurances described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section to the Attorney General for  consideration by the Attorney General or her delegates under this  paragraph, the Attorney General shall determine, in consultation with  the Secretary of State, whether the assurances are sufficiently reliable  to allow the alien's removal to that country consistent with Article 3  of the Convention Against Torture. The Attorney General's authority  under this paragraph may be exercised by the Deputy Attorney General or  by the Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, but may not  be further delegated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once assurances are provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, the alien's claim for protection under the Convention Against  Torture shall not be considered further by an immigration judge, the  Board of Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cases involving aliens ordered removed under section 235(c) of  the Act. With respect to an alien terrorist or other alien subject to  administrative removal under section 235(c) of the Act who requests  protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, the  Service will assess the applicability of Article 3 through the removal  process to ensure that a removal order will not be executed under  circumstances that would violate the obligations of the United States  under Article 3. In such cases, the provisions of Part 208 relating to  consideration or review by an immigration judge, the Board of  Immigration Appeals, or an asylum officer shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Judicial review of claims for protection from removal under  Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to the  provisions of section 2242(d) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and  Restructuring Act of 1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review  of any action, decision, or claim raised under the Convention or that  section, except as part of the review of a final order of removal  pursuant to section 242 of the Act; provided however, that any appeal or  petition regarding an action, decision, or claim under the Convention or  under section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act  of 1998 shall not be deemed to include or authorize the consideration of  any administrative order or decision, or portion thereof, the appeal or  review of which is restricted or prohibited by the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this  paragraph shall be construed to create a private right of action or to  authorize the consideration or issuance of administrative or judicial  relief.
