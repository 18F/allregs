                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grants under Sec. 41.8 of this subpart may be made to a Community College only after a positive determination of feasibility as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within thirty (30) days of receiving a resolution or other duly authorized request from the governing body of one or more Indian Tribes, the Director of Education shall initiate a feasibility study to determine whether there is justification to encourage and maintain a Community College for such tribe or tribes. The feasibility study shall give consideration to the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial feasibility based upon potential enrollment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence of low tribal levels of tribal matriculation in and graduation from postsecondary educational institutions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tribal, linguistics, or cultural differences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Isolation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Presence of alternate education sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Proposed curriculum;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The benefits of continued and expanded educational opportunities for Indian students.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Director of Education will issue detailed guidelines for conducting and analyzing the feasibility studies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Feasibility studies under this section shall be conducted in consultation with the tribal governing body or bodies involved or their designated representatives. Each feasibility study shall be completed and filed by the Director of Education within sixty (60) days after the feasibility study has been initiated. The study shall be filed with (1) the Assistant Secretary, (2) the tribal governing body or bodies requesting the studies, and (3) with the board of directors, regents, or trustees of the Community College, if already established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the case of any feasibility study which results in a negative determination by the Director of Education, a Tribe requesting the study may within thirty (30) days of receipt of the study or of notice of such determination file a notice of appeal with the Assistant Secretary. Following the timely filing of a Tribe's notice of appeal, the Tribe and Community College shall have a right to a formal review of the feasibility study, including a hearing upon reasonable notice within sixty (60) days before the Assistant Secretary (or his/her designee, other than the Director of Education or any federal employee under the Director's supervision). At the hearing, the appealing Tribe or the Community College (or both) may present additional evidence or arguments to justify feasibility. Within thirty (30) days of the hearing, the Assistant Secretary shall issue a written ruling either confirming, modifying, or reversing the original determination. The ruling, which shall be final for the Department, shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the appealing Tribe and the Community College within one week of its issuance. In any case where the original negative determination is not reversed, the Assistant Secretary's ruling shall specify the grounds for the decision and state the manner in which the determination related to each of the factors specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A negative determination shall not prevent a Tribe from requesting another feasibility study, but no more than one feasibility study shall be requested for any given Community College per year.</p>
