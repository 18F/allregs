Therefore, applications for frequency assignments in this band shall include information concerning the transmitter output power, the type and directional characteristics of the antenna and the minimum hours of operation (GMT).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Frequencies in this band may only be assigned to radiolocation stations which are also assigned frequencies in the 1605-1800 kHz band, provided the use of frequencies in this band is necessary for the proper functioning of the particular radiolocation system. Operations in this band are on a secondary basis to stations operating in accordance with the Commission's table of frequency allocations contained in Sec. 2.106 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> This band is allocated to the Radiolocation Service on a secondary basis to other fixed or mobile services and must accept any harmful interference that may be experienced from such services or from the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment operating in accordance with part 18 of this chapter. In the 2483.5-2500 MHz band, no applications for new or modification to existing stations to increase the number of transmitters will be accepted. Existing licensees as of July 25, 1985, or on a subsequent date following as a result of submitting an application for license on or before July 25, 1985, are grandfathered and their operation is co-primary with the Radiodetermination Satellite Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Speed measuring devices will not be authorized in this band.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80) and to the Government Radiolocation Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> This frequency is shared with and is on a secondary basis to the Government Radiolocation Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Operations in this band are limited to survey operations using transmitters with a peak power not to exceed 5 watts into the antenna.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis to the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (part 87) and to the Government Radiolocation Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The non-Government Radiolocation Service in this band is secondary to the Maritime Radionavigation Stations (part 80), the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (part 87) and the Government Radiolocation Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis to the

Pulsed emissions are prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> This band is restricted to radiolocation systems using type N0N emission with a power not to exceed 40 watts into the antenna.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Non-Government radiolocation stations in the band are secondary to the Government Radiolocation Service, the Amateur Radio Service and the Amateur-Satellite Service. Pulse-ranging radiolocation stations in this band may be authorized along the shorelines of Alaska and the contiguous 48 states. Radiolocation stations using spread spectrum techniques may be authorized in the band 420-435 MHz for operation within the contiguous 48 states and Alaska. Also, stations using spread spectrum techniques shall be limited to a maximum output power of 50 watts, shall be subject to the applicable technical standards in Sec. 90.209 until such time as more definitive standards are adopted by the Commission and shall identify in accordance with Sec. 90.425(c)(2). Authorizations will be granted on a case-by-case basis; however, operations proposed to be located within the zones set forth in footnote US269, Sec. 2.106 of this chapter should not expect to be accommodated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> For frequencies 2455 MHz, 10,525 MHz, and 24,125 MHz, only unmodulated, continuous wave (NON) emission shall be employed. The frequency 24.10 GHz, and frequencies in the 24.20-24.25 GHz band may use NON emission along with an ancillary FM digital emission. The frequency 24.10 GHz will be used for the purpose of alerting motorists of hazardous driving conditions and the presence of emergency vehicles. Equipment operating on 24.10 GHz must keep the deviation of the FM digital signal within 5 MHz. Equipment operating on this frequency must have a frequency stability of at least 2000 ppm and is exempt from the requirements of Sec. Sec. 90.403(c), 90.403(f), and 90.429 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(23)</em> Devices designed to operate as field disturbance sensors on frequencies between 2450 and 2500 MHz with a field strength equal to or less than 50,000 microvolts per meter at 30 meters, on a fundamental frequency, will not be licensed or certificated for use under this part. Such equipment must comply with the requirements for field disturbance sensors as set forth in part 15 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(24)</em> Devices designed to operate as field disturbance sensors on frequencies between 10,500 and 10,550 MHz and between 24,050 and 24,250 MHz, with field strength equal to or less than 250,000 microvolts per meter at 30 meters, on the fundamental frequency, will not be licensed or certificated for use under this part.

After January 1, 2000, the Government's Space Research and Earth Exploration-Satellite Services shall operate on a co-equal secondary basis with the non-Government Radiolocation Service, except that grandfathered space stations in the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System shall continue to be protected from harmful interference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(30)</em> This frequency band is shared with and is on a secondary basis to the Government Radiolocation Service, the Fixed Satellite Service (part 25), and the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (part 96). No new licenses for Non-Federal Radiolocation Services in this band will be issued after July 23, 2015.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other additional frequencies available. Radiolocation stations in this service may be authorized, on request, to use frequencies allocated exclusively to Federal Government stations, in those instances where the Commission

finds, after consultation with the appropriate Government agency or agencies, that such assignment is necessary or required for coordination with Government activities.
