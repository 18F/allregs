                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(9)</em> of this section, and subpart G of  part 146. Permits for owners or operators of Class VI injection wells  shall include conditions meeting the requirements of subpart H of part  146. Permits for other wells shall contain the following requirements,  when applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Construction requirements as set forth in part 146. Existing  wells shall achieve compliance with such requirements according to a  compliance schedule established as a permit condition. The owner or  operator of a proposed new injection well shall submit plans for  testing, drilling, and construction as part of the permit application.  Except as authorized by an area permit, no constuction may commence  until a permit has been issued containing construction requirements (see  Sec.  144.11). New wells shall be in compliance with these requirements  prior to commencing injection operations. Changes in construction plans  during construction may be approved by the Administrator as minor  modifications (Sec.  144.41). No such changes may be physically  incorporated into construction of the well prior to approval of the  modification by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corrective action as set forth in Sec. Sec.  144.55, 146.7, and  146.84 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operation requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 146; the  permit shall establish any maximum injection volumes and/or pressures  necessary to assure that fractures are not initiated in the confining  zone, that injected fluids do not migrate into any underground source of  drinking water, that formation fluids are not displaced into any  underground source of drinking water, and to assure compliance with the  part 146 operating requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requirements for wells managing hazardous waste, as set forth in  Sec.  144.14.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitoring and reporting requirements as set forth in 40 CFR  part 146. The permittee shall be required to identify types of tests and  methods used to generate the monitoring data. For EPA administered  programs, monitoring of the nature of injected fluids shall comply with  applicable analytical methods cited and described in table I of 40 CFR  136.3 or in appendix III of 40 CFR part 261 or in certain circumstances  by other methods that have been approved by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After a cessation of operations of two years the owner or  operator shall plug and abandon the well in accordance with the plan  unless he:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provides notice to the Regional Administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describes actions or procedures, satisfactory to the Regional  Administrator, that the owner or operator will take to ensure that the  well will not endanger USDWs during the period of temporary abandonment.  These actions and procedures shall include compliance with the technical  requirements applicable to active injection wells unless waived by the  Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Financial responsibility. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The permittee, including the  transferor of a permit, is required to demonstrate and maintain  financial responsibility and resources to close, plug, and abandon the  underground injection operation in a manner prescribed by the Director  until:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The well has been plugged and abandoned in accordance with an  approved plugging and abandonment plan pursuant to Sec. Sec.  144.51(o),  146.10, and 146.92 of this chapter, and submitted a plugging and  abandonment report pursuant to Sec.  144.51(p); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The well has been converted in compliance with the requirements  of Sec.  144.51(n); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The transferor of a permit has received notice from the Director  that the owner or operator receiving transfer of the permit, the new  permittee, has demonstrated financial responsibility for the well.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The permittee shall show evidence of such financial  responsibility to the Director by the submission of a surety bond, or  other adequate assurance, such as a financial statement or other  materials acceptable to the Director. For EPA administered programs, the  Regional Administrator may on a periodic basis require the holder of a  lifetime permit to submit an estimate of the resources needed to plug  and abandon the well revised to reflect inflation of such costs, and a  revised demonstration of financial responsibility, if necessary. The  owner or operator of a well injecting hazardous waste must comply with  the financial responsibility requirements of subpart F of this part. For  Class VI wells, the permittee shall show evidence of such financial  responsibility to the Director by the submission of a qualifying  instrument (see Sec.  146.85(a) of this chapter), such as a financial  statement or other materials acceptable to the Director. The owner or  operator of a Class VI well must comply with the financial  responsibility requirements set forth in Sec.  146.85 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Mechanical integrity. A permit for any Class I, II, III or VI  well or injection project which lacks mechanical integrity shall  include, and for any Class V well may include, a condition prohibiting  injection operations until the permittee shows to the satisfaction of  the Director under Sec.  146.8, or Sec.  146.89 of this chapter for  Class VI, that the well has mechanical integrity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Additional conditions. The Director shall impose on a case-by- case basis such additional conditions as are necessary to prevent the  migration of fluids into underground sources of drinking water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to conditions required in all permits the  Director shall establish conditions in permits as required on a case-by- case basis, to provide for and assure compliance with all applicable  requirements of the SDWA and parts 144, 145, 146 and 124.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a State issued permit, an applicable requirement is a State  statutory or regulatory requirement which takes effect prior to final  administrative disposition of the permit. For a permit issued by EPA, an  applicable requirement is a statutory or regulatory requirement  (including any interim final regulation) which takes effect prior to the  issuance of the permit. Section 124.14 (reopening of comment period)  provides a means for reopening EPA permit proceedings at the discretion  of the Director where new requirements become effective during the  permitting process and are of sufficient magnitude to make additional  proceedings desirable. For State and EPA administered programs, an  applicable requirement is also any requirement which takes effect prior  to the modification or revocation and reissuance of a permit, to the  extent allowed in Sec.  144.39.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New or reissued permits, and to the extent allowed under Sec.   144.39 modified or revoked and reissued permits, shall incorporate each  of the applicable requirements referenced in Sec.  144.52.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Incorporation. All permit conditions shall be incorporated  either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, a  specific citation to the applicable regulations or requirements must be  given in the permit.
