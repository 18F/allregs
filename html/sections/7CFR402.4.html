                            <p class="depth0">Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement  (This is a continuous endorsement)</p><p class="depth0">If a conflict exists among the policy, the order of priority is: (1)  This Endorsement; (2) Special Provisions; (3) actuarial documents; (4)  the Commodity Exchange Price Provisions, if applicable; and (5) any of  the policies specified in section 2, with (1) controlling (2), etc.</p><p class="depth0">Terms and Conditions</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Insurance provider. A private insurance company that has been  approved by FCIC to provide insurance coverage to producers  participating in programs authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth0">Zero acreage report. An acreage report filed by you that certifies  you do not have a share in the crop for that crop year.</p><p class="depth0">2. Eligibility, Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must have one of the following policies in force to elect  this Endorsement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Common Crop Insurance Policy Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8)  and applicable   Crop Provisions (catastrophic risk protection coverage is not available  under individual revenue plans of insurance such as Revenue Protection  and Revenue Protection with Harvest Price Exclusion);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR  407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions (catastrophic risk protection  coverage is not available under area revenue plans of insurance such as  Area Revenue Protection or Area Revenue Protection with the Harvest  Price Exclusion); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other crop policies only if catastrophic risk protection  coverage is provided in the applicable crop policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must have made application for catastrophic risk protection  on or before the sales closing date for the crop in the county.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must be a ``person'' as defined in the crop policy to be  eligible for catastrophic risk protection coverage.</p><p class="depth0">3. Unit Division</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section is not applicable if you are insured under the Area  Risk Protection Insurance Basic Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable  Crop Provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section is in lieu of the unit provisions specified in the  applicable crop policy. For catastrophic risk protection coverage, a  unit will be all insurable acreage of the insured crop in the county on  the date coverage begins for the crop year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In which you have one hundred percent (100%) crop share; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Which is owned by one person and operated by another person on a  share basis.</p><p class="depth3">(Example: If, in addition to the land you own, you rent land from  five landlords, three on a crop share basis and two on a cash basis, you  would be entitled to four units; one for each crop share lease and one  that combines the two cash leases and the land you own.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Further division of the units described in paragraph (b) above  is not allowed under this Endorsement.</p><p class="depth0">4. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining</p><p class="depth0">Indemnities</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions,  catastrophic risk protection coverage will offer protection equal to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fifty percent (50%) of your approved yield indemnified at fifty- five percent (55%) of the price election or projected price, as  applicable, if you are insured under the Common Crop Insurance Policy  Basic Provisions (7 CFR 457.8) and applicable Crop Provisions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sixty-five percent (65%) of the expected county yield  indemnified at forty-five percent (45%) of the maximum protection per  acre if you are insured under the Area Risk Protection Insurance Basic  Provisions (7 CFR 407.9) and applicable Crop Provisions; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A comparable coverage as established by FCIC for other crop  policies only if catastrophic risk protection coverage is provided in  the applicable crop policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the crop policy denominates coverage in dollars per acre or  other measure, or any other alternative method of coverage, such  coverage will be converted to the amount of coverage that would be  payable at fifty percent (50%) of your approved yield indemnified at  fifty-five percent (55%) of the price election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may elect catastrophic coverage for any crop insured or  reinsured by FCIC on either an individual yield and loss basis or an  area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered as set out in the  Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">5. Report of Acreage</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The report of crop acreage that you file in accordance with the  crop policy must be signed on or before the acreage reporting date. For  catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable  interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting  date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf, the  operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an  insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons  with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the operator  purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained  in that acreage report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity only,  your share will not exceed your insurable interest at the earlier of the  time of loss or the beginning of harvest. Unless the accepted  application clearly indicates that insurance is requested for a  partnership or joint venture, insurance will only cover the crop share  of the person completing the application. The share will not extend to  any other person having an interest in the crop except as may otherwise  be specifically allowed in this endorsement. Any acreage or interest  reported by or for your spouse, child or any member of your household  may be considered your share. A lease containing provisions for both a  minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds,  etc.) and a crop share will be considered a crop share lease. A lease  containing provisions for either a minimum payment (such as a specified  amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,) or a crop share will be  considered a cash lease. Land rented for cash, a fixed commodity  payment, or any consideration other than a share in the insured crop on  such land will be considered as owned by the lessee.</p><p class="depth0">6. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section and  notwithstanding any provision contained in any other policy document,  you will not be responsible to pay a   premium, nor will the policy be terminated because the premium has not  been paid. FCIC will pay a premium subsidy equal to the premium  established for the coverage provided under this endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In return for catastrophic risk protection coverage, you must  pay an administrative fee and premium as specified in paragraph (f) of  this section to us within 30 days after you have been billed, unless  otherwise authorized in the Federal Crop Insurance Act (You will be  billed by the date stated in the actuarial documents);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The administrative fee owed is $300 for each crop in the county  unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you  file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting  date for the crop (if you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be  subject to criminal and administrative sanctions).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The administrative fee provisions of paragraph (b) of this  section do not apply if you are a ``beginning farmer or rancher'' or a  ``limited resource farmer'' as defined in the applicable crop policy.  The administrative fee will be waived if you request it and you meet the  requirements contained in the annual premium provisions of the  applicable crop policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a crop policy has provisions to allow you the option to  separately insure individual crop types or varieties, you must pay a  separate administrative fee in accordance with paragraph (b) of this  section for each type or variety you elect to separately insure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the administrative fee and premium as specified in paragraph  (f) of this section is not paid when due, you, and all persons with an  insurable interest in the crop under the same contract, may be  ineligible for certain other USDA program benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective for any policies with a sales closing date on or after  July 1, 2015, you will be responsible for payment of the premium  established for the coverage provided under this endorsement if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> USDA determines you have committed a violation of the highly  erodible land conservation or wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR  part 12 as amended by the Agricultural Act of 2014; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You have not filed form AD-1026 or successor form with FSA by  June 1 prior to the sales closing date to be properly identified as in  compliance with the conservation provisions specified in paragraph  (f)(1) of this section (For example, to be eligible for a premium  subsidy for a crop with a sales closing date of March 15, 2016, you must  have filed your form AD-1026 by June 1, 2015).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if you  demonstrate you are a beginning farmer or rancher who has not previously  had an insurable interest in a crop or livestock and began farming for  the first time after June 30 prior to the sales closing date, you fail  to file form AD-1026 or successor form with the FSA, by June 1 after you  make application for insurance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To be eligible for premium subsidy paid on your behalf by FCIC,  it is your responsibility to assure you meet all the requirements for:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Compliance with the conservation provisions specified in  paragraph (f)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Filing form AD-1026, or successor form, to be properly  identified as in compliance with the conservation provisions specified  in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the Act expressly authorizes an option or endorsement to be  available in addition to the coverage available under this Endorsement  (for example, the Supplemental Coverage Option) or any other additional  coverage offered under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (for example, the  Stacked Income Protection Plan), you will owe a separate annual premium  and administrative fee for such option or endorsement if the option or  endorsement has been made available in the actuarial documents and you  elect to purchase such coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Failure to pay the premium specified in paragraph (f) of this  section will result in the termination of the policy and all other  policies in accordance with the termination provisions specified in the  applicable Basic Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">7. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">The crop insured is specified in the applicable crop policy;  however, for policies other than those insured under the Area Risk  Protection Insurance Basic Provisions, notwithstanding any other policy  provision requiring the same insurance coverage on all insurable acreage  of the crop in the county, if you purchase additional coverage for a  crop, you may separately insure acreage designated as ``high-risk'' land  by FCIC under catastrophic risk protection coverage, provided that you  execute a High-Risk Land Exclusion Option and obtain a catastrophic risk  protection coverage policy with the same insurance provider on or before  the applicable sales closing date. You will be required to pay a  separate administrative fee for both the additional coverage policy and  the catastrophic risk protection coverage policy.</p><p class="depth0">8. Replanting Payment</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance  document, no replant payment will be paid whether or not replanting of  the crop is required under the policy.</p><p class="depth0">9. Claim for Indemnity</p><p class="depth0">If two or more insured crop types, varieties, or classes are insured  within the same unit, and multiple price elections, projected prices, or  amounts of insurance are applicable, the dollar amount of insurance and  the dollar amount of production to be counted will be determined  separately for each type, variety, class, etc., that have separate price  elections, projected prices, or amounts of insurance and then totaled to  determine the total liability or dollar amount of production to be  counted for the unit.</p><p class="depth0">10. Concealment or Fraud</p><p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance  document, your CAT policy may be voided by us on all crops without  waiving any of our rights, including the right to collect any amounts  due:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If at any time you conceal or misrepresent any material fact or  commit fraud relating to this or any other contract issued under the  authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Act with any insurance provider;  and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The voidance will be effective for the crop year during which  any such act or omission occurred.</p><p class="depth0">11. Exclusion of Coverage</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Options or endorsements that extend the coverage available under  any crop policy offered by FCIC will not be available under this  endorsement, except for the Supplemental Coverage Option and any other  option or endorsement or other additional coverage expressly authorized  in the Federal Crop Insurance Act and allowed in the actuarial documents  (for example, the Stacked Income Protection Plan). Written agreements  are not available for any crop insured under this endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop  policy, hail and fire coverage and high-risk land may not be excluded  under catastrophic risk protection.
