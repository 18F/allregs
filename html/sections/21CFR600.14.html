(1) You, the manufacturer who holds the biological product license and who had control over the product when the deviation occurred, must report under this section. If you arrange for another person to perform a manufacturing, holding, or distribution step, while the product is in your control, that step is performed under your control. You must establish, maintain, and follow a procedure for receiving information from that person on all deviations, complaints, and adverse events concerning the affected product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Persons who manufacture only in vitro diagnostic products that are not subject to licensing under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act do not report biological product deviations for those products under this section but must report in accordance with part 803 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Persons who manufacture blood and blood components, including licensed manufacturers, unlicensed registered blood establishments, and transfusion services, do not report biological product deviations for those products under this section but must report under Sec. 606.171 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Persons who manufacture Source Plasma or any other blood component and use that Source Plasma or any other blood component in the further manufacture of another licensed biological product must report:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Under Sec. 606.171 of this chapter, if a biological product deviation occurs during the manufacture of that Source Plasma or any other blood component; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under this section, if a biological product deviation occurs after the manufacture of that Source Plasma or any other blood component, and during manufacture of the licensed biological product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What do I report under this section? You must report any event, and information relevant to the event, associated with the manufacturing, to include testing, processing, packing, labeling, or storage, or with the holding or distribution, of a licensed biological

product, if that event meets all the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Represents a deviation from current good manufacturing practice, applicable regulations, applicable standards, or established specifications that may affect the safety, purity, or potency of that product; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Represents an unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity, or potency of that product; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Occurs in your facility or another facility under contract with you; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Involves a distributed biological product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When do I report under this section? You should report a biological product deviation as soon as possible but you must report at a date not to exceed 45-calendar days from the date you, your agent, or another person who performs a manufacturing, holding, or distribution step under your control, acquire information reasonably suggesting that a reportable event has occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How do I report under this section You must report on Form FDA-3486.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Where do I report under this section? (1) For biological products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), send the completed Form FDA-3486 to the Director, Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality (HFM-600) (see mailing addresses in Sec. 600.2), or an electronic filing through CBER's Web site at http://www.fda.gov/cber/biodev/biodev.htm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For biological products regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), send the completed Form FDA-3486 to the Division of Compliance Risk Management and Surveillance (HFD-330) (see mailing addresses in Sec. 600.2). CDER does not currently accept electronic filings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you make a paper filing, you should identify on the envelope that a biological product deviation report (BPDR) is enclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> How does this regulation affect other FDA regulations? This part supplements and does not supersede other provisions of the regulations in this chapter. All biological product deviations, whether or not they are required to be reported under this section, should be investigated in accordance with the applicable provisions of parts 211 and 820 of this chapter.
