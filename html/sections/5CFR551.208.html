                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To qualify for the learned professional exemption, an employee's  primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced  knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a  prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. The work must  include the following three elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge.  Work requiring advanced knowledge is predominantly intellectual in  character and includes work requiring the consistent exercise of  discretion and judgment, as distinguished from performance of routine  mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. An employee who performs  work requiring advanced knowledge generally uses the advanced knowledge  to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or  circumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school  level;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning  which includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology,  accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, teaching,  various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy,  and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status  as distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where in  some instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in  a field of science or learning; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a  prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction which restricts  the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a  standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession. The best prima  facie evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of  the appropriate academic degree. However, the word ``customarily'' means  that the exemption is appropriate for employees in such professions who  have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially  the same work as the degreed employees, but who attained the advanced  knowledge through a combination of work experience and intellectual  instruction. For example, the learned professional exemption is  appropriate in unusual cases where a lawyer has not gone to law school,  or a chemist does not possess a degree in chemistry. However, the  learned professional exemption is not applicable to occupations that  customarily may be performed with only the general knowledge acquired by  an academic degree in any field, with knowledge acquired through an  apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine mental,  manual, mechanical, or physical processes. The learned professional  exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees  have acquired their skill by experience rather than by advanced  specialized intellectual instruction. The position of Engineering  Technician is an example of such an occupation where the employee  collects, observes, tests and records factual scientific data within the  oversight of professional engineers, and performs work using knowledge  acquired through on-the-job and classroom training rather than by  acquiring the knowledge through prolonged academic study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expansion of professional exemption. The areas in which the  professional exemption may be applicable are expanding. As knowledge is  developed, academic training is broadened and specialized degrees are  offered in new and diverse fields, thus creating new specialists in  particular fields of science or learning. When an advanced   specialized degree has become a standard requirement for a particular  occupation, that occupation may have acquired the characteristics of a  learned profession. Accrediting and certifying organizations similar to  those listed in this section also may be created in the future. Such  organizations may develop similar, specialized curriculums and  certification programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular  occupation, may indicate that the occupation has acquired the  characteristics of a learned profession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Practice of law. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This exemption applies to an employee in a  professional legal position requiring admission to the bar and involved  in preparing cases for trial and/or the trial of cases before a court or  an administrative body or persons having quasi-judicial power; rendering  legal advice and services; preparing interpretive and administrative  orders, rules, or regulations; drafting, negotiating, or examining  contracts or other legal documents; drafting, preparing formal comments,  or otherwise making substantive recommendations with respect to proposed  legislation; editing and preparing for publication statutes enacted by  Congress and opinions or decisions of a court, commission, or board; and  drafting and reviewing decisions for consideration and adoption by  agency officials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 551.203 (Salary-based nonexemption) does not apply to  the employees described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Practice of medicine. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee who holds a valid license  or certificate permitting the practice of medicine or any of its  branches and is actually engaged in the practice of the profession is  exempt. The exemption applies to physicians and other practitioners  licensed and practicing in the field of medical science and healing or  any of the medical specialties practiced by physicians or practitioners.  The term ``physicians'' includes medical doctors, including general  practitioners and specialists, osteopathic physicians (doctors of  osteopathy), podiatrists, dentists (doctors of dental medicine), and  optometrists (doctors of optometry or bachelors of science in  optometry).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee who holds the required academic degree for the  general practice of medicine and is engaged in an internship or resident  program pursuant to the practice of the profession is exempt. Employees  engaged in internship or resident programs, whether or not licensed to  practice prior to commencement of the program, qualify as exempt  professionals if they enter such internship or resident programs after  the earning of the appropriate degree required for the general practice  of their profession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 551.203 (Salary-based nonexemption) does not apply to  the employees described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Accounting. Certified public accountants generally meet the  duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. An employee  performing similar professional work in a position with a positive  educational requirement and requiring the application of accounting  theories, concepts, principles, and standards may qualify as an exempt  learned professional. However, accounting clerks and technicians and  other employees who normally perform a great deal of routine work  generally will not qualify as exempt professionals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Engineering. Engineers generally meet the duties requirements  for the learned professional exemption. Professional engineering work  typically involves the application of a knowledge of such engineering  fundamentals as the strength and strain analysis of engineering  materials and structures, the physical and chemical characteristics of  engineering materials such as elastic limits, maximum unit stresses,  coefficients of expansion, workability, hardness, tendency to fatigue,  resistance to corrosion, engineering adaptability, and engineering  methods of construction and processing. Exempt professional engineering  work includes equivalent work performed in any of the specialized  branches of engineering (e.g., electrical, mechanical, or materials  engineering). On unusual occasions, engineering technicians performing  work comparable to that performed by professional engineers on the basis  of advanced knowledge may also be exempt. In such instances, the  employee actually is performing the   work of an occupation that generally requires a specialized academic  degree and is performing substantially the same work as the degreed  employee, but has gained the same advanced knowledge through a  combination of work experience and intellectual instruction which has  provided both theoretical and practical knowledge of the specialty,  including knowledge of related disciplines and of new developments in  the field.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Architecture. Architects generally meet the duties requirements  for the learned professional exemption. Professional architectural work  typically requires knowledge of architectural principles, theories,  concepts, methods, and techniques; a creative and artistic sense; and an  understanding and skill to use pertinent aspects of the construction  industry, as well as engineering and the physical sciences related to  the design and construction of new, or the improvement of existing,  buildings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Teachers. A teacher is any employee with a primary duty of  teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of  imparting knowledge and who is employed and engaged in this activity as  a teacher in an educational establishment by which the employee is  employed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A teacher performs exempt work when serving, for example, as a  regular academic teacher; teacher of kindergarten or nursery school  pupils; teacher of gifted or disabled children; teacher of skilled and  semi-skilled trades and occupations; teacher engaged in automobile  driving instruction; aircraft flight instructor; home economics teacher;  or vocal or instrumental music instructor. A faculty member who is  engaged as a teacher but also spends a considerable amount of time in  extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic teams or acting as  a moderator or advisor in such areas as drama, speech, debate, or  journalism is engaged in teaching. Such activities are a recognized part  of an educational establishment's responsibility in contributing to the  educational development of the student. An instructor in an institution  of higher education or another educational establishment whose primary  duty is teaching, tutoring, instructing, or lecturing in the activity of  imparting knowledge is also an exempt teacher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The possession of an elementary or secondary teacher's  certificate provides a clear means of identifying the individuals  contemplated as being within the scope of the exemption for teaching  professionals. Teachers who possess a teaching certificate qualify for  the exemption regardless of the terminology (e.g., permanent,  conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or unlimited)  used by appropriate certifying entities. However, a teacher's  certificate is not generally necessary for post-secondary educational  establishments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exempt teachers do not include teachers of skilled and semi- skilled trade, craft, and laboring occupations when the paramount  knowledge is the knowledge of and the ability to perform the trade,  craft, or laboring occupation. Conversely, if the primary requirement of  the post-secondary education instructor is the ability to instruct, as  opposed to knowledge of and ability to perform a trade, craft, or  laboring occupation, then the position may be exempt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 551.203 (Salary-based nonexemption) does not apply to  the employees described in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medical technologists. Registered or certified medical  technologists who have successfully completed 3 academic years of pre- professional study in an accredited college or university, plus a 4th  year of professional course work in a school of medical technology  approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical  Association, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned  professional exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Nurses. Registered nurses who are registered by the appropriate  State examining board generally meet the duties requirements for the  learned professional exemption. Licensed practical nurses and other  similar health care employees, however, generally do not qualify as  exempt learned professionals because possession of a specialized  advanced academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into  such occupations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Dental hygienists. Dental hygienists who have successfully  completed 4   academic years of pre-professional and professional study in an  accredited college or university approved by the Commission on  Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Educational Programs of the  American Dental Association generally meet the duties requirements for  the learned professional exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Physician assistants. Physician assistants who have successfully  completed 4 academic years of pre-professional and professional study,  including graduation from a physician assistant program accredited by  the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician  Assistant, and who are certified by the National Commission on  Certification of Physician Assistants, generally meet the duties  requirements for the learned professional exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not  qualify as exempt learned professionals because an advanced, specialized  academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field.  Although many paralegals possess general 4-year advanced degrees, most  specialized paralegal programs are 2-year associate degree programs from  a community college or equivalent institution. However, the learned  professional exemption is applicable to paralegals who possess advanced,  specialized degrees in other professional fields and apply advanced  knowledge in that field in the performance of their duties. In addition,  a paralegal who fails to meet the professional exemption criteria may be  performing exempt administrative work, e.g., overseeing a full range of  support services for a large legal office.</p>
