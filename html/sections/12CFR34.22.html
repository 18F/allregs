                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If a national bank makes an ARM loan to which 12 CFR  226.19(b) applies (i.e., the annual percentage rate of a loan may  increase after consummation, the term exceeds one year, and the  consumer's principal dwelling secures the indebtedness), the loan  documents must specify an index or combination of indices to which  changes in the interest rate will be linked. This index must be readily  available to, and verifiable by, the borrower and beyond the control of  the bank. A national bank may use as an index any measure of rates of  interest that meets these requirements. The index may be either single  values of the chosen measure or a moving average of the chosen measure  calculated over a specified period. A national bank also may increase  the interest rate in accordance with applicable loan documents  specifying the amount of the increase and the times at which, or  circumstances under which, it may be made. A national bank may decrease  the interest rate at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. Thirty days after filing a notice with the OCC, a  national bank may use an index other than one described in paragraph (a)  of this section unless, within that 30-day period, the OCC has notified  the bank that the notice presents supervisory concerns or raises  significant issues of law or policy. If the OCC provides such notice to  the bank, the bank may not use that   index unless it applies for and receives the OCC's prior written  approval.
