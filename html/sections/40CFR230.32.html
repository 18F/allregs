These adverse impacts upon wildlife habitat may result from changes in  water levels, water flow and circulation, salinity, chemical content,  and substrate characteristics and elevation. Increased water turbidity  can adversely affect wildlife species which rely upon sight to feed, and  disrupt the respiration and feeding of certain aquatic wildlife and food  chain organisms. The availability of contaminants from the discharge of  dredged or fill material may lead to the bioaccumulation of such  contaminants in wildlife. Changes in such physical and chemical factors  of the environment may favor the introduction of undesirable plant and  animal species at the expense of resident species and communities. In  some aquatic environments lowering plant and animal species diversity  may disrupt the normal functions of the ecosystem and lead to reductions  in overall biological productivity.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Possible actions to minimize adverse impacts regarding  characteristics of biological components of the aquatic ecosystem can be  found in subpart H.</p>
