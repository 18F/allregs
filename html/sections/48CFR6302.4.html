                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duties of contracting officer. Within 30 days after receipt of  notice that an appeal has been docketed, the contracting officer shall  assemble and transmit to the Board, with a copy to the appellant and the  Government attorney, an appeal file consisting of all documents  pertinent of the appeal, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer's decision and finding of fact from  which the appeal is taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contract, including pertinent specifications, modifications,  plans, and drawings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All correspondence between the parties pertinent to the appeal,  including the letters of claim in response to which the decision was  issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of  proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter  in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the  Board; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any additional information considered pertinent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duties of the appellant. Within 30 days after receipt of a copy  of the appeal file assembled by the contracting officer, the appellant  may supplement the file by transmitting to the Board any additional  documents which it considers pertinent to the appeal and shall furnish  two copies of such documents to the Government attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Organization of appeal file. Documents in the appeal file may be  originals or legible facsimiles or authenticated copies, and shall be  arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered  sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents of the file.  The contracting officer's final decision and the contract shall be  conveniently placed in the file for ready reference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lengthy documents. The Board may waive the requirement of  furnishing to the other party copies of bulky, lengthy, or out-of-size  documents in the appeal file when a party has shown that doing so would  impose an undue burden. At the time a party files with the Board a  document as to which such a waiver has been granted, the other party  shall be notified that the document or a copy is available for  inspection at the offices of the Board or of the party filing the  document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Status documents in appeal file. Documents contained in the  appeal file are, without further action by the parties, a part of the  record upon which the Board renders its decision, unless a party objects  to the consideration of a particular document at or before the hearing  or, if there is no hearing on the appeal, before closing the record. If  objection to a document is made, the Board rules upon its admissibility  into the record as evidence in accordance with Rules 17 and 23.</p>
