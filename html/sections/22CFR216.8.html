                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In most instances AID will be able to gain the benefit of public  participation in the impact statement process through circulation of  draft statements and notice of public availability in CEQ publications.  However, in some cases the Administrator may wish to hold public  hearings on draft Environmental Impact Statements. In deciding whether  or not a public hearing is appropriate, Bureaus in conjunction with the  Environmental Coordinator should consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The magnitude of the proposal in terms of economic costs, the  geographic area involved, and the uniqueness or size of commitment of  the resources involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The degree of interest in the proposal as evidenced by requests  from the public and from Federal, state and local authorities, and  private organizations and individuals, that a hearing be held;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The complexity of the issue and likelihood that information will  be presented at the hearing which will be of assistance to the Agency;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which public involvement already has been achieved  through other means, such as earlier public hearings, meetings with  citizen representatives, and/or written comments on the proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If public hearings are held, draft Environmental Impact  Statements to be discussed should be made available to the public at  least fifteen (15) days prior to the time of the public hearings, and a  notice will be placed in the Federal Register giving the subject, time  and place of the proposed hearings.
