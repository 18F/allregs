                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Responsibility to maintain a file. The following shall maintain  for public inspection a file containing the material set forth in this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants for a construction permit for a new station in the  noncommercial educational broadcast services shall maintain a public  inspection file containing the material, relating to that station,  described in paragraph (e)(2) and (e)(11) of this section. A separate  file shall be maintained for each station for which an application is  pending. If the application is granted, paragraph (a)(2) of this section  shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Every permittee or licensee of an AM, FM, or TV station in the  noncommercial educational broadcast services shall maintain a public  inspection file containing the material, relating to that station,  described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this section. In  addition, every permittee or licensee of a noncommercial educational TV  station shall maintain for public inspection a file containing material,  relating to that station, described in paragraphs (e)(12) of this  section. A separate file shall be maintained for each station for which  an authorization is outstanding, and the file shall be maintained so  long as an authorization to operate the station is outstanding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Location of the file. The public inspection file shall be  located as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For radio licensees, a hard copy of the public inspection file  shall be maintained at the main studio of the station.

Effective July 1, 2014, any new political file material shall be placed  on the Commission's Web site, while the material in the political file  as of July 1, 2014, if not placed on the Commission's Web site, shall  continue to be retained at the station in the manner discussed in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section until the end of its retention period.  However, any noncommercial educational station that is not required to  place its political file on the Commission's Web site before July 1,  2014 may choose to do so instead of retaining the political file at the  station in the manner discussed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A  station must provide a link to the public inspection file hosted on the  Commission's Web site from the home page of its own Web site, if the  station has a Web site, and provide contact information for a station  representative on its Web site that can assist any person with  disabilities with issues related to the content of the public files. A  station also is required to include in the online public file the  station's main studio address and telephone number, and the email  address of the station's designated contact for questions about the  public file. To the extent this section refers to the local public  inspection file, it refers to the public file of an individual station,  which is either maintained at the station or on the Commission's Web  site, depending upon where the documents are required to be maintained  under the Commission's rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission will automatically link the following items to  the electronic version of all licensee and applicant public inspection  files, to the extent that the Commission has these items electronically:  Authorizations; applications; contour maps; ownership reports and  related materials; portions of the Equal Employment Opportunity file  held by the Commission; and ``The Public and Broadcasting''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to material in the file. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The file shall be available  for public inspection at any time during regular business hours.

Material in the  public inspection file shall be made available for printing or machine  reproduction upon request made in person. The applicant, permittee, or  licensee may specify the location for printing or reproduction, require  the requesting party to pay the reasonable cost thereof, and may require  guarantee of payment in advance (e.g., by requiring a deposit, obtaining  credit card information, or any other reasonable method). Requests for  copies shall be fulfilled within a reasonable period of time, which  generally should not exceed 7 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant, permittee, or licensee who maintains its main  studio and public file outside its community of license shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Make available to persons within its geographic service area, by  mail upon telephone request, photocopies of documents in the file (see  Sec.  73.3527(c)(1)), excluding the political file (see Sec.   73.3527(e)(5)), and the station shall pay postage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mail the most recent version of ``The Public and Broadcasting''  to any member of the public that requests a copy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be prepared to assist members of the public in identifying the  documents they may ask to be sent to them by mail, for example, by  describing to the caller, if asked, the period covered by a particular  report and the number of pages included in the report.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (c)(2): For purposes of this section, geographic  service area includes the area within the protected service contour in a  particular service: Grade B contour for TV, 1 mVm contour for all FM  station classes except .7 mV/m for Class B1 stations and .5 mV/m for  Class B stations, and .5 mV/m contour for AM stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Responsibility in case of assignment or transfer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases  involving applications for consent to assignment of broadcast station  construction permits or licenses, with respect to which public notice is  required to be given under the provisions of Sec.  73.3580 or Sec.   73.3594, the file mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section shall be  maintained by the assignor.
