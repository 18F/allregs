SNFs are grouped by urban or rural location by census region. Separate means of adjusted labor-related and nonlabor routine operating costs for each SNF group are established in accordance with the SNF's region and urban or rural location. For each group, the mean labor-related and mean nonlabor-related per diem routine operating costs are multiplied by 105 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Computation of routine capital-related cost.
