                            <p class="depth0">The owners and operators, and to the extent applicable, the CAIR designated representative, of a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit, shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as provided in this subpart and in subpart H of part 75 of this chapter. For purposes of complying with such requirements, the definitions in Sec. 96.302 and in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter shall apply, and the terms ``affected unit,'' ``designated representative,'' and ``continuous emission monitoring system'' (or ``CEMS'') in part 75 of this chapter shall be deemed to refer to the terms ``CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit,'' ``CAIR designated representative,'' and ``continuous emission monitoring system'' (or ``CEMS'') respectively, as defined in Sec. 96.302. The owner or operator of a unit that is not a CAIR

NOX Ozone Season unit but that is monitored under Sec. 75.72(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter shall comply with the same monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting. The owner or operator of each CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Install all monitoring systems required under this subpart for monitoring NOX mass emissions and individual unit heat input (including all systems required to monitor NOX emission rate, NOX concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack gas flow rate, CO2 or O2 concentration, and fuel flow rate, as applicable, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 75.71 and 75.72 of this chapter);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Successfully complete all certification tests required under Sec. 96.371 and meet all other requirements of this subpart and part 75 of this chapter applicable to the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Compliance deadlines. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall meet the monitoring system certification and other requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section on or before the following dates. The owner or operator shall record, report, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on and after the following dates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the owner or operator of a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation before July 1, 2007, by May 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the owner or operator of a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation on or after July 1, 2007 and that reports on an annual basis under Sec. 96.374(d), by the later of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> May 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the owner or operator of a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit that commences commercial operation on or after July 1, 2007 and that reports on a control period basis under Sec. 96.374(d)(2)(ii), by the later of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which the unit commences commercial operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is not during a control period, May 1 immediately following the compliance date under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the owner or operator of a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit for which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on NOX emission controls is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (2), (6), or (7) of this section and that reports on an annual basis under Sec. 96.374(d), by 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue or add-on NOX emissions controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For the owner or operator of a CAIR NOX Ozone Season unit for which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on NOX emission controls is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph (b)(1), (3), (6), or (7) of this section and that reports on a control period basis under Sec. 96.374(d)(2)(ii), by the later of the following dates:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after the date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue or add-on NOX emissions controls; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the compliance date under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section is not during a control period, May 1 immediately following the compliance date under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notwithstanding the dates in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, for the owner or operator of a unit for which a CAIR NOX Ozone Season opt-in permit application is submitted and not withdrawn and a CAIR
