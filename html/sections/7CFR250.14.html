                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standards for Warehousing and Distribution Systems--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of  cost efficient and effective facilities. Distributing agencies shall use  the most cost effective and efficient system for providing warehousing  and distribution services to recipient agencies. For the purpose of this  part, commercial facilities are defined as enterprises that provide  commercial warehousing services or commercial delivery services, or  those commercial enterprises that provide both warehousing and delivery  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timeframes for evaluation. All distributing agencies shall  evaluate their current warehousing and distribution systems. Initial  evaluations shall be submitted to the FNSRO by June 30, 1990. Subsequent  evaluations of noncommercial systems shall, at a minimum, be submitted  to FNS every three years by March 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evaluation of current systems. The evaluation of the system in  place shall, at a minimum, include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the principal warehousing/delivery techniques  used by the distributing agency. The description should include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The frequency of delivery available;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The timeframes for making deliveries;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The type of delivery service offered (to the loading dock or  placement in the storeroom); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The system for recipient agencies to order specific amounts of  food from available inventory; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An estimate of all costs that will be incurred in administering  the Food Distribution Program for the upcoming school year. These costs  include transportation, storage and handling of donated foods (if the  current distributing agency system does not include delivery to  recipient agencies, identification of costs incurred by recipient  agencies to pick up commodities at a warehouse and to deliver the food  to a centralized storage facility or the individual preparation sites),  salaries of persons directly connected with the administration of the  program and other program related expenses. These expenses shall include  fringe benefits, travel expenses, rent, utilities, accounting/auditing  services to recipient agencies such as the costs for administering and  monitoring the State's processing program, and technical assistance  workshops.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Comparison of existing system with commercial systems. All  distributing agencies which do not use commercial facilities for a basic  level of warehousing and distribution services shall compare the cost of  warehousing and distributing commodities under their current system with  the cost of comparable services under a commercial system for the  upcoming school year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost comparison shall be made between the cost of providing  a basic level of service under its current system and the cost of  obtaining an equivalent level of service from commercial facilities.  This basic level of service shall consist of the transportation, storage  and handling of donated food from the time of delivery by the Department  to a distributing agency until delivery to a recipient agency's  centralized storage facility or individual preparation sites and shall  include monthly deliveries of donated food to all recipient agencies  except those that have agreed to less frequent deliveries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A distributing agency may base its cost comparison on a level  of service in excess of the basic level and/or on services not currently  provided. In all cases, the comparison must be made on the costs of  providing a comparable level of service under the existing system (as  identified in Sec. 250.14(a)(2)) versus a commercial system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a distributing agency is unable to locate any commercial  facilities expressing interest in providing the basic level of  warehousing and distribution services, the distributing agency shall  indicate this in its cost comparison submission, together with  documentation of its efforts to obtain cost estimates from commercial  facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All initial data regarding the cost of the current warehousing  and distribution system and the cost for comparable commercial  facilities shall be submitted to the FNSRO by June 30, 1990. Subsequent  cost comparisons shall, at a minimum, be submitted to FNS once every  three years by March 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Approval to use other systems. Distributing agencies that do not  implement a commercial warehousing and distribution system shall apply  to the FNSRO for approval to use other facilities and must demonstrate  that other facilities are more cost effective and efficient. All  requests for a waiver shall be accompanied with a full evaluation of the  existing system complete with cost comparison data. Each request will be  considered on a case by case basis. Initial requests for approval of  alternative systems shall be submitted to the FNSRO by June 30, 1990.  Subsequent requests shall, at a minimum, be submitted to the FNSRO once  every three years by March 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> System implementation. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Distributing agencies shall implement  the most cost effective and efficient system for warehousing and  distribution services to recipient agencies by July 1, 1991. Unless  otherwise approved by the FNSRO, subsequent to July 1, 1991, a  distributing agency shall convert to a commercial system within six  months of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date of submission of evaluation and cost comparison data  indicating that a commercial system is more cost effective and efficient  (if no request for approval of an alternate system is made); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date of the denial of a request to use an alternative  system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If at any time FNS determines that the warehousing and  distribution system in place is not cost effective or efficient, the  distributing agency will be required to reevaluate its system (including  a cost comparison and request for continued approval to use an  alternative system) in accordance with this subsection within 90 days of  notification by the FNSRO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Revisions in system. All distributing agencies (using either  commercial or noncommercial systems) shall request approval from the  FNSRO at least 90 days in advance of any planned reduction in the level  of service provided or any increase in distribution charges beyond  normal inflation. If FNS determines the proposed changes are  inappropriate, FNS may require the distributing agency to submit  additional justification, deny the request, or request a reevaluation of  the system in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for storage facilities. Distributing agencies,  subdistributing agencies and recipient agencies shall provide facilities  for the handling, storage and distribution of donated foods which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are sanitary and free from rodent, bird, insect and other animal  infestation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safeguard against theft, spoilage and other loss;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain foods at proper storage temperatures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Excepting recipient agencies, stock and space foods in a manner  so that USDA-donated foods are readily identified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Store donated food off the floor in a manner to allow for  adequate ventilation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Take other protective measures as may be necessary.  Distributing agencies, subdistributing agencies and recipient agencies  shall ensure that storage facilities have obtained all required Federal,  State and/or local health inspections and/or approvals and that such  inspection/approvals are current.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contracts. When contracting for storage facilities, distributing  agencies and subdistributing agencies shall enter into written contracts  to be effective for no longer than five years, including option years  extending a contract. Before the exercise of option years, the storage  facility shall update all pertinent information and demonstrate that all  donated foods received during the previous contract period have been  accounted for. The contract shall, at a minimum, contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assurance that the storage facilities will be maintained in  accordance with the standards specified in paragraph (b) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence that donated food shall be clearly identified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assurance that an inventory system shall be maintained and an  annual physical inventory will be conducted; and reconciled with the  inventory records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Beginning and ending dates of the contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A provision for immediate termination of the contract due to  noncompliance on the part of the warehouse management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A provision allowing for termination of the contract for cause  by either party upon 30 days written notification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The amount of any insurance coverage, which has been purchased  to protect the value of food items which are being stored; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Express written consent for inspection and inventory by the  distributing agency, subdistributing agency,   recipient agency, the Comptroller General, the Department or any of  their duly authorized representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Physical inventory. During the annual review required by  paragraph (c) of this section, distributing agencies and subdistributing  agencies shall take a physical inventory of their storage facilities.  The physical inventory shall be reconciled with each storage facility's  book inventory. The reconciliation records shall be maintained by the  agency that contracted for or maintained the storage facility. Food  items that have been lost, stolen, or found to be out of condition,  shall be identified and recorded. Potential excessive inventory, as  described in paragraph (f) of this section, shall be reported by the  subdistributing agency to the distributing agency. Corrective action on  each deficiency noted during these inventories shall be initiated  immediately, and a written report of those corrective actions shall be  forwarded to the distributing agency. Where applicable, the distributing  agency shall pursue claims in accordance with Sec. 250.15(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Excessive inventories. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The distributing agency shall  determine if a subdistributing agency's inventories are excessive based  on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rate of distribution;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Anticipated distribution; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other concerns such as logistical and economic considerations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In no case may the inventory level of each donated food in  storage exceed a six-month supply unless sufficient justification for  additional inventory has been submitted and approved. Subdistributing  agencies shall submit justification to the distributing agency in  instances where more than a six-month inventory is needed. Justification  shall be submitted by the distributing agency to the FNSRO for approval  in instances where more than a six-month inventory is needed at the  distributing agency level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The distributing agency shall take corrective action to ensure  that excess inventories at all levels are eliminated and shall document  actions taken to reduce excessive inventories.
