The term ``construction'' does not include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Changes for temporary use of the land for public recreational purposes;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Site exploration, including necessary borings to determine foundation conditions or other preconstruction monitoring to establish background information related to the suitability of the site, the environmental impacts of construction or operation, or the protection of environmental values;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Preparation of the site for construction of the facility, including clearing of the site, grading, installation of drainage, erosion and other environmental mitigation measures, and construction of temporary roads and borrow areas;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Erection of fences and other access control measures that are not related to the safe use of, or security of, radiological materials subject to this part;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Excavation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Erection of support buildings (e.g., construction equipment storage sheds, warehouse and shop facilities, utilities, concrete mixing plants, docking and unloading facilities, and office buildings) for use in connection with the construction of the facility;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> Building of service facilities (e.g., paved roads, parking lots, railroad spurs, exterior utility and lighting systems, potable water systems, sanitary sewerage treatment facilities, and transmission lines);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(8)</em> Procurement or fabrication of components or portions of the proposed facility occurring at other than the final, in-place location at the facility; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(9)</em> Taking any other action that has no reasonable nexus to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Radiological health and safety, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Common defense and security.</p><p class="depth3">Doubly encapsulated sealed source means a sealed source in which the radioactive material is sealed within a capsule and that capsule is sealed within another capsule.</p><p class="depth3">Irradiator means a facility that uses radioactive sealed sources for the irradiation of objects or materials and in which radiation dose rates exceeding 5 grays (500 rads) per hour exist at 1 meter from the sealed radioactive sources in air or water, as applicable for the irradiator type, but does not include irradiators in which both the

sealed source and the area subject to irradiation are contained within a device and are not accessible to personnel.</p><p class="depth3">Irradiator operator means an individual who has successfully completed the training and testing described in Sec. 36.51 and is authorized by the terms of the license to operate the irradiator without a supervisor present.</p><p class="depth3">Panoramic dry-source-storage irradiator means an irradiator in which the irradiations occur in air in areas potentially accessible to personnel and in which the sources are stored in shields made of solid materials. The term includes beam-type dry-source-storage irradiators in which only a narrow beam of radiation is produced for performing irradiations.</p><p class="depth3">Panoramic irradiator means an irradiator in which the irradiations are done in air in areas potentially accessible to personnel.
