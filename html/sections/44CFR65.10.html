                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For purposes of the NFIP, FEMA will only recognize in  its flood hazard and risk mapping effort those levee systems that meet,  and continue to meet, minimum design, operation, and maintenance  standards that are consistent with the level of protection sought  through the comprehensive flood plain management criteria established by  Sec. 60.3 of this subchapter. Accordingly, this section describes the  types of information FEMA needs to recognize, on NFIP maps, that a levee  system provides protection from the base flood. This information must be  supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of  such a levee system at the time a flood risk study or restudy is  conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this  subchapter is sought based on a levee system, and upon request by the  Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously  recognized structures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of  establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and  shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how a structure or  system will perform in a flood event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Design criteria. For levees to be recognized by FEMA, evidence  that adequate design and operation and maintenance systems are in place  to provide reasonable assurance that protection from the base flood  exists must be provided. The following requirements must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Freeboard. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Riverine levees must provide a minimum freeboard  of three feet above the water-surface level of the base flood. An  additional one foot above the minimum is required within 100 feet in  either side of structures (such as bridges) riverward of the levee or  wherever the flow is constricted. An additional one-half foot above the  minimum at the upstream end of the levee, tapering to not less than the  minimum   at the downstream end of the levee, is also required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum riverine freeboard  requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may be  approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate  protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a  request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the  uncertainty in the estimated base flood elevation profile and include,  but not necessarily be limited to an assessment of statistical  confidence limits of the 100-year discharge; changes in stage-discharge  relationships; and the sources, potential, and magnitude of debris,  sediment, and ice accumulation. It must be also shown that the levee  will remain structurally stable during the base flood when such  additional loading considerations are imposed. Under no circumstances  will freeboard of less than two feet be accepted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For coastal levees, the freeboard must be established at one  foot above the height of the one percent wave or the maximum wave runup  (whichever is greater) associated with the 100-year stillwater surge  elevation at the site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum coastal levee freeboard  requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, may be  approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate  protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a  request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the  uncertainty in the estimated base flood loading conditions. Particular  emphasis must be placed on the effects of wave attack and overtopping on  the stability of the levee. Under no circumstances, however, will a  freeboard of less than two feet above the 100-year stillwater surge  elevation be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Closures. All openings must be provided with closure devices  that are structural parts of the system during operation and design  according to sound engineering practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Embankment protection. Engineering analyses must be submitted  that demonstrate that no appreciable erosion of the levee embankment can  be expected during the base flood, as a result of either currents or  waves, and that anticipated erosion will not result in failure of the  levee embankment or foundation directly or indirectly through reduction  of the seepage path and subsequent instability. The factors to be  addressed in such analyses include, but are not limited to: Expected  flow velocities (especially in constricted areas); expected wind and  wave action; ice loading; impact of debris; slope protection techniques;  duration of flooding at various stages and velocities; embankment and  foundation materials; levee alignment, bends, and transitions; and levee  side slopes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Embankment and foundation stability. Engineering analyses that  evaluate levee embankment stability must be submitted. The analyses  provided shall evaluate expected seepage during loading conditions  associated with the base flood and shall demonstrate that seepage into  or through the levee foundation and embankment will not jeopardize  embankment or foundation stability. An alternative analysis  demonstrating that the levee is designed and constructed for stability  against loading conditions for Case IV as defined in the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers (COE) manual, ``Design and Construction of Levees'' (EM  1110-2-1913, Chapter 6, Section II), may be used. The factors that shall  be addressed in the analyses include: Depth of flooding, duration of  flooding, embankment geometry and length of seepage path at critical  locations, embankment and foundation materials, embankment compaction,  penetrations, other design factors affecting seepage (such as drainage  layers), and other design factors affecting embankment and foundation  stability (such as berms).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Settlement. Engineering analyses must be submitted that assess  the potential and magnitude of future losses of freeboard as a result of  levee settlement and demonstrate that freeboard will be maintained  within the minimum standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section. This analysis must address embankment loads, compressibility of  embankment soils, compressibility of foundation soils, age of the levee  system, and construction   compaction methods. In addition, detailed settlement analysis using  procedures such as those described in the COE manual, ``Soil Mechanics  Design--Settlement Analysis'' (EM 1100-2-1904) must be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Interior drainage. An analysis must be submitted that identifies  the source(s) of such flooding, the extent of the flooded area, and, if  the average depth is greater than one foot, the water-surface  elevation(s) of the base flood. This analysis must be based on the joint  probability of interior and exterior flooding and the capacity of  facilities (such as drainage lines and pumps) for evacuating interior  floodwaters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other design criteria. In unique situations, such as those where  the levee system has relatively high vulnerability, FEMA may require  that other design criteria and analyses be submitted to show that the  levees provide adequate protection. In such situations, sound  engineering practice will be the standard on which FEMA will base its  determinations. FEMA will also provide the rationale for requiring this  additional information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operation plans and criteria. For a levee system to be  recognized, the operational criteria must be as described below. All  closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether  manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially  adopted operation manual, a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by  the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought  or when the manual for a previously recognized system is revised in any  manner. All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or  State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of  a community participating in the NFIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Closures. Operation plans for closures must include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation of the flood warning system, under the  jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be  used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that  sufficient flood warning time exists for the completed operation of all  closure structures, including necessary sealing, before floodwaters  reach the base of the closure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A formal plan of operation including specific actions and  assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provisions for periodic operation, at not less than one-year  intervals, of the closure structure for testing and training purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interior drainage systems. Interior drainage systems associated  with levee systems usually include storage areas, gravity outlets,  pumping stations, or a combination thereof. These drainage systems will  be recognized by FEMA on NFIP maps for flood protection purposes only if  the following minimum criteria are included in the operation plan:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation of the flood warning system, under the  jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be  used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that  sufficient flood warning time exists to permit activation of mechanized  portions of the drainage system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A formal plan of operation including specific actions and  assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provision for manual backup for the activation of automatic  systems.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Provisions for periodic inspection of interior drainage systems  and periodic operation of any mechanized portions for testing and  training purposes. No more than one year shall elapse between either the  inspections or the operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other operation plans and criteria. Other operating plans and  criteria may be required by FEMA to ensure that adequate protection is  provided in specific situations. In such cases, sound emergency  management practice will be the standard upon which FEMA determinations  will be based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance plans and criteria. For levee systems to be  recognized as providing protection from the base flood, the maintenance  criteria must be as described herein. Levee systems must be maintained  in accordance with an officially adopted maintenance plan, and a copy of  this plan must be provided to FEMA by the owner of the levee system when  recognition is being   sought or when the plan for a previously recognized system is revised in  any manner. All maintenance activities must be under the jurisdiction of  a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or  an agency of a community participating in the NFIP that must assume  ultimate responsibility for maintenance. This plan must document the  formal procedure that ensures that the stability, height, and overall  integrity of the levee and its associated structures and systems are  maintained. At a minimum, maintenance plans shall specify the  maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency of their  performance, and the person by name or title responsible for their  performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification requirements. Data submitted to support that a  given levee system complies with the structural requirements set forth  in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section must be certified by a  registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the  levee must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition  given at Sec. 65.2 of this subchapter. In lieu of these structural  requirements, a Federal agency with responsibility for levee design may  certify that the levee has been adequately designed and constructed to  provide protection against the base flood.
