                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--(1) Allowance of deduction. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section, any loss arising from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty is allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) for the taxable year in which the loss is sustained. However, see Sec. 1.165-6, relating to farming losses, and Sec. 1.165-11, relating to an election by a taxpayer to deduct disaster losses in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster occurred. The manner of determining the amount of a casualty loss allowable as a deduction in computing taxable income under section 63 is the same whether the loss has been incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit, or whether it has been a loss of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit. The amount of a casualty loss shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. For other rules relating to the treatment of deductible casualty losses, see Sec. 1.1231-1, relating to the involuntary conversion of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allowance of deduction.

For other rules relating to the treatment of deductible casualty losses, see Sec. 1.1231-1, relating to the involuntary conversion of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Method of valuation. (i) In determining the amount of loss deductible under this section, the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the casualty shall generally be ascertained by competent appraisal. This appraisal must recognize the effects of any general market decline affecting undamaged as well as damaged property which may occur simultaneously with the casualty, in order that any deduction under this section shall be limited to the actual loss resulting from damage to the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In determining the amount of loss deductible under this section, the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the casualty shall generally be ascertained by competent appraisal. This appraisal must recognize the effects of any general market decline affecting undamaged as well as damaged property which may occur simultaneously with the casualty, in order that any deduction under this section shall be limited to the actual loss resulting from damage to the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of repairs to the property damaged is acceptable as evidence of the loss of value if the taxpayer shows that (a) the repairs are necessary to restore the property to its condition immediately before the casualty, (b) the amount spent for such repairs is not excessive, (c) the repairs do not care for more than the damage suffered, and (d) the value of the property after the repairs does not as a result of the repairs exceed the value of the property immediately before the casualty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Damage to automobiles. An automobile owned by the taxpayer, whether used for business purposes or maintained for recreation or pleasure, may be the subject of a casualty loss, including those losses specifically referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. In addition, a casualty loss occurs when an automobile owned by the taxpayer is damaged and when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The damage results from the faulty driving of the taxpayer or other person operating the automobile but is not due to the willful act or willful negligence of the taxpayer or of one acting in his behalf or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The damage results from the faulty driving of the operator of the vehicle with which the automobile of the taxpayer collides.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application to inventories. This section does not apply to a casualty loss

reflected in the inventories of the taxpayer. For provisions relating to inventories, see section 471 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Property converted from personal use. In the case of property which originally was not used in the trade or business or for income-producing purposes and which is thereafter converted to either of such uses, the fair market value of the property on the date of conversion, if less than the adjusted basis of the property at such time, shall be used, after making proper adjustments in respect of basis, as the basis for determining the amount of loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.165-9, and Sec. 1.167(g)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Theft losses. A loss which arises from theft is not considered a casualty loss for purposes of this section. See Sec. 1.165-8, relating to theft losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amount deductible--(1) General rule. In the case of any casualty loss whether or not incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit, the amount of loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) shall be the lesser of either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. In the case of any casualty loss whether or not incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit, the amount of loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a) shall be the lesser of either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount which is equal to the fair market value of the property immediately before the casualty reduced by the fair market value of the property immediately after the casualty; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the adjusted basis prescribed in Sec. 1.1011-1 for determining the loss from the sale or other disposition of the property involved.
However, if property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income is totally destroyed by casualty, and if the fair market value of such property immediately before the casualty is less than the adjusted basis of such property, the amount of the adjusted basis of such property shall be treated as the amount of the loss for purposes of section 165(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aggregation of property for computing loss. (i) A loss incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit shall be determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph by reference to the single, identifiable property damaged or destroyed. Thus, for example, in determining the fair market value of the property before and after the casualty in a case where damage by casualty has occurred to a building and ornamental or fruit trees used in a trade or business, the decrease in value shall be measured by taking the building and trees into account separately, and not together as an integral part of the realty, and separate losses shall be determined for such building and trees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A loss incurred in a trade or business or in any transaction entered into for profit shall be determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph by reference to the single, identifiable property damaged or destroyed.

The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1956 B purchases for $3,600 an automobile which he uses for nonbusiness purposes. In 1959 the automobile is damaged in an accidental collision with another automobile. The fair market value of B's automobile is $2,000 immediately before the collision and $1,500 immediately after the collision. B receives insurance proceeds of $300 to cover the loss. The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) for the taxable year 1959 is $200, computed as follows:
Value of automobile immediately before casualty...............    $2,000Less: Value of automobile immediately after casualty..........     1,500</p><p class="depth0">---------Value of property actually destroyed..........................       500</p><p class="depth0">=========Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a):        500</p><p class="depth0">Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($500) or</p><p class="depth0">adjusted basis of property ($3,600)..........................Less: Insurance received......................................       300</p><p class="depth0">---------Deduction allowable...........................................       200</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1958 A purchases land containing an office building for the lump sum of $90,000. The purchase price is allocated between the land ($18,000) and the building ($72,000) for purposes of determining basis. After the purchase A planted trees and ornamental shrubs on the grounds surrounding the building. In 1961 the land, building, trees, and shrubs are damaged by hurricane. At the time of the casualty the adjusted basis of the land is $18,000 and the adjusted basis of the building is $66,000. At that time the trees and shrubs have an adjusted basis of $1,200. The fair market value of the land and building immediately before the casualty is $18,000

and $70,000, respectively, and immediately after the casualty is $18,000 and $52,000, respectively. The fair market value of the trees and shrubs immediately before the casualty is $2,000 and immediately after the casualty is $400. In 1961 insurance of $5,000 is received to cover the loss to the building. A has no other gains or losses in 1961 subject to section 1231 and Sec. 1.1231-1. The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) with respect to the building for the taxable year 1961 is $13,000, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before casualty.................   $70,000Less: Value of property immediately after casualty............    52,000</p><p class="depth0">---------Value of property actually destroyed..........................    18,000</p><p class="depth0">=========Less: Insurance received......................................     5,000Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a):     18,000</p><p class="depth0">Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($18,000) or</p><p class="depth0">adjusted basis of property ($66,000).........................Less: Insurance received......................................     5,000</p><p class="depth0">---------Deduction allowable...........................................    13,000</p><p class="depth0">The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) with respect to the trees and shrubs for the taxable year 1961 is $1,200, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before casualty.................    $2,000Less: Value of property immediately after casualty............      $400</p><p class="depth0">---------Value of property actually destroyed..........................     1,600</p><p class="depth0">=========Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a):      1,200</p><p class="depth0">Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($1,600) or</p><p class="depth0">adjusted basis of property ($1,200)..........................</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that A purchases land containing a house instead of an office building. The house is used as his private residence. Since the property is used for personal purposes, no allocation of the purchase price is necessary for the land and house. Likewise, no individual determination of the fair market values of the land, house, trees, and shrubs is necessary. The amount of the deduction allowable under section 165(a) with respect to the land, house, trees, and shrubs for the taxable year 1961 is $14,600, computed as follows:
Value of property immediately before casualty.................   $90,000Less: Value of property immediately after casualty............    70,400</p><p class="depth0">---------Value of property actually destroyed..........................    19,600</p><p class="depth0">=========Loss to be taken into account for purposes of section 165(a):     19,600</p><p class="depth0">Lesser amount of property actually destroyed ($19,600) or</p><p class="depth0">adjusted basis of property ($91,200).........................Less: Insurance received......................................     5,000</p><p class="depth0">---------Deduction allowable...........................................    14,600</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation on certain losses sustained by individuals after December 31, 1963. (i) Pursuant to section 165(c)(3), the deduction allowable under section 165(a) in respect of a loss sustained--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> After December 31, 1963, in a taxable year ending after such date,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In respect of property not used in a trade or business or for income producing purposes, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> From a single casualty
shall be limited to that portion of the loss which is in excess of $100. The nondeductibility of the first $100 of loss applies to a loss sustained after December 31, 1963, without regard to when the casualty occurred. Thus, if property not used in a trade or business or for income producing purposes is damaged or destroyed by a casualty which occurred prior to January 1, 1964, and loss resulting therefrom is sustained after December 31, 1963, the $100 limitation applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $100 limitation applies separately in respect of each casualty and applies to the entire loss sustained from each casualty. Thus, if as a result of a particular casualty occurring in 1964, a taxpayer sustains in 1964 a loss of $40 and in 1965 a loss of $250, no deduction is allowable for the loss sustained in 1964 and the loss sustained in 1965 must be reduced by $60 ($100-$40). The determination of whether damage to, or destruction of, property resulted from a single casualty or from two or more separate casualties will be made upon the basis of the particular facts of each case. However, events which are closely related in origin generally give rise to a single casualty. For example, if a storm damages a taxpayer's residence and his automobile parked in his driveway, any loss sustained results from a single casualty. Similarly, if a hurricane causes high waves, all wind and flood damage to a taxpayer's property caused by the hurricane and the waves results from a single casualty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the $100 limitation applies separately to each individual taxpayer who sustains a loss even though the property damaged or destroyed is owned by two or more individuals. Thus, if a house occupied by two sisters and jointly owned by them is damaged or destroyed, the $100 limitation applies separately to each sister in respect of any loss sustained by her. However, for purposes of applying the

$100 limitation, a husband and wife who file a joint return for the first taxable year in which the loss is allowable as a deduction are treated as one individual taxpayer. Accordingly, if property jointly owned by a husband and wife, or property separately owned by the husband or by the wife, is damaged or destroyed by a single casualty in 1964, and a loss is sustained in that year by either or both the husband or wife, only one $100 limitation applies if a joint return is filed for 1964. If, however, the husband and wife file separate returns for 1964, the $100 limitation applies separately in respect of any loss sustained by the husband and in respect of any loss sustained by the wife. Where losses from a single casualty are sustained in two or more separate tax years, the husband and wife shall, for purposes of applying the $100 limitation to such losses, be treated as one individual for all such years if they file a joint return for the first year in which a loss is sustained from the casualty; they shall be treated as separate individuals for all such years if they file separate returns for the first such year. If a joint return is filed in the first loss year but separate returns are filed in a subsequent year, any unused portion of the $100 limitation shall be allocated equally between the husband and wife in the latter year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a loss is sustained in respect of property used partially for business and partially for nonbusiness purposes, the $100 limitation applies only to that portion of the loss properly attributable to the nonbusiness use. For example, if a taxpayer sustains a $1,000 loss in respect of an automobile which he uses 60 percent for business and 40 percent for nonbusiness, the loss is allocated 60 percent to business use and 40 percent to nonbusiness use. The $100 limitation applies to the portion of the loss allocable to the nonbusiness loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Loss sustained by an estate. A casualty loss of property not connected with a trade or business and not incurred in any transaction entered into for profit which is sustained during the settlement of an estate shall be allowed as a deduction under sections 165(a) and 641(b) in computing the taxable income of the estate if the loss has not been allowed under section 2054 in computing the taxable estate of the decedent and if the statement has been filed in accordance with Sec. 1.642(g)-1. See section 165(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Loss treated as though attributable to a trade or business. For the rule treating a casualty loss not connected with a trade or business as though it were a deduction attributable to a trade or business for purposes of computing a net operating loss, see paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of Sec. 1.172-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. The rules of this section are applicable to any taxable year beginning after January 16, 1960. If, for any taxable year beginning on or before such date, a taxpayer computed the amount of any casualty loss in accordance with the rules then applicable, such taxpayer is not required to change the amount of the casualty loss allowable for any such prior taxable year. On the other hand, the taxpayer may, if he so desires, amend his income tax return for such year to compute the amount of a casualty loss in accordance with the provisions of this section, but no provision in this section shall be construed as extending the period of limitations within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed under section 6511.
