                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section describes how to verify the dynamometer's ability to achieve targeted acceleration and deceleration rates. Paragraph (c) of this section describes how this verification applies when the dynamometer is programmed directly for a specific acceleration or deceleration rate. Paragraph (d) of this section describes how this verification applies when the dynamometer is programmed with a calculated force to achieve a targeted acceleration or deceleration rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope and frequency. Perform this verification or an equivalent procedure upon initial installation and after major maintenance that could affect acceleration and deceleration accuracy. Note that this procedure relies on proper verification of speed as described in Sec.  1066.235.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of acceleration and deceleration rates. Activate the dynamometer's function generator for measuring roll revolution frequency. If the dynamometer has no such function generator, set up a properly calibrated external function generator consistent with the verification described in this paragraph (c). Use the function generator to determine actual acceleration and deceleration rates as the dynamometer traverses speeds between 10 and 40 mph at various nominal acceleration and deceleration rates. Verify the dynamometer's acceleration and deceleration rates as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set up start and stop frequencies specific to your dynamometer by identifying the roll-revolution frequency, f, in revolutions per second (or Hz) corresponding to 10 mph and 40 mph vehicle speeds, accurate to at least four significant figures, using the following equation:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.073
Where:
v = the target roll speed, in inches per second (corresponding to drive</p><p class="depth3">speeds of 10 mph or 40 mph).n = the number of pulses from the dynamometer's roll-speed sensor per</p><p class="depth3">roll revolution.droll = roll diameter, in inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Program the dynamometer to accelerate the roll at a nominal rate of 1 mph/s from 10 mph to 40 mph. Measure the elapsed time to reach the target speed, to the nearest 0.01 s. Repeat this measurement for a total of five runs. Determine the actual acceleration rate for each run, aact, using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.074
Where:
aact = acceleration rate (decelerations have negative</p><p class="depth3">values).vfinal = the target value for the final roll speed.vinit = the setpoint value for the initial roll speed.t = time to accelerate from vinit to vfinal.
Example;
vfinal = 40 mph[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.075</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Program the dynamometer to decelerate the roll at a nominal rate of 1 mph/s from 40 mph to 10 mph. Measure the elapsed time to reach the target speed, to the nearest 0.01 s. Repeat this measurement for a total of five runs. Determine the actual acceleration rate, aact, using Eq. 1066.265-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section for additional acceleration and deceleration rates in 1 mph/s increments up to and including one increment above the maximum acceleration rate expected during testing. Average the five repeat

runs to calculate a mean acceleration rate, aact, at each setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compare each mean acceleration rate, aact, to the corresponding nominal acceleration rate, aref, to determine values for acceleration error, aerror, using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.076
Example:
aact = 0.999 mph/saref = 1 mph/s[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.077</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Verification of forces for controlling acceleration and deceleration. Program the dynamometer with a calculated force value and determine actual acceleration and deceleration rates as the dynamometer traverses speeds between 10 and 40 mph at various nominal acceleration and deceleration rates. Verify the dynamometer's ability to achieve certain acceleration and deceleration rates with a given force as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the force setting, F, using the following equation:</p><p class="depth3">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.146</p><p class="depth3">Where:
Ib = the dynamometer manufacturer's stated base inertia, in</p><p class="depth3">lbf [middot] s\2\/ft.a = nominal acceleration rate, in ft/s\2\.
Example;
Ib = 2967 lbm = 92.217 lbf [middot] s\2\/fta = 1 mph/s = 1.4667 ft/s\2\F = 92.217 [middot] [bond]1.4667[bond]F = 135.25 lbf</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Set the dynamometer to road-load mode and program it with a calculated force to accelerate the roll at a nominal rate of 1 mph/s from 10 mph to 40 mph. Measure the elapsed time to reach the target speed, to the nearest 0.01 s. Repeat this measurement for a total of five runs. Determine the actual acceleration rate, aact, for each run using Eq. 1066.265-2. Repeat this step to determine measured ``negative acceleration'' rates using a calculated force to decelerate the roll at a nominal rate of 1 mph/s from 40 mph to 10 mph. Average the five repeat runs to calculate a mean acceleration rate, aact, at each setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for additional acceleration and deceleration rates as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Compare each mean acceleration rate, aact, to the corresponding nominal acceleration rate, aref, to determine values for acceleration error, aerror, using Eq. 1066.265-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Performance evaluation. The acceleration error from paragraphs (c)(5) and (d)(4) of this section may not exceed 1.0%.</p>
