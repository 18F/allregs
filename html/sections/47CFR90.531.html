However, until December 31, 2006, channels other than those listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1), may be planned and assigned in base/mobile pairs having a different separation, where necessary because 30 MHz base/mobile pairing is precluded by the presence of one or more co-channel or adjacent channel TV/DTV broadcast stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Internal guard band. The internal guard band (768-769/798-799 MHz) is reserved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Broadband. The 758-768 MHz and 788-798 MHz bands are allocated for broadband communications.
