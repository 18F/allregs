                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A State savings association may enter into an  employment contract with its officers and other employees only in  accordance with the requirements of this section. All employment  contracts shall be in writing and shall be approved specifically by a  State savings association's board of directors. A State savings  association shall not enter into an employment contract with any of its  officers or other employees if such contract would constitute an unsafe  or unsound practice. The making of such an employment contract would be  an unsafe or unsound practice if such contract could lead to material  financial loss or damage to the State savings association or could  interfere materially with the exercise by the members of its board of  directors of their duty or discretion provided by law, charter, bylaw or  regulation as to the employment or termination of employment of an  officer or employee of the State savings association. This may occur,  depending upon the circumstances of the case, where an employment  contract provides for an excessive term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required provisions. Each employment contract shall provide  that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State savings association's board of directors may terminate  the officer or employee's employment at any time, but any termination by  the State savings association's board of directors other than  termination for cause, shall not prejudice the officer or employee's  right to compensation or other benefits under the contract. The officer  or employee shall have no right to receive compensation or other  benefits for any period after termination   for cause. Termination for cause shall include termination because of  the officer or employee's personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful  misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit,  intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any  law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar  offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any  provision of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the officer or employee is suspended and/or temporarily  prohibited from participating in the conduct of the State savings  association's affairs by a notice served under section 8(e)(3) or (g)(1)  of Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), the  State savings association's obligations under the contract shall be  suspended as of the date of service unless stayed by appropriate  proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the State  savings association may in its discretion:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pay the officer or employee all or part of the compensation  withheld while its contract obligations were suspended; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which  were suspended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the officer or employee is removed and/or permanently  prohibited from participating in the conduct of the State savings  association's affairs by an order issued under section 8 (e)(4) or  (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818 (e)(4) or  (g)(1)), all obligations of the State savings association under the  contract shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but  vested rights of the contracting parties shall not be affected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> need not be included in an  employment contract if prior written approval is secured from the FDIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All obligations under the contract shall be terminated,  except to the extent determined that continuation of the contract is  necessary of the continued operation of the State savings association</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> By the FDIC, at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement to  provide assistance to or on behalf of the State savings association  under the authority contained in 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> By the FDIC, at the time the FDIC approves a supervisory merger  to resolve problems related to operation of the State savings  association or when the State savings association is determined by the  FDIC to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any rights of the parties that have already vested, however,  shall not be affected by such action.</p>
