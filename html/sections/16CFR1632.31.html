Such record should include photographs or physical specimens.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Manufacturing specifications and description of any new ticking or tape edge material substituted in accordance with Sec. 1632.6 or Sec. 1632.7, with the identification number of the prototype involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The test results and details of any ticking classification test conducted in accordance with Sec. 1632.6, including the ticking classification (A, B, or C), the test room condition, the number of relights, whether each cigarette location passed or failed, the name and signature of the person conducting the test and the date of the test, or a certification from the ticking supplier.
