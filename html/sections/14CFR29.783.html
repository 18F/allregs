                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each closed cabin must have at least one adequate and easily  accessible external door.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each external door must be located, and appropriate operating  procedures must be established, to ensure that persons using the door  will not be endangered by the rotors, propellers, engine intakes, and  exhausts when the operating procedures are used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There must be means for locking crew and external passenger  doors and for preventing their opening in flight inadvertently or as a  result of mechanical failure. It must be possible to open external doors  from inside and outside the cabin with the rotorcraft on the ground even  though persons may be crowded against the door on the inside of the  rotorcraft. The means of opening must be simple and obvious and so  arranged and marked that it can be readily located and operated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> There must be reasonable provisions to prevent the jamming of  any external doors in a minor crash as a result of fuselage deformation  under the following ultimate inertial forces except for cargo or service  doors not suitable for use as an exit in an emergency:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upward--1.5g.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Forward--4.0g.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sideward--2.0g.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Downward--4.0g.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There must be means for direct visual inspection of the locking  mechanism by crewmembers to determine whether the external doors  (including passenger, crew, service, and cargo doors) are fully locked.  There must be visual means to signal to appropriate crewmembers when  normally used external doors are closed and fully locked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For outward opening external doors usable for entrance or  egress, there must be an auxiliary safety latching device to prevent the  door from opening when the primary latching mechanism fails. If the door  does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section with  this device in place, suitable operating procedures must be established  to prevent the use of the device during takeoff and landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If an integral stair is installed in a passenger entry door that  is qualified as a passenger emergency exit, the stair must be designed  so that under the following conditions the effectiveness of passenger  emergency egress will not be impaired:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The door, integral stair, and operating mechanism have been  subjected to the inertial forces specified in paragraph (d) of this  section, acting separately relative to the surrounding structure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rotorcraft is in the normal ground attitude and in each of  the attitudes corresponding to collapse of one or more legs, or primary  members, as applicable, of the landing gear.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Nonjettisonable doors used as ditching emergency exits must have  means to enable them to be secured in the open position and remain  secure for   emergency egress in sea state conditions prescribed for ditching.
