                            <p class="depth0">An issuing carrier filing rates or regulations for through services  between points on its own system and points on another carrier's system  (or systems), or between points on another carrier's   system (or systems), must list all concurring, connecting or other  participating carriers as provided in Sec. 61.54 (f), (g) and (h). A  concurring carrier must tender a properly executed instrument of  concurrence to the issuing carrier. If rates and regulations of the  other carriers engaging in the through service(s) are not specified in  the issuing carrier's tariff, that tariff must state where the other  carrier's rates and regulations can be found. Such reference(s) must  contain the FCC number(s) of the referenced tariff publication(s), the  exact name(s) of the carrier(s) issuing such tariff publication(s), and  must clearly state how the rates and regulations in the separate  publications apply.
