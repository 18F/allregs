                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this section, transmix means a mixture of finished fuels, such as pipeline interface, that no longer meets the specifications for a fuel that can be used or sold without further processing or handling. For the purposes of this section, pipeline interface means the mixture between different fuels that abut each other during shipment by pipeline. This section applies to refineries (or other facilities) that produce diesel fuel from transmix by distillation or other refining processes but do not produce diesel fuel by processing crude oil and to pipelines that produce diesel fuel from transmix. This section only applies to the volume of diesel fuel produced from transmix by a transmix processor using these processes, and to the diesel fuel volume produced by a pipeline operator from transmix. This section does not apply to any diesel fuel volume produced by the blending of blendstocks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> From June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard under Sec. 80.520(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beginning June 1, 2010, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is subject to the sulfur standard under Sec. 80.520(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> From June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is exempt from the standards of Sec. 80.510(a). This paragraph (c) does not apply to NRLM diesel fuel that is sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in Sec. 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> From June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2014, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the standards under Sec. 80.510(a). This paragraph (d) does not apply to NRLM diesel fuel that is sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in Sec. 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> From June 1, 2014 and beyond, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor and a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the standards of Sec. 80.510(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> From February 25, 2013 through May 31, 2014, LM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix that is sold or intended for sale in the area listed in Sec. 80.510(g)(1) is subject to the standards of Sec. 80.510(a) provided that the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section are satisfied. Diesel fuel produced from transmix that does not meet the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section is subject to the sulfur standard in Sec. 80.510(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Beginning June 1, 2014, LM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the sulfur standard of Sec. 80.510(a), provided that the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section are satisfied. Diesel fuel produced from transmix that does not meet the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section is subject to the sulfur standard in Sec. 80.510(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The following conditions must be satisfied to allow the production of 500 ppm LM under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fuel must be produced from transmix.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fuel must not be sold or intended for sale in the area listed in Sec. 80.510(g)(2) (i.e., Alaska).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A facility producing 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must obtain approval from the Administrator for a compliance plan. The compliance plan must detail how the facility will segregate any 500 ppm LM diesel fuel produced subject to

the standards under Sec. 80.510(a) from the producer through to the ultimate consumer from fuel having other designations. The compliance plan must demonstrate that the end users of 500 ppm LM will also have access to 15 ppm diesel fuel for use in those engines that require the use of 15 ppm diesel fuel. The compliance plan must identify the entities that handle the 500 ppm LM through to the ultimate consumer. No more than 4 separate entities shall handle the 500 ppm LM between the producer and the ultimate consumer. The compliance plan must also identify all ultimate consumers to whom the refiner supplies the 500 ppm LM diesel fuel. The compliance plan must detail how misfueling of 500 ppm LM into vehicles or equipment that require the use of 15 ppm diesel fuel will be prevented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Producers of 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must be registered with EPA under Sec. 80.597 prior to the distribution of any 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Producers of 500 ppm LM must initiate a PTD that meets the requirements in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All transfers of 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must be accompanied by a PTD that clearly and accurately states the fuel designation; the PTD must also meet all other requirements of Sec. 80.590.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Batches of 500 ppm LM may be shipped by pipeline provided that such batches do not come into physical contact in the pipeline with batches of other distillate fuel products that have a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The volume of 500 ppm LM shipped via pipeline under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section may swell by no more than 2% upon delivery to the next party. Such a volume increase may only be due to volume swell due to temperature differences when the volume was measured or due to normal pipeline interface cutting practices notwithstanding the requirement under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Entities that handle 500 ppm LM must calculate the balance of 500 ppm LM received versus the volume delivered and used on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The records required in this section must be maintained for five years, by each entity that handles 500 ppm LM and be made available to EPA upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All parties that take custody of 500 ppm LM must segregate the product from other fuels and observe the other requirements in the compliance plan approved by EPA pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
