                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The conformity determination must be based on the latest emission estimation model available. This criterion is satisfied if the most current version of the motor vehicle emissions model specified by EPA for use in the preparation or revision of implementation plans in that State or area is used for the conformity analysis. Where EMFAC is the motor vehicle emissions model used in preparing or revising the applicable implementation plan, new versions must be approved by EPA before they are used in the conformity analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA will consult with DOT to establish a grace period following the specification of any new model.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The grace period will be no less than three months and no more than 24 months after notice of availability is published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The length of the grace period will depend on the degree of change in the model and the scope of re-planning likely to be necessary by MPOs in order to assure conformity. If the grace period will be longer than three months, EPA will announce the appropriate grace period in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the grace period for using the MOVES2010 emissions model (and minor revisions) for regional emissions analyses will end on March 2, 2013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transportation plan and TIP conformity analyses for which the emissions analysis was begun during the grace period or before the Federal Register notice of availability of the latest emission model may continue to use the previous version of the model. Conformity determinations for projects may also be based on the previous model if the analysis was begun during the grace period or before the Federal Register notice of availability, and if the final environmental document for the project is issued no more than three years after the issuance of the draft environmental document.
