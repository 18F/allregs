The request must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copies of existing and proposed statutes, regulations, policies and other authorities of state law which comprise those aspects of the state management program outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, and, in the case of Alaska, paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A narrative discussion of the statutes, regulations, policies and other authorities which comprise those aspects of the state management program outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, and, in the case of Alaska, paragraph (d) of this section, which explains the program in terms of the requirements of the Act and the regulations of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Supplementary information as required by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for transfer of marine mammal management authority will not be approved unless it contains the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The scientific and common names and estimated range of the species of marine mammals subject to the state management program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions of state law concerning the take of marine mammals that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Require that the taking of marine mammals be humane as defined by section 3(4) of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Do not permit the taking of marine mammals until the following have occurred:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The state, pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 403.04 of this part, has determined that the species is at its Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP) and determined the maximum

number of animals that may be taken without reducing the species below its OSP, and, in the case of Alaska, when a species is below OSP, the maximum numbers that can be taken for subsistence uses while allowing the species to increase toward its OSP;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The determination as to OSP and maximum take are final and implemented under state law; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A cooperative allocation agreement, if required under Sec. 403.05(a) of this part, is implemented;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Do not permit take in excess of the maximum number of animals that may be taken as determined pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part;

This review will be advisory in nature and shall not be binding upon the Services. Notwithstanding preliminary review by the Service, once any proposed aspect of the state management program has been prepared and submitted in final form, it shall be subject to final review and approval under paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> After receiving the state's request, for management authority, the Service shall make an initial determination on whether the state's management program meets the requirements of the Act and these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After receiving the state's request, for management authority, the Service shall make an initial determination on whether the state's management program meets the requirements of the Act and these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 45 days after receiving the state's request, unless the state and the Service agree to another time period, the Service shall publish a general notice of its initial determination in the Federal Register together with, in the case of a positive determination, the text of a proposed rule to transfer management authority to the state. The general notice shall contain a summary of the major components of the state's management program and shall indicate where the full text of the management program may be inspected or copied. The public shall be allowed to submit written comments and to request an informal public hearing on the Service's initial determination and the state's management program within 60 days of publication of the general notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If requested, the Service may conduct an informal public hearing after publishing 30 days' advance notice of the date, location, and time of such hearing in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After considering all comments and other relevant information, the Service shall publish in the Federal Register its final determination on whether the state has developed and will implement a management program that meets the requirement of the Act and these regulations.
