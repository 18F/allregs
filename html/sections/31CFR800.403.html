                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Committee, acting through the Staff Chairperson, may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reject any voluntary notice that does not comply with Sec.  800.402 and so inform the parties promptly in writing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reject any voluntary notice at any time, and so inform the  parties promptly in writing, if, after the notice has been submitted and  before action by the Committee or the President has been concluded:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is a material change in the transaction as to which  notification has been made; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information comes to light that contradicts material  information provided in the notice by the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reject any voluntary notice at any time after the notice has  been accepted, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if the  party or parties that have submitted the voluntary notice do not provide  follow-up information requested by the Staff Chairperson within three  business days of the request, or within a longer time frame if the  parties so request in writing and the Staff Chairperson grants that  request in writing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reject any voluntary notice before the conclusion of a review or  investigation, and so inform the parties promptly in writing, if one of  the parties submitting the voluntary notice has not submitted the final  certification required by Sec. 800.701(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding the authority of the Staff Chairperson under  paragraph (a) of this section to reject an incomplete notice, the Staff  Chairperson may defer acceptance of the notice, and the beginning of the  thirty-day review period, to obtain any information required under this  section that has not been submitted by the notifying party or parties or  other parties to the transaction. Where necessary to obtain such  information, the Staff Chairperson may inform any non-notifying party or  parties that notice has been filed with respect to a proposed  transaction involving the party, and request that certain information  required under this section, as specified by the Staff Chairperson, be  provided to the Committee within seven days after receipt of the Staff  Chairperson's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Staff Chairperson shall notify the parties when the  Committee has found that the transaction that is the subject of a  voluntary notice is not a covered transaction.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice from  Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a company that is  owned and controlled by U.S. nationals, with respect to Corporation A's  intent to purchase all of the shares of Corporation X. The joint notice  does not contain any information described under Sec.  800.402(c)(3)(iii) and (iv) concerning classified materials and products  or services supplied to the U.S. military services. The Staff  Chairperson may reject the notice or defer the start of the thirty-day  review period until the parties have supplied the omitted information.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Same facts as in the first sentence of Example 1, except  that the joint notice indicates that Corporation A does not intend to  purchase Corporation X's Division Y, which is engaged in classified work  for a U.S. Government agency. Corporations A and X notify the Committee  on the 25th day of the 30-day notice period that Division Y will also be  acquired by Corporation A. This fact constitutes a material change with  respect to the transaction as originally notified, and the Staff  Chairperson may reject the notice.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. The Staff Chairperson receives a joint notice by  Corporation A, a foreign person, and Corporation X, a U.S. business,  indicating that Corporation A intends to purchase five percent of the  voting securities of Corporation X. Under the particular facts and  circumstances presented, the Committee concludes that Corporation A's  purchase of this interest in Corporation X could not result in foreign  control of Corporation X. The Staff Chairperson shall advise the parties  in writing that the transaction as presented is not subject to section  721.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. The Staff Chairperson receives a voluntary notice  involving the acquisition by Company A, a foreign person, of the entire  interest in Company X, a U.S. business. The notice mentions the  involvement of a second foreign person in the transaction, Company B,  but states that Company B is merely a passive investor in the  transaction. During the course of the review, the parties provide  information that clarifies that Company B has the right to appoint two  members of Company X's board of directors. This information contradicts  the material assertion in the notice that Company B is a passive  investor. The Committee may reject this notice without concluding review  under section 721.</p>
