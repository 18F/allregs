Any person (including any officers,  employee, or agent of the Board or any Federal Reserve Bank) who has  documents or information of the Board that may not be disclosed and who  is served with a subpoena, order, or other judicial or administrative  process requiring his or her personal attendance as a witness or  requiring the production of documents or information in any proceeding,  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Promptly inform the Board's General Counsel of the service and  all relevant facts, including the documents and information requested,  and any facts of assistance to the Board in determining whether the  material requested should be made available; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the appropriate time inform the court or tribunal that issued  the process and the attorney for the party at whose instance the process  was issued of the substance of these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appearance by person served. Unless the Board has authorized  disclosure of the information requested, any person who has Board  information that may not be disclosed, and who is required to respond to  a subpoena or other legal process, shall attend at the time and place  required and decline to disclose or to give any testimony with respect  to the information, basing such refusal upon the provisions of this  regulation. If the court or other body orders the disclosure of the  information or the giving of testimony, the person having the  information shall continue to decline to disclose the information and  shall promptly report the facts to the Board for such action as the  Board may deem appropriate.
