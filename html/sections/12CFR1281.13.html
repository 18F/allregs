The following transactions or activities shall not be counted for purposes of the housing goals and shall not be included in the numerator or the denominator in calculating a Bank's performance under the housing goals, even if the transaction or activity would otherwise be counted under paragraph (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchases of non-conventional single-family mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Commitments to buy mortgages at a later date or time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Options to acquire mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rights of first refusal to acquire mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any interests in mortgages that the Director determines, in writing, shall not be treated as interests in mortgages;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Mortgage purchases to the extent they finance any dwelling units that are secondary residences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Single-family refinancing mortgages that result from conversion of balloon notes to fully amortizing notes, if a Bank already owns, or has an interest in, the balloon note at the time conversion occurs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Purchases of subordinate lien mortgages (second mortgages);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Purchases of mortgages that were previously counted by a Bank under any current or previous housing goal within the five years immediately preceding the current performance year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Purchases of mortgages where the property has not been approved for occupancy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Any combination of factors in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other special rules.

A transaction or activity that is covered by more than one paragraph below must satisfy the requirements of each such paragraph.

The purchase by a Bank of HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or conditions, as defined in Sec.  1281.1, shall be treated as mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals and shall be included in the denominator for each applicable housing goal, but such mortgages shall not be counted in the numerator for any housing goal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> FHFA review of transactions. FHFA may determine whether and how any transaction or class of transactions shall be counted for purposes of the housing goals.
