                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>. In certain specified  circumstances, information contained in the in-process files may be  obtained by complying with the procedures of 37 CFR 201.2(b)(3).  Correspondence between a copyright claimant or his or her agent and the  Copyright Office in a completed registration, recordation, or refusal to  register is also available for public inspection. Section 201.2(d) of  this chapter prescribes the method for requesting copies of copyright  registration records. An attorney engaged in actual or prospective  litigation who submits a court order or a completed Litigation Statement  may obtain a copy of the deposit if his or her request is found to  comply with the requirements set out in 37 CFR 201.2(d)(2). The fees  associated with various document requests, searches, copies, and  expedited handling are listed in 37 CFR 201.3. Other publications  containing Copyright Office procedures and practices are available to  the public without charge from the Copyright Office or its Web site:  http://www.copyright.gov. The Office website   also allows online searching of copyright registration information and  information pertaining to documents recorded with the Copyright Office  beginning January 1, 1978. Pre-1978 copyright registration information  and document recordation information is available to the public in the  Copyright Office during regular business hours. If the information  sought to be obtained from the Office is not available through these  Office services, demands and subpoenas for testimony or documents may be  served as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Demands for testimony or documents. All demands, requests,  subpoenas or orders for production of documents or testimony in a legal  proceeding directed to the Copyright Office, the Register of Copyrights  or any other Copyright Office employee in his or her official capacity  must be in writing and should be served on the General Counsel of the  Copyright Office as indicated in Sec.  205.2 of this part and in  accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Affidavits. Except when the Copyright Office is a party to the  legal proceeding, every demand, request or subpoena shall be accompanied  by an affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28  U.S.C. 1746. Such affidavit or declaration shall contain a written  statement setting forth the title of the legal proceeding; the forum;  the requesting party's interest in the legal proceeding; the reasons for  the demand, request, or subpoena; a showing that the desired testimony  or document is not reasonably available from any published or other  written source, (e.g., 37 CFR, Chapter II; Compendium II, Compendium of  Copyright Office Practices; other written practices of the Office;  circulars; the Copyright Office website) and is not available by other  established procedure, e.g., 37 CFR 201.2, 201.3. If testimony is  requested in the affidavit or declaration, it shall include the intended  use of the testimony, a detailed summary of the testimony desired, and a  showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of the  requested testimony. The purpose of these requirements is to permit the  Copyright General Counsel to make an informed decision as to whether  testimony or production of a document should be authorized. The decision  by the General Counsel will be based on consideration of the purposes  set forth in Sec.  205.21(b) of this part, on the evaluation of the  requesting party's need for the testimony and any other factor warranted  by the circumstances. Typically, when the information requested is  available through other existing Office procedures or materials, the  General Counsel will not authorize production of documents or testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No Copyright Office employee shall give testimony concerning the  official business of the Office or produce any document in a legal  proceeding other than those made available by the Records Research and  Certification Section under existing regulations without the prior  authorization of the General Counsel. Without prior approval from the  General Counsel, no Office employee shall answer inquiries from a person  not employed by the Library of Congress or the Department of Justice  regarding testimony or documents in connection with a demand, subpoena  or order. All inquiries involving demands, subpoenas, or orders shall be  directed to the Copyright General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any Office employee who receives a demand, request, subpoena or  order for testimony or the production of documents in a legal proceeding  shall immediately notify the Copyright Office General Counsel at the  phone number indicated in Sec.  205.2 of this part and shall immediately  forward the demand to the Copyright General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The General Counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney  for a party or the party, if not represented by an attorney, to refine  or limit a demand, request or subpoena to address interests or concerns  of the Office. Failure of the attorney or party to cooperate in good  faith under this part may serve as the basis for the General Counsel to  deny authorization for the testimony or production of documents sought  in the demand.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A determination under this part regarding authorization to  respond to a demand is not an assertion or waiver of privilege, lack of  relevance, technical   deficiency or any other ground for noncompliance. The Copyright Office  reserves the right to oppose any demand on any appropriate legal ground  independent of any determination under this part, including but not  limited to, sovereign immunity, preemption, privilege, lack of  relevance, or technical deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Office procedures when an employee receives a demand or  subpoena:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the General Counsel has not acted by the return date, the  employee must appear at the time and place set forth in the subpoena  (unless otherwise advised by the General Counsel) and inform the court  (or other legal authority) that the demand has been referred for the  prompt consideration of the General Counsel and shall request the court  (or other legal authority) to stay the demand pending receipt of the  requested instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the General Counsel makes a determination not to authorize  testimony or the production of documents, but the subpoena is not  withdrawn or modified and Department of Justice representation cannot be  arranged, the employee should appear at the time and place set forth in  the subpoena unless advised otherwise by the General Counsel. If legal  counsel cannot appear on behalf of the employee, the employee should  produce a copy of these rules and state that the General Counsel has  advised the employee not to provide the requested testimony or to  produce the requested document. If a court (or other legal authority)  rules that the demand in the subpoena must be complied with, the  employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing  United States ex rel.Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).  [69 FR 39334, June 30, 2004, as amended at 73 FR 37840, July 2, 2008]</p>
