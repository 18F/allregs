In such a case, the district director shall not permit the development or submission of any additional medical evidence until after he has made a final determination of the identity of the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits. If the operator who is finally determined to be the responsible operator has not had the opportunity to submit medical evidence pursuant to Sec. 725.410, the district director shall allow the designated responsible operator and the claimant not less than 60 days within which to submit evidence relevant to the claimant's

eligibility for benefits. The designated responsible operator may elect to adopt any medical evidence previously submitted by another operator as its own evidence, subject to the limitations of Sec. 725.414. The district director may also schedule a conference in accordance with Sec. 725.416, issue a proposed decision and order in accordance with Sec. 725.418, or take such other action as the district director considers appropriate.</p>
