                            <p class="depth0">Admission to the School of Medicine of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences is on a competitive basis, with selection predicated on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evidence of sound character and high motivation for a career in the Medical Corps of the Uniformed Services, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evidence of sufficient intellectual ability and preparation to undertake successfully the study of medicine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Academic requirements. Recognizing that Service medicine needs individuals with a wide variety of interests and talents, the School of Medicine welcomes applications from individuals with a diversity of educational backgrounds. However, there are certain specific academic requirements that are requisite for admission. These are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> College preparation. All applicants must have attained a baccalaureate degree from an accredited academic institution prior to matriculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prerequisite course work. Area of specialization in college is not a limiting factor in gaining admission to the School, but a strong foundation in the sciences basic to the study of medicine is a requirement for all entering students. The minimum undergraduate science prerequisites for entrance are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Chemistry (inorganic or general). 1 academic year including appropriate laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Organic chemistry. 1 academic year including laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mathematics. 1 academic year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Physics. 1 academic year including laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Biology. 1 academic year including laboratory.
An academic year of course work equates to that course work which extends over a two-semester or three-quarter period and carries a total credit of between 6 to 8 semester hours or 9 to 12 quarter hours. No application will be considered unless the applicant has completed the science prerequisites or is in the process of completing the last 8 semester hours (or 12 quarter hours) of these courses at time of making application.
In addition to the science requirements, all applicants must complete 6 semester hours (or the equivalent) of college English before matriculating. While the foregoing represent the minimum academic prerequisites for admission, preference generally will be shown to applicants who also have had some college course work in the humanities and/or the social and behavioral sciences, for these disciplines complement the study of medicine, contributing to an understanding of human behavior both in sickness and health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Testing requirements. Applicants for admission are required to have taken the Medical College Admission Test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of character and motivation. Judgments about character and motivation will be based on letters of reference, personal statements, evaluation reports, personality inventories, interviews, and such other credentials/techniques necessary, as determined by the School of Medicine, to assess thoroughly the noncognitive nature and potential of the aspirant. The School of Medicine will take the initiative in gathering data upon which to make noncognitive assessments of applicants.</p>
