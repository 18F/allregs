Included also are the qualifications required by the Commission for issuance of a Certificate (Performance) and the basis for the denial, revocation, modification, or suspension of such Certificates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to comply with this part may result in denial of an application for a certificate. Vessels operating without the proper certificate may be denied clearance by the Department of Homeland Security and their owners may also be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 in addition to a civil penalty of $200 for each passage sold, such penalties to be assessed by the Federal Maritime Commission (46 U.S.C. 44101-44106, 60105).
