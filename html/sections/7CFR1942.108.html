All applicants must complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 442-7, ``Operating Budget,'' except as provided in this paragraph. Applicants with annual incomes not exceeding $100,000 may, with concurrence of the District Director, use Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1942-52, ``Cash Flow Projection,'' instead of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-

354 442-7. Projections should be provided for the current year and each year thereafter until the facility is expected to have been in operation for a full year and a full annual installment paid on the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Letter of conditions.

The processing office should request advice and assistance from the State Office as needed. The State Director may require all or part of a specific application docket to be submitted to the State Office for review at any time. The State Director may determine that one or more of the processing office staffs do not have adequate training and expertise to routinely complete application dockets without State Office review. In such cases, the State Director should establish guidelines by memorandum or by State supplement to the subpart for the necessary State Office reviews.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Loan approval and fund obligation. Loans must be approved and obligated in accordance with Sec. 1942.5(d) of subpart A of this part 1942 and subpart A of part 1901 of this chapter.
