                                Sec. 61.32  Per diem application packages--rating criteria.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditional selection. Application packages for per diem only  (i.e., from non-capital grant applicants) in response to a Notice of  Fund Availability (NOFA) will be reviewed and grouped in categories  according to the funding priorities set forth in the NOFA, if any. Such  applications will then be ranked within their respective funding  category according to scores achieved only if the applicant scores at  least 750 cumulative points out of a possible 1000 from each of the  following paragraphs: (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of Sec. 61.13.  The highest-ranked applications for which funding is available, within  highest funding priority category if applicable, will be conditionally  selected for eligibility to receive per diem payments or special need  payment in accordance with their ranked order. If funding priorities  have been established and funds are still available after selection of  those applicants in the highest priority group, VA will continue to  conditionally select applicants in lower priority categories in  accordance with the selection method set forth in this paragraph subject  to available funding. Conditional selectees will be subsequently awarded  per diem, if they otherwise meet the requirements of this part,  including passing the inspection required by Sec. 61.80.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ranking applications. In the event of a tie between applicants,  VA will use the score from Sec. 61.13(g) to determine the ranking.  Note: Capital grant recipients are not required to be ranked; however,  continuation of per diem payments to capital grant recipients will be  subject to limitations set forth in Sec. 61.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Executing per diem agreements. VA will execute per diem  agreements with an applicant whose per diem application was  conditionally selected under this section using the same procedures  applicable to a capital grant under Sec. 61.15.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 2012)</p>
