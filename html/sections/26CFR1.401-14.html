                                Sec. 1.401-14  Inclusion of medical benefits for retired employees
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Under section 401(h) a qualified pension or  annuity plan may make provision for the payment of sickness, accident,  hospitalization, and medical expenses for retired employees, their  spouses, and their dependents. The term ``medical benefits described in  section 401(h)'' is used in this section to describe such payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coverage. Under section 401(h), a qualified  pension or annuity plan may provide for the payment of medical benefits  described in section 401(h) only for retired employees, their spouses,  or their dependents. To be ``retired'' for purposes of eligibility to  receive medical benefits described in section 401(h), an employee must  be eligible to receive retirement benefits provided under the pension  plan, or else be retired by an employer providing such medical benefits  by reason of permanent disability. For purposes of the preceding  sentence, an employee is not considered to be eligible to receive  retirement benefits provided under the plan if he is still employed by  the employer and a separation from employment is a condition to  receiving the retirement benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discrimination. A plan which provides medical benefits described  in section 401(h) must not discriminate in favor of officers,  shareholders, supervisory employees, or highly compensated employees  with respect to coverage and with respect to the contributions or  benefits under the plan. The determination of whether such a plan so  discriminates is made with reference to the retirement portion of the  plan as well as the portion providing the medical benefits described in  section 401(h). Thus, for example, a plan will not be qualified under  section 401 if it discriminates in favor of employees who are officers  or shareholders with respect to either portion of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Funding medical benefits. Contributions to provide the medical  benefits described in section 401(h) may be made either on a  contributory or noncontributory basis, without regard to whether the  contributions to fund the retirement benefits are made on a similar  basis. Thus, for example, the contributions to fund the medical benefits  described in section 401(h) may be provided for entirely out of employer  contributions even though the retirement benefits under the plan are  determined on the basis of both employer and employee contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 401(h) and this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term dependent shall have the same meaning as that assigned  to it by section 152, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term medical expense means expenses for medical care as  defined in section 213(e)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirements. The requirements which must be met for a qualified  pension or annuity plan to provide medical benefits described in section  401(h) are set forth in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Benefits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan must specify the medical benefits  described in section 401(h) which will be available and must contain  provisions for determining the amount which will be paid. Such benefits,  when added to any life insurance protection provided for under the plan,  must be subordinate to the retirement benefits provided by such plan.  For purposes of this section, life insurance protection includes any  benefit paid under the plan on behalf of an employee-participant as a  result of the employee-participant's death to the extent such payment  exceeds the amount of the reserve to provide the retirement benefits for  the employee-participant existing at his death. The medical benefits  described in section 401(h) are considered subordinate to the retirement  benefits if at all times the aggregate of contributions (made after   the date on which the plan first includes such medical benefits) to  provide such medical benefits and any life insurance protection does not  exceed 25 percent of the aggregate contributions (made after such date)  other than contributions to fund past service credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The meaning of the term subordinate may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The X Corporation amends its qualified pension plan to  provide medical benefits described in section 401(h) effective for the  taxable year 1964. The total contributions under the plan (excluding  those for past service credits) for the taxable year 1964 are $125,000,  allocated as follows: $100,000 for retirement benefits, $10,000 for life  insurance protection, and $15,000 for medical benefits described in  section 401(h). The medical benefits described in section 401(h) are  considered subordinate to the retirement benefits since the portion of  the contributions allocated to the medical benefits described in section  401(h) ($15,000) and to life insurance protection after such medical  benefits were included in the plan ($10,000), or $25,000, does not  exceed 25 percent of $125,000. For the taxable year 1965, the X  Corporation contributes $140,000 (exclusive of contributions for past  service credits) allocated as follows: $100,000 for retirement benefits,  $10,000 for life insurance protection, and $30,000 for medical benefits  described in section 401(h). The medical benefits described in section  401(h) are considered subordinate to the retirement benefits since the  aggregate contributions allocated to the medical benefits described in  section 401(h) ($45,000) and to life insurance protection after such  medical benefits were included in the plan ($20,000) or $65,000 does not  exceed 25 percent of $265,000, the aggregate of the contributions made  in 1964 and 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate accounts. Where medical benefits described in section  401(h) are provided for under a qualified pension or annuity plan, a  separate account must be maintained with respect to contributions to  fund such benefits. The separation required by this section is for  recordkeeping purposes only. Consequently, the funds in the medical  benefits account need not be separately invested. They may be invested  with funds set aside for retirement purposes without identification of  which investment properties are allocable to each account. However,  where the investment properties are not allocated to each account, the  earnings on such properties must be allocated to each account in a  reasonable manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reasonable and ascertainable. Section 401(h) further requires  that amounts contributed to fund medical benefits therein described must  be reasonable and ascertainable. For the rules relating to the deduction  of such contributions, see paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.404(a)-3. The  employer must, at the time he makes a contribution, designate that  portion of such contribution allocable to the funding of medical  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Impossibility of diversion prior to satisfaction of all  liabilities. Section 401(h) further requires that it must be impossible,  at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan  to provide for the payment of medical benefits described in section  401(h), for any part of the corpus or income of the medical benefits  account to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or  diverted to, any purpose other than the providing of such benefits.  Consequently, a plan which, for example, under its terms, permits funds  in the medical benefits account to be used for any retirement benefit  provided under the plan does not satisfy the requirements of section  401(h) and will not qualify under section 401(a). However, the payment  of any necessary or appropriate expenses attributable to the  administration of the medical benefits account does not affect the  qualification of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reversion upon satisfaction of all liabilities. The plan must  provide that any amounts which are contributed to fund medical benefits  described in section 401(h) and which remain in the medical benefits  account upon the satisfaction of all liabilities arising out of the  operation of the medical benefits portion of the plan are to be returned  to the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Forfeitures. The plan must expressly provide that in the event  an individual's interest in the medical benefits account is forfeited  prior to termination of the plan an amount equal to the amount of the  forfeiture must be applied as soon as possible to reduce employer  contributions to fund the medical benefits described in section 401(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section applies to taxable years of a  qualified pension or annuity plan beginning after October 23, 1962.  [T.D. 6722, 29 FR 5072, Apr. 14, 1964]    Sec. 1.401(a)-1  Post-ERISA qualified plans and qualified trusts;  in general.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section and the following  regulation sections under section 401 reflect the provisions of section  401 after amendment by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of  1974 (Pub. L. 93-406) (``ERISA'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> merely because the  plan provides, in accordance with section 401(a)(36), that a  distribution may be made from the plan to an employee who has attained  age 62 and who is not separated from employment at the time of such  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(i), a pre-ERISA regulation, provides  rules applicable to this requirement, and that regulation is applicable  except as otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The use of the type of plan provision described in Sec.  1.415(a)-1(d)(1) which automatically freezes or reduces the rate of  benefit accrual or the annual addition to insure that the limitations of  section 415 will not be exceeded, will not be considered to violate the  requirements of this subparagraph provided that the operation of such  provision precludes discretion by the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Normal retirement age--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The normal retirement  age under a plan must be an age that is not earlier than the earliest  age that is reasonably representative of the typical retirement age for  the industry in which the covered workforce is employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Age 62 safe harbor. A normal retirement age under a plan that  is age 62 or later is deemed to be not earlier than the earliest age  that is reasonably representative of the typical retirement age for the  industry in which the covered workforce is employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Age 55 to age 62. In the case of a normal retirement age that  is not earlier than age 55 and is earlier than age 62, whether the age  is not earlier than the earliest age that is reasonably representative  of the typical retirement age for the industry in which the covered  workforce is employed is based on all of the relevant facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under age 55. A normal retirement age that is lower than age 55  is presumed to be earlier than the earliest age that is reasonably  representative of the typical retirement age for the industry in which  the covered workforce is employed, unless the Commissioner determines  that under the facts and circumstances the normal retirement age is not  earlier than the earliest age that is reasonably representative of the  typical retirement age for the industry in which the covered workforce  is employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Age 50 safe harbor for qualified public safety employees. A  normal retirement age under a plan that is age 50 or later is deemed to  be not earlier than the earliest age that is reasonably representative  of the typical retirement age for the industry in which the covered  workforce is employed if substantially all of the participants in the  plan are qualified public safety employees (within the meaning of  section 72(t)(10)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Benefit distribution prior to retirement. For purposes of  paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, retirement does not include a mere  reduction in the number of hours that an employee works. Accordingly,  benefits may not be distributed prior to normal retirement age solely  due to a reduction in the number of hours that an employee works.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>, paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section are effective May 22,  2007. In the case of a   governmental plan (as defined in section 414(d)), paragraphs (b)(2) and  (3) of this section are effective for plan years beginning on or after  January 1, 2009. In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to one or  more collective bargaining agreements that have been ratified and are in  effect on May 22, 2007, paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section do not  apply before the first plan year that begins after the last of such  agreements terminate determined without regard to any extension thereof  (or, if earlier, May 24, 2010. See Sec. 1.411(d)-4, A-12, for a special  transition rule in the case of a plan amendment that increases a plan's  normal retirement age pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.  [T.D. 7748, 46 FR 1695, Jan. 7, 1981, as amended by T.D. 9319, 72 FR  16894, Apr. 5, 2007; T.D. 9325, 72 FR 28606, May 22, 2007]    Sec. 1.401(a)-2  Impossibility of diversion under qualified plan or  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em> and that regulation  is applicable except as otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 415 suspense account. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of  this section, a plan, or trust forming part of a plan, may provide for  the reversion to the employer, upon termination of the plan, of amounts  contributed to the plan that exceed the limitations imposed under  section 415(c), to the extent set forth in rules prescribed by the  Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in  the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).  [T.D. 7748, 46 FR 1696, Jan. 7, 1981, as amended by T.D. 9319, 72 FR  16894, Apr. 5, 2007]    Sec. 1.401(a)-4  Optional forms of benefit (before 1994).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: How does section 401(a)(4) apply to optional forms of benefits?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. The nondiscrimination requirements  of section 401(a)(4) apply to the amount of contributions or benefits,  optional forms of benefit, and other benefits, rights and features  (e.g., actuarial assumptions, methods of benefit calculation, loans,  social security supplements, and disability benefits) under a plan. This  section addresses the application of section 401(a)(4) only to optional  forms of benefit under a plan. Generally, the determination of whether  an optional form is nondiscriminatory under section 401(a)(4) is made by  reference to the availability of such optional form, and not by  reference to the utilization or actual receipt of such optional form.  See Q&A-2; of this section. Even though an optional form of benefit under  a plan may be nondiscriminatory under section 401(a)(4) and this Sec.  1.401(a)-4 because the availability of such optional form does not  impermissibly favor employees in the highly compensated group, such plan  may fail to satisfy section 401(a)(4) with respect to the amount of  contributions or benefits or with respect to other benefits, rights and  features if, for example, the method of calculation or the amount or  value of benefits payable under such optional form impermissibly favors  the highly compensated group. See Sec. 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-1; for the  definition of ``optional form of benefit.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nondiscrimination requirements. Each optional form of benefit  provided under a plan is subject to the nondiscrimination requirement of  section 401(a)(4) and thus the availability of each optional form of  benefit must not discriminate in favor of the employees described in  section 401(a)(4) in whose favor discrimination is prohibited (the  ``highly compensated group''). See paragraph (b) of this Q&A-1; for a  description of the employees included in such group. This is true  without regard to whether a particular optional form of benefit is the  actuarial equivalent of any other optional form of benefit under the  plan. Thus, for example, a plan may not condition, or otherwise   limit, the availability of a single sum distribution of an employee's  benefit in a manner that impermissibly favors the highly compensated  group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Highly compensated group. For plan years commencing prior to the  applicable effective date for the amendment made to section 401(a)(4) by  section 1114 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86), the highly  compensated group consists of those employees who are officers,  shareholders, or highly compensated. For plan years beginning on or  after the applicable effective date of the amendments to section  401(a)(4) made by TRA '86, the highly compensated group consists of  those employees who are highly compensated within the meaning of section  414(q). The amendment to section 401(a)(4) made by section 1114 of TRA  '86 is generally effective for plan years commencing after December 31,  1988. See section 1114(a) of TRA '86.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: How is it determined whether an optional form of benefit  satisfies the nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4)?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An optional  form of benefit under a plan is nondiscriminatory under section  401(a)(4) only if the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of  this Q&A-2; are satisfied with respect to such optional form. The  determination of whether an optional form of benefit satisfies these  requirements is made by reference to the availability of the optional  form, and not by reference to the utilization or actual receipt of such  optional form. Thus, an optional form of benefit that satisfies the  requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this Q&A-2; is  nondiscriminatory under section 401(a)(2) even though the highly  compensated group disproportionately utilizes such optional form.  However, the composition of the group of employees who actually receive  benefits in an optional form may be relevant in determining whether such  optional form satisfies the requirement of paragraph (a)(3) of this Q&A-; 2 with respect to effective availability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Current availability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plan years prior to TRA '86 effective  date. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this Q&A-2;, for  plan years prior to the effective date of the amendments made to section  401(b) by section 1112(a) of TRA '86, the requirement of this paragraph  (a)(2) is satisfied only if the group of employees to whom the optional  form is currently available satisfies either the seventy percent test of  section 410(b)(1)(A) or the nondiscriminatory classification test of  section 410(b)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> in order for the optional  form to be currently available to a nondiscriminatory group of  employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for certain governmental or church plans. Plans  described in section 410(c) will be treated as satisfying the current  availability test of this paragraph (a)(2) if the group of employees  with respect to whom the optional form is currently available satisfies  the requirements of section 401(a)(3) as in effect on September 1, 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective data for TRA '86 amendments to section 410(b). The  amendments to section 410(b) made by section 1112(a) of TRA '86 are  generally effective for plan years commencing after December 31, 1988.  See section 1112(e)(1) of TRA '86.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Elimination of optional forms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Notwithstanding  paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this Q&A-2;, in the case of an  optional form of benefit that has been eliminated under a plan with  respect to specified employees for benefits accrued after the later of  the eliminating amendment's adoption date or effective date, the  determination of whether such optional form satisfies this paragraph  (a)(2) with respect   to such employees is to be made immediately prior to the elimination.  Accordingly, if, as of the later of the adoption date or effective date  of an amendment eliminating an optional form with respect to future  benefit accruals, the current availability of such optional form  immediately prior to such amendment satisfies this paragraph (a)(2),  then the optional form will be treated as satisfying this paragraph  (a)(2) for all subsequent years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example. A profit-sharing plan that provides for a single sum  distribution available to all employees on termination of employment is  amended January 1, 1990, to eliminate such single sum optional form of  benefit with respect to benefits accrued after January 1, 1991. As of  January 1, 1991, the single sum optional form of benefit is available to  a group of employees that satisfies the percentage test of section  410(b)(1)(A). As of January 1, 1995, all nonhighly compensated employees  who were entitled to the single sum optional form of benefit have  terminated from employment with the employer and taken a distribution of  their benefits. The only remaining employees who have a right to take a  portion of their benefits in the form of a single sum distribution on  termination of employment are highly compensated employees. Because the  availability of the single sum optional form of benefit satisfied the  current availability test as of January 1, 1991, the availability of  such optional form of benefit is deemed to continue to satisfy the  current availability test of this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> is satisfied only if, based on the facts and  circumstances, the group of employees to whom the optional form is  effectively available does not substantially favor the highly  compensated group. This is the case even if the optional form is, or has  been, currently available to a group of employees that satisfies the  applicable requirements in paragraph (a)(2) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> or (ii) of this Q&A-2.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this Q&A-2;  can be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer X maintains a defined benefit plan that covers  both of the 2 highly compensated employees of the employer and 8 of the  twelve nonhighly compensated employees of the employer. Plan X provides  for a normal retirement benefit payable as an annuity and based on a  normal retirement age of 65, and an early retirement benefit payable  upon termination in the form of an annuity to employees who terminate  from service with the employer on or after age 55 with 30 or more years  of service. Each of the 2 employees of employer X who are in the highly  compensated group currently meet the age and service requirement, or  will have 30 years of service by the time they reach age 55. All but 2  of the 8 nonhighly compensated employees of employer X who are covered  by the plan were hired on or after age 35 and thus, cannot qualify for  the early retirement benefit provision. Even though the group of  employees to whom the early retirement benefit is currently available  does not impermissibly favor the highly compensated group by reason of  disregarding age and service, these facts and circumstances indicate  that the effective availability of the early retirement benefit in plan  X substantially favors the highly compensated group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that the  early retirement benefit is added by a plan amendment first adopted,  announced and effective December 1, 1991, and is available only to  employees who terminate from employment with the employer prior to  December 15, 1991. Further assume that all employees were hired prior to  attaining age 25, and that the group of employees who have, or will have  attained age 55 with 30 years of service, by December 15, 1991,  satisfies the ratio test of section 410(b)(1)(B). Finally, assume that  the only employees who terminate from employment with the employer  during the two week period in which the early retirement benefit is  available are employees in the highly compensated group. These facts and  circumstances indicate that the effective availability of the early  retirement benefit substantially favors the highly compensated group.  This is the case even though the limitation of the early retirement  benefit to a specified period satisfies section 411(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employer Y amends plan Y on June 30, 1990, to provide for  a single sum distribution for employees who terminate from employment  with the employer after June 30, 1990, and prior to January 1, 1991. The  availability of this single sum distribution is conditioned on the  employee having a particular disability at the time of termination of  employment. The only employee of the employer who meets this disability  requirement at the time of the amendment and thereafter through December  31, 1990, is a highly compensated employee. Generally, a disability  condition with respect to the availability of a single sum distribution  may   be disregarded in determining whether the current availability of such  optional form of benefit is discriminatory. However, these facts and  circumstances indicate that the effective availability of the optional  form of benefit substantially favors the highly compensated group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Employer Z maintains a money purchase pension plan that  covers all employees of the employer. The plan provides for distribution  in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, a life annuity, or equal  installments over 10 years. During the 1992 calendar year the employer  winds up his business. In December of 1992, only two employees remain in  the employment of the employer, both of whom are highly compensated.  Employer Z then amends the plan to provide for a single sum distribution  to employees who terminate from employment on or after the date of the  amendment. Both highly compensated employees terminate from employment  on December 31, 1992, taking a single sum distribution of their  benefits. These facts and circumstances indicate that the effective  availability of the single sum optional form of benefit substantially  favors the highly compensated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of tests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Current availability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), in determining  whether an optional form of benefit that is subject to specified  eligibility conditions is currently available to an employee for  purposes of paragraph (a) of this Q&A-2;, the determination of current  availability generally is to be based on the current facts and  circumstances with respect to the employee (e.g., the employee's current  compensation or the employee's current net worth). Thus, for example,  the fact that an employee may, in the future, satisfy an eligibility  condition generally does not cause an optional form of benefit to be  treated as currently available to such employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions for age, service, employment termination and certain  other conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Age and service conditions. For purposes of  applying paragraph (a)(2) of this Q&A-2;, except as provided in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this Q&A-2;, an age condition, a service condition, or  both are to be disregarded. For example, an employer that maintains a  plan that provides for an early retirement benefit payable as an annuity  for employees in division A, subject to a requirement that the employee  has attained his or her 55th birthday and has at least twenty years of  service with the employer, is to disregard the age and service  conditions in determining the group of employees to whom the early  retirement annuity benefit is currently available. Thus, the early  retirement annuity benefit is treated as currently available to all  employees of division A, without regard to their ages or years of  service and without regard to whether they could potentially meet the  age and service conditions prior to attaining the plan's normal  retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for certain age and service conditions. Age and  service conditions that must be satisfied within a specified period of  time may not be disregarded pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this  Q&A-2.; However, in determining the current availability of an optional  form of benefit subject to such an age condition, service condition, or  both, an employer may project the age and service of employees to the  last date on which the optional form of benefit subject to the age  condition or service condition (or both) is available under the plan. An  employer's ability to protect age and service to the last date on which  the optional form of benefit is available under the plan is not cut off  by a plan termination occurring prior to that date. Thus, for example,  assume that an employer maintaining a plan that permits employees  terminating from employment on or after age 55 between June 1, 1991 to  May 31, 1992, to elect a single sum distribution, decides to terminate  the plan on December 31, 1991. In determining the group of employees to  whom the single sum optional form of benefit is currently available,  this employer may project employees' ages through May 31, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certain other conditions disregarded. Conditions on the  availability of optional forms of benefit requiring termination of  employment, death, satisfaction of a specified health condition (or  failure to meet such condition), disability, hardship, marital status,  default on a plan loan secured by a participant's account balance, or  execution of a covenant not to compete may be disregarded in determining  the group of employees to whom an optional form of benefit is currently  available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employees taken into account. For purposes of applying paragraph  (a) of this Q&A-2;, the tests are to be applied on the basis of the  employer's nonexcludable employees (whether or not they are participants  in the plan) in the same manner as such tests would be applied in  determining whether the plan providing the optional form of benefit  satisfies the tests under section 410(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of ``plan''. For purposes of applying paragraph (a)  of this Q&A-2;, the term ``plan'' has the meaning that such term has for  purposes of determining whether the amount of contributions or benefits  and whether other benefits, rights, and features are nondiscriminatory  under section 401(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Restructuring optional forms of benefit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this Q&A-2;, the availability of  two or more optional forms of benefit under a plan may be tested by  restructuring such benefits into two or more restructured optional forms  of benefit and testing the availability of such restructured optional  forms of benefit. If two or more optional forms of benefit under a plan  contain both common and distinct components, such optional forms of  benefit may be restructured as a single optional form of benefit  comprising the common component, and one or more optional forms of  benefit comprising each distinct component. Components of optional forms  of benefit may be treated as common only if they are identical with  respect to all characteristics taken into account under Q&A-1;(b) of  Sec. 1.411(d)-4. The availability of each restructured optional form of  benefit must satisfy the applicable nondiscrimination requirements of  paragraph (a) of this Q&A-2.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. A profit-sharing plan covering all the employees of an  employer provides a single sum distribution option upon termination from  employment for all employees earning less than $50,000 and a single sum  distribution option upon termination from employment after the  attainment of age 55 for all employees earning $50,000 or more. These  distribution options are identical in all other respects. For purposes  of applying section 401(a)(4), such optional forms of benefit may be  restructured into two different optional forms of benefit: (A) a single  sum distribution option upon termination from employment after the  attainment of age 55 for all employees (i.e., the common component), and  (B) a single sum distribution option upon termination from employment  before the attainment of age 55 for all employees earning less than  $50,000. The availability of each of these restructured optional forms  of benefit must satisfy section 401(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Commissioner may provide additional tests. The Commissioner may  provide such additional factors, tests, and safe harbors as are  necessary or appropriate for purposes of determining whether the  availability of an optional form of benefit is discriminatory under  section 401(a)(4). In addition, the Commissioner may provide that  additional eligibility conditions not related directly or indirectly to  compensation or wealth may be disregarded under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C)  of this Q&A-2; in determining the current availability of an optional  form of benefit. The Commissioner may provide such additional guidance  only through the publication of revenue rulings, notices or other  documents of general applicability.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: May a plan condition the availability of an optional form of  benefit on employer discretion?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: No. Even if the availability of an optional form of benefit  that is conditioned on employer discretion satisfies the  nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4), the plan providing  the optional form of benefit will fail to satisfy certain other  requirements of section 401(a), including, in applicable circumstances,  the definitely determinable requirement of section 401(a) and the  requirements of section 401(a)(25) and section 411(d)(6). See Sec.  1.411(d)-4.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Will a plan provision violate section 401(a)(4) merely because  it requires that an employee who terminates from service with the  employer receive a single sum distribution in the event that the present  value of the employee's benefit is not more than $3,500, as permitted by  sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e)?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: No. A plan will not be treated as discriminatory under section  401(a)(4) merely because the plan mandates a single sum distribution  when the present value of an employee's benefit is not more than $3,500,  as permitted by sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e). This is an exception to  the general principles of this section. (No similar provision exists  excepting such single sum distributions from the limits on employer  discretion under section 411(d)(6). See Sec. 1.411(d)-4 Q&A-4.;)</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: If the availability of an optional form of benefit  discriminates, or may reasonably be expected to discriminate, in favor  of the highly compensated group, what acceptable alternatives exist for  amending the plan without violating section 411(d)(6)?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The following rules  apply for purposes of making necessary amendments to existing plans (as  defined in Q&A-6; of this section) under which the availability of an  optional form of benefit violates the nondiscrimination requirements of  section 401(a)(4) or may reasonably be expected to violate such  requirements. These transitional rules are provided under the authority  of section 411(d)(6), which allows the elimination of certain optional  forms of benefit if permitted by regulations, and section 7805(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nondiscrimination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The determination of whether  the availability of an optional form of benefit violates section  401(a)(4) is to be made in accordance with Q&A-2; of this section. In  addition, the availability of a particular optional form of benefit may  reasonably be expected to violate the nondiscrimination requirements of  section 401(a)(4) if, under the applicable facts and circumstances,  there is a significant possibility that the current availability of such  optional form of benefit will impermissibly favor the highly compensated  group. This determination must be made on the basis of the seventy  percent test of section 410(b)(1)(A) or the nondiscriminatory  classification test of section 410(b)(1)(B) as such tests existed prior  to the effective date of the amendments made to section 410(b) by  section 1112(a) of TRA '86. Thus, a condition may not reasonably be  expected to discriminate for purposes of these rules merely because it  results in a significant possibility that discrimination will result  because of the amendments made to section 410(b) by section 1112(a) of  TRA '86. In addition, the availability of an optional form of benefit  may not reasonably be expected to discriminate merely because of an age  or service condition that may be disregarded in determining the current  availability of such optional form of benefit under paragraph  (b)(1)(ii)(A) of Q&A-2; of this section. Similarly, the availability of  an optional form of benefit may not reasonably be expected to  discriminate merely because of an age or service condition that, after  permitted projection, does not cause such optional form to fail to  satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this Q&A-5;  can be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A plan provides that a single sum distribution option is  available only to (A) employees earning $50,000 or more in the final  year of employment, (B) employees who furnish evidence that they have a  net worth above a certain specified amount, and (C) employees who  present a letter from an accountant or attorney declaring that it is in  the employee's best interest to receive a single sum distribution.  Whether the availability of such optional form of benefit discriminates  depends on whether it meets the requirements of Q&A-2; of this Sec.  1.401(a)-4. However, each of the specified conditions limiting the  availability of the optional form of benefit may reasonably be expected  to discriminate in favor of the highly compensated group in operation  because of the likelihood of a significant positive correlation between  the ability to meet any of the specified conditions and membership in  the highly compensated group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A plan limits the availability of a single sum  distribution option to employees employed in one particular division of  the employer's company. All the employees of the company are  participants in the plan. During the 1988 plan year, the division  employs individuals who represent a nondiscriminatory classification of  that company's employees (under section 410(b)(1)(B) prior to the  effective date of the amendments made to section 410(b) by section  1112(a) of TRA '86) and is unlikely to cease employing such a  nondiscriminatory classification in the future. The availability of a  single sum distribution under this plan does not result in  discrimination during the 1988   plan year and may not reasonably be expected to do so.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transitional alternatives. If the availability of an optional  form of benefit under an existing plan is discriminatory under section  401(a)(4), the plan must be amended either to eliminate the optional  form of benefit or to make the availability of the optional form of  benefit nondiscriminatory. For example, the availability of an optional  form of benefit may be made nondiscriminatory by making such benefit  available to sufficient additional employees who are not in the highly  compensated group or by imposing nondiscriminatory objective criteria on  its availability such that the group of employees to whom the benefit is  available is nondiscriminatory. See Q&A-6; of Sec. 1.411(d)-4 for  requirements with respect to such objective criteria. If, under an  existing plan, the availability of an optional form of benefit may  reasonably be expected to discriminate, the plan may be amended in the  same manner permitted where the availability of an optional form of  benefit is discriminatory. See paragraph (d) of this Q&A-5; for rules  limiting the period during which the availability of optional forms of  benefit may be eliminated or reduced under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Compliance and amendment date provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Operational  compliance requirement. On or before the applicable effective date for  the plan (see Q&A-6; of this section), the plan sponsor must select one  of the alternatives permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q&A-5; with  respect to each affected optional form of benefit and the plan must be  operated in accordance with this selection. This is an operational  requirement and does not require a plan amendment prior to the period  set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this Q&A-5.; There is no special  reporting requirement under the Code or this section with respect to  this selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> must be  made with respect to each optional form of benefit for which such  amendment is required and must be retroactive to the applicable  effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(6)</em> provided in this Q&A-; 5.

The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The X Corporation Defined Contribution Plan was  established in 1960. As in effect on January 1, 1974, the plan provided  that, upon the participant's retirement, the participant may elect to  receive the balance of his account in the form of (1) a single-sum cash  payment, (2) a single-sum distribution consisting of X Corporation  stock, (3) five equal annual cash payments, (4) a life annuity, or (5) a  combination of options (1) through (4). The plan also provided that, if  a participant did not elect another form of distribution, the balance of  his account would be distributed to him in the form of a single-sum cash  payment upon his retirement. Assume that section 401(a)(11) and this  section became applicable to the plan as of its plan year beginning  January 1, 1976, with respect to persons who were active participants in  the plan as of such date (see paragraph (f) of this section). If X  Corporation Defined Contribution Plan continues to allow the life  annuity payment option after December 31, 1975, it must be amended to  provide that if a participant elects a life annuity option the life  annuity benefit will be paid in a form having the effect of a qualified  joint and survivor annuity, except to the extent that the participant  elects another form of benefit payment. However, the plan can continue  to   provide that, if no election is made, the balance will be paid as a  single-sum cash payment. If the trust is not so amended, it will fail to  qualify under section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The Corporation Retirement Plan provides that plan  benefits are payable only in the form of a life annuity and also  provides that a participant may retire before the normal retirement age  of 65 and receive a benefit if he has completed 30 years of service.  Under this plan, an employee who begins employment at the age of 18 will  be eligible to receive retirement benefits at the age of 48 if he then  has 30 years of service. This plan must allow a participant to elect in  the time and manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section an  early survivor annuity (defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to  be payable on the death of the participant if death occurs while the  participant is in active service for the employer maintaining the plan  and on or after the date the participant reaches the qualified early  retirement age of 55 (the later of the date the participant reaches the  earliest retirement age (age 48) or 10 years before normal retirement  age (age 55)) but before the day after the day the participant reaches  normal retirement age (age 65).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2. A, B, and C began  employment with Y Corporation when they each attained age 18. A retires  and begins to receive benefit payments at age 48 after completing 30  years of service. The plan is not required to pay a qualified joint and  survivor annuity to A and his spouse at any time. B does not elect an  early survivor annuity at age 55, but retires at age 57 after completing  39 years of service. Unless B makes an election under subparagraph  (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the plan is required to pay a qualified joint  and survivor annuity to B and his spouse. C makes no elections described  in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and dies while in active service  at age 66 after completing 48 years of service. The plan is required to  pay a qualified survivor annuity to C's spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Life annuity. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The  term ``life annuity'' means an annuity that provides retirement payments  and requires the survival of the participant or his spouse as one of the  conditions for any payment or possible payment under the annuity. For  example, annuities that make payments for 10 years or until death,  whichever occurs first or whichever occurs last, are life annuities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> However, the term ``life annuity'' does not include an annuity,  or that portion of an annuity, that provides those benefits which, under  section 411(a)(9), would not be taken into account in the determination  of the normal retirement benefit or early retirement benefit. For  example, ``social security supplements'' described in the fourth  sentence of section 411(a)(9) are not considered to be life annuities  for the purposes of this section, whether or not an early retirement  benefit is provided under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified joint and survivor annuity. The term ``qualified joint  and survivor annuity'' means an annuity for the life of the participant  with a survivor annuity for the life of his spouse which is neither (i)  less than one-half of, nor (ii) greater than, the amount of the annuity  payable during the joint lives of the participant and his spouse. For  purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts described in Sec. 1.401(a)- 11(b)(1)(ii) may be disregarded. A qualified joint and survivor annuity  must be at least the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of life  annuity or, if greater, of any optional form of life annuity offered  under the plan. Equivalence may be determined, on the basis of  consistently applied reasonable actuarial factors, for each participant  or for all participants or reasonable groupings of participants, if such  determination does not result in discrimination in favor of employees  who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated. An annuity is not  a qualified joint and survivor annuity if payments to the spouse of a  deceased participant are terminated, or reduced, because of such  spouse's remarriage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Early survivor annuity. The term ``early survivor annuity''  means an annuity for the life of the participant's spouse the payments  under which must not be less than the payments which would have been  made to the spouse under the joint and survivor annuity if the  participant had made the election described in paragraph (c)(2) of this  section immediately prior to his retirement and if his retirement had  occurred on the day before his death and within the period during which  an election can be made under such paragraph (c)(2). For example, if a  participant would be entitled to a single life annuity of $100 per month  or a reduced amount under a qualified joint and survivor annuity of $80  per month, his   spouse is entitled to a payment of at least $40 per month. However, the  payments may be reduced to reflect the number of months of coverage  under the survivor annuity pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualified early retirement age. The term ``qualified early  retirement age'' means the latest of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The earliest date, under the plan, on which the participant  could elect (without regard to any requirement that approval of early  retirement be obtained) to receive retirement benefits (other than  disability benefits).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The first day of the 120th month beginning before the  participant reaches normal retirement age, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date on which the participant begins participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Normal retirement age. The term ``normal retirement age'' has  the meaning set forth in section 411(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Annuity starting date. The term ``annuity starting date'' means  the first day of the first period with respect to which an amount is  received as a life annuity, whether by reason of retirement or by reason  of disability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Day. The term ``day'' means a calendar day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Elections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Election not to take joint and survivor annuity  form--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A plan shall not be treated as satisfying the  requirements of this section unless it provides that each participant  may elect, during the election period described in subdivision (ii) of  this subparagraph, not to receive a qualified joint and survivor  annuity. However, if a plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor  annuity is the only form of benefit payable under the plan with respect  to a married participant, no election need be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The election shall be in writing and clearly indicate that the  participant is electing to receive all or, if permitted by the plan,  part of his benefits under the plan in a form other than that of a  qualified joint and survivor annuity. A plan will not fail to meet the  requirements of this section merely because the plan requires the  participant to obtain the written approval of his spouse in order for  the participant to make this election or if the plan provides that such  approval is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of the election described in  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the plan shall provide an election  period which shall include a period of at least 90 days following the  furnishing of all of the applicable information required by subparagraph  (3)(i) of this paragraph and ending prior to commencement of benefits.  In no event may the election period end earlier than the 90th day before  the commencement of benefits. Thus, for example, the commencement of  benefits may be delayed until the end of such election period because  the amount of payments to be made to a participant cannot be ascertained  before the end of such period; see Sec. 1.401(a)-14(d).  If a participant makes a request for additional information as provided  in subparagraph (3)(iii) of this paragraph on or before the last day of  the election period, the election period shall be extended to the extent  necessary to include at least the 90 calendar days immediately following  the day the requested additional information is personally delivered or  mailed to the participant. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding  sentence, a plan may provide in cases in which the participant has been  furnished by mail or personal delivery all of the applicable information  required by subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph, that a request for  such additional information must be made on or before a date which is  not less than 60 days from the date of such mailing or delivery; and if  the plan does so provide, the election period shall be extended to the  extent necessary to include at least the 60 calendar days following the  day the requested additional information is personally delivered or  mailed to the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a participant in a plan to which this  subparagraph applies who separated from service after section 401(a)(11)  and this section became applicable to such plan with respect to such  participant, and to whom an election required by this subparagraph has  not been previously made available (and will not become available in  normal course), the plan must provide an election to receive the balance  of his benefits (properly adjusted,   if applicable, for payments received, prior to the exercise of such  election, in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity) in a  form other than that of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. The  provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) shall apply except that in no  event shall the election period end before the 90th day after the date  on which notice of the availability of such election and the applicable  information required by subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph is given  directly to the participant.

Breaks in service  after the participant has attained the qualified early retirement age  neither invalidate a previous election or revocation nor prevent an  election from being made or revoked during the election period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The election shall be in writing and clearly indicate that the  participant is electing the early survivor annuity form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A plan is not required to provide an election under this  subparagraph if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan provides that an early survivor annuity is the only  form of benefit payable under the plan with respect to a married  participant who dies while employed by an employer maintaining the plan,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a defined contribution plan, the plan provides a  survivor benefit at least equal in value to the vested portion of the  participant's account balance, if the participant dies while in active  service with an employer maintaining the plan, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan provides a  survivor benefit at least equal in value to the present value of the  vested portion of the participant's normal form of the accrued benefit  payable at normal retirement age (determined immediately prior to  death), if the participant dies while in active service with an employer  maintaining the plan. Any present values must be determined in  accordance with either the actuarial assumptions or factors specified in  the plan, or a variable standard independent of employer discretion for  converting optional benefits specified in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of the election described in  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section the plan shall provide an election  period which, except as provided in the following sentence, shall begin  not later than the later of either the 90th day before a participant  attains the qualified early retirement age or the date on which his  participation begins, and shall end on the date the participant  terminates his employment. If such a plan contains a provision that any  election made under this subparagraph does not become effective or  ceases to be effective if the participant dies within a certain period  beginning on the date of such election, the election period prescribed  in this subdivision (ii) shall begin not later than the later of (1) a  date which is 90 days plus such certain period before the participant  attains the qualified early retirement age or (2) the date on which his  participation begins. For example, if a plan provides that an election  made under this subparagraph does not become effective if the  participant dies less than 2 years after the date of such election, the  period for making an election under this subparagraph must begin not  later than the later of (1) 2 years and 90 days before the participant  attains the qualified early retirement age, or (2) the date on which his  participation begins. However, the election period for an individual who  was an active participant on the date this section became effective with  regard to the plan need not begin earlier than such effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a participant in a plan to which this  subparagraph applies who dies after section 401(a)(11) and this section  became applicable to such plan with respect to such participant and to  whom an election required   by this subparagraph has not been previously made available, the plan  must give the participant's surviving spouse or, if dead, such spouse's  personal representative the option of electing an early survivor  annuity. The plan may reduce the surviving spouse's annuity to take into  account any benefits already received. The period for making such  election shall not end before the 90th day after the date on which  written notice of the availability of such election and applicable  information required by subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph is given  directly to such surviving spouse or personal representative.

A plan will not fail to meet the  requirements of section 401(a)(11) and this section merely because it  provides that the spouse of a deceased participant may elect to have  benefits paid in a form other than a survivor annuity. If the plan  provides that such a spouse may make such an election, the plan  administrator must furnish to this spouse, within a reasonable amount of  time after a written request has been made by this spouse, a written  explanation in non-technical language of the survivor annuity and any  other form of payment which may be selected. This explanation must state  the financial effect (in terms of dollars) of each form of payment. A  plan need not respond to more than one such request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Permissible additional plan provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A plan  will not fail to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) and this  section merely because it contains one or more of the provisions  described in paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claim for benefits. A plan may provide that as a condition  precedent to the payment of benefits, a participant must express in  writing to the plan administrator the form in which he prefers benefits  to be paid and provide all the information reasonably necessary for the  payment of such benefits. However, if a participant files a claim for  benefits with the plan administrator and provides the plan administrator  with all the information necessary for the payment of benefits but does  not indicate a preference as to the form for the payment of benefits,  benefits must be paid in the form of a qualified joint and survivor  annuity if the participant has attained the qualified early retirement  age unless such participant has made an effective election not to  receive benefits in such form. For rules relating to provisions in a  plan to the effect that a claim for benefits must be filed before the  payment of benefits will commence, see Sec. 1.401(a)-14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Marriage requirements. A plan may provide that a joint and  survivor annuity will be paid only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The participant and his spouse have been married to each other  throughout a period (not exceeding one year) ending on the annuity  starting date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The spouse of the participant is not entitled to receive a  survivor annuity (whether or not the election described in paragraph  (c)(2) of this section has been made) unless the participant and his  spouse have been married to each other throughout a period (not  exceeding one year) ending on the date of such participant's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The same spouse must satisfy the requirements of subdivisions  (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The participant must notify the plan administrator (as defined  by section 414(g)) of his marital status within any reasonable time  period specified in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of participant's death on an election or revocation of an  election under paragraph (c). A plan may provide that any election  described in paragraph (c) of this section or any revocation of any such  election does not become effective   or ceases to be effective if the participant dies within a period, not  in excess of 2 years, beginning on the date of such election or  revocation. However, a plan containing a provision described in the  preceding sentence shall not satisfy the requirements of this section  unless it also provides that any such election or any revocation of any  such election will be given effect in any case in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The participant dies from accidental causes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A failure to give effect to the election or revocation would  deprive the participant's survivor of a survivor annuity, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Such election or revocation is made before such accident  occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Benefit option approval by third party. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan may provide  that an optional form of benefit elected by a participant is subject to  the approval of an administrative committee or similar third party.  However, the administrative committee cannot deny a participant any of  the benefits required by section 401(a)(11). For example, if a plan  offers a life annuity option, the committee may deny the participant a  qualified joint and survivor annuity only by denying the participant  access to all life annuity options without knowledge of whether the  participant wishes to receive a qualified joint and survivor annuity.  Alternatively, if the committee knows which form of life annuity the  participant has chosen before the committee makes its decision, the  committee cannot withhold its consent for payment of a qualified joint  and survivor annuity event though it denies all other life annuity  options. This subparagraph (5) only applies before the effective date of  the amendment made to section 411(d)(6) by section 301 of the Retirement  Equity Act of 1984. See section 411(d)(6) and the regulations thereunder  for rules limiting employer discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1980 plan M provides that the automatic form of benefit  is a single sum distribution. The plan also permits, subject to approval  by the administrative committee, the election of several optional forms  of life annuity. On the election form that is reviewed by the  administrative committee the participant indicates whether any life  annuity option is preferred, without indicating the particular life  annuity chosen. Thus, the committee approves or disapproves the election  without knowledge of whether a qualified joint and survivor annuity will  be elected. The administrative committee approval provision in Plan M  does not cause the plan to fail to satisfy this section. On the other  hand, if the form indicates which form of life annuity is preferred,  committee disapproval of any election of the qualified joint and  survivor annuity would cause the plan to fail to satisfy this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Costs of providing qualified joint and survivor annuity form or  early survivor annuity form. A plan may take into account in any  equitable manner consistent with generally accepted actuarial principles  applied on a consistent basis any increased costs resulting from  providing qualified joint and survivor annuity and early survivor  annuity benefits. A plan may give a participant the option of paying  premiums only if it provides another option under which an out-of-pocket  expense by the participant is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Application and effective date. Section 401(a)(11) and this  section shall apply to a plan only with respect to plan years beginning  after December 31, 1975, and shall apply only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The participant's annuity starting date did not fall within a  plan year beginning before January 1, 1976, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The participant was an active participant in the plan on or  after the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31,  1975.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``active participant''  means a participant for whom benefits are being accrued under the plan  on his behalf (in the case of a defined benefit plan), the employer is  obligated to contribute to or under the plan on his behalf (in the case  of a defined contribution plan other than a profit-sharing plan), or the  employer either is obligated to contribute to or under the plan on his  behalf or would have been obligated to contribute to or under the plan  on his behalf if any contribution were made to or under the plan (in the  case of a profit-sharing plan).  If benefits under a plan are provided by the distribution to the  participants of   individual annuity contracts, the annuity starting date will be  considered for purposes of this paragraph to fall within a plan year  beginning before January 1, 1976, with respect to any such individual  contract that was distributed to the participant during a plan year  beginning before January 1, 1976, if no premiums are paid with respect  to such contract during a plan year beginning after December 31, 1975.  In the case of individual annuity contracts that are distributed to  participants before January 1, 1978, and which contain an option to  provide a qualified joint and survivor annuity, the requirements of this  section will be considered to have been satisfied if, not later than  January 1, 1978, holders of individual annuity contracts who are  participants described in the first sentence of this paragraph are given  an opportunity to have such contracts amended, so as to provide for a  qualified joint and survivor annuity in the absence of a contrary  election, within a period of not less than one year from the date such  opportunity was offered. In no event, however, shall the preceding  sentence apply with respect to benefits attributable to premiums paid  after December 31, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effect of REA 1984--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The term ``qualified domestic relations order'' (QDRO) has  the meaning set forth in section 414(p). For purposes of the Internal  Revenue Code, a QDRO also includes any domestic relations order  described in section 303(d) of the Retirement Equity Act of 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan amendments. A plan will not fail to satisfy the  qualification requirements of section 401(a) or 403(a) merely because it  does not include provisions with regard to a QDRO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waiver of distribution requirements. A plan shall not be treated  as failing to satisfy the requirements of sections 401 (a) and (k) and  409(d) solely because of a payment to an alternate payee pursuant to a  QDRO. This is the case even if the plan provides for payments pursuant  to a QDRO to an alternate payee prior to the time it may make payments  to a participant. Thus, for example, a pension plan may pay an alternate  payee even though the participant may not receive a distribution because  he continues to be employed by the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination with section 417--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Former spouse. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. Under section 414(p)(5), a QDRO may provide that a former  spouse shall be treated as the current spouse of a participant for all  or some purposes under sections 401(a)(11) and 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Consent. (1) To the extent a former spouse is treated as the  current spouse of the participant by reason of a QDRO, any current  spouse shall not be treated as the current spouse. For example, assume H  is divorced from W, but a QDRO provides that H shall be treated as W's  current spouse with respect to all of W's benefits under a plan. H will  be treated as the surviving spouse under the QPSA and QJSA unless W  obtains H's consent to waive the QPSA or QJSA or both. The fact that W  married S after W's divorce from H is disregarded. If, however, the QDRO  had provided that H shall be treated as W's current spouse only with  respect to benefits that accrued prior to the divorce, then H's consent  would be needed by W to waive the QPSA or QJSA with respect to benefits  accrued before the divorce. S's consent would be required with respect  to the remainder of the benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the preceding examples, if the QDRO ordered that a portion of  W's benefit (either through separate accounts or a percentage of the  benefit) must be distributed to H rather than ordering that H be treated  as W's spouse, the survivor annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11)  and 417 would not apply to the part of W's benefit awarded H. Instead,  the terms of the QDRO would determine how H's portion of W's accrued  benefit is paid. W is required to obtain S's consent if W elects to  waive either the QJSA or QPSA with respect to the remaining portion of  W's benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amount of the QPSA or QJSA. (1) Where, because of a QDRO, more  than one individual is to be treated as the surviving spouse, a plan may  provide that the total amount to be paid in the form of a QPSA or  survivor portion of a QJSA may not exceed the amount that would be paid  if there were only one surviving spouse.

Rights and benefits under section 401(a)(11) or 417 may  not be eliminated or reduced because the plan uses annuity contracts to  provide benefits merely because (a) such a contract is held by a  participant or spouse instead of a plan trustee, or (b) such contracts  are distributed upon plan termination.

For this purpose,  availability within the 90-day period following the date of death is  deemed to be reasonable and the reasonableness of longer periods shall  be determined based on the particular facts and circumstances. A time  period longer than 90 days, however, is deemed unreasonable if it is  less favorable to the surviving spouse than any time period under the  plan that is applicable to other distributions. Thus, for example, the  availability of a benefit to the surviving spouse would be unreasonable  if the distribution was required to be made by the close of the plan  year including the participant's death while distributions to employees  who separate from service were required to be made within 90 days of  separation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The benefit payable to the surviving spouse is adjusted for  gains or   losses occurring after the participant's death in accordance with plan  rules governing the adjustment of account balances for other plan  distributions. Thus, for example, the plan may not provide for  distributions of an account balance to a surviving spouse determined as  of the last day of the quarter in which the participant's death occurred  with no adjustments of an account balance for gains or losses after  death if the plan provides for such adjustments for a participant who  separates from service within a quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of determining the extent to which section  401(a)(11) applies to benefits under an employee stock ownership plan  (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)), the portion of a participant's  accrued benefit that is subject to section 409(h) is to be treated as  though such benefit were provided under a defined contribution plan not  subject to section 412.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The requirements set forth in section 401(a)(11) apply to other  employee benefit plans that are covered by applicable provisions under  title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

For example, to the extent that section 205 covers  section 403(b) contracts and custodial accounts they are treated as  section 401(a) plans. Individual retirement plans (IRAs), including IRAs  to which contributions are made under simplified employee pensions  described in section 408(k) and IRAs that are treated as plans subject  to title I, are not subject to these requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: What rules apply to a participant who elects a life annuity  option under a defined contribution plan not subject to section 412?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: If a participant elects at any time (irrespective of the  applicable election period defined in section 417(a)(6)) a life annuity  option under a defined contribution plan not subject to section 412, the  survivor annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 will always  thereafter apply to all of the participant's benefits under such plan  unless there is a separate accounting of the account balance subject to  the election. A plan may allow a participant to elect an annuity option  prior to the applicable election period described in section 417(a)(6).  If a participant elects an annuity option, the plan must satisfy the  applicable written explanation, consent, election, and withdrawal rules  of section 417, including waiver of the QJSA within 90 days of the  annuity starting date. If a participant selecting such an option dies,  the surviving spouse must be able to receive the QPSA benefit described  in section 417(c)(2) which is a life annuity, the actuarial equivalent  of which is not less than 50 percent of the nonforfeitable account  balance (adjusted for loans as described in Q&A; 24(d) of this section).  The remaining account balance may be paid to a designated nonspouse  beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: How do sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply to transferee plans  which are defined contribution plans not subject to section 412?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: (a) Transferee plans. Although the survivor annuity  requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 generally do not apply to  defined contribution plans not subject to section 412, such plans are  subject to the survivor annuity requirements to the extent that they are  transferee plans with respect to any participant. A defined contribution  plan is a transferee plan with respect to any participant if the plan is  a direct or indirect transferee of such participant's benefits held on  or after January 1, 1985, by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A defined benefit plan,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A defined contribution plan subject to section 412 or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A defined contribution plan that is subject to the survivor  annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 with respect to that  participant.  If through a merger, spinoff, or other transaction having the effect of  a transfer, benefits subject to the survivor annuity requirements of  sections 401(a)(11) and 417 are held under a plan that is not otherwise  subject to such requirements, such benefits will be subject to the  survivor annuity requirements even though they are held under such plan.  Even if a plan satisfies the survivor annuity requirements, other rules  apply to these transactions. See,   e.g., section 411(d)(6) and the regulations thereunder. A transfer made  before January 1, 1985, and any rollover contribution made at any time,  are not transactions that subject the transferee plan to the survivor  annuity requirements with respect to a participant. If a plan is a  transferee plan with respect to a participant, the survivor annuity  requirements do not apply with respect to other plan participants solely  because of the transfer. Any plan that would not otherwise be subject to  the survivor annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 whose  benefits are used to offset benefits in a plan subject to such  requirements is subject to the survivor annuity requirements with  respect to those participants whose benefits are offset. Thus, if a  stock bonus or profit-sharing plan offsets benefits under a defined  benefit plan, such a plan is subject to the survivor annuity  requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Benefits covered. The survivor annuity requirements apply to all  accrued benefits held for a participant with respect to whom the plan is  a transferee plan unless there is an acceptable separate accounting  between the transferred benefits and all other benefits under the plan.  A separate accounting is not acceptable unless gains, losses,  withdrawals, contributions, forfeitures, and other credits or charges  are allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis between the accrued  benefits subject to the survivor annuity requirements and other  benefits. If there is an acceptable separate accounting between  transferred benefits and any other benefits under the plan, only the  transferred benefits are subject to the survivor annuity requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: Is a frozen or terminated plan required to satisfy the survivor  annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: In general, benefits provided under a plan that is subject to  the survivor annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 must be  provided in accordance with those requirements even if the plan is  frozen or terminated. However, any plan that has a termination date  prior to September 17, 1985, and that distributed all remaining assets  as soon as administratively feasible after the termination date, is not  subject to the survivor annuity requirements.

If a participant survives until the annuity starting date with  vested benefits attributable to employer or employee contributions (or  both), benefits must be provided to the participant in the form of a  QJSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A participant may waive the QPSA or the QJSA (or both) if the  applicable notice, election, and spousal consent requirements of section  417 are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Benefits are not required to be paid in the form of a QPSA or  QJSA if at the time of death or distribution the participant was vested  only in employee contributions and such death occurred, or distribution  commenced, before October 22, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certain mandatory distributions. A distribution may occur  without satisfying the spousal consent requirements of section 417 (a)  and (e) if the present value of the nonforfeitable benefit does not  exceed the cash-out limit in effect underSec. 1.411(a)-11(c)(3)(ii).  See Sec. 1.417(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: May separate portions of a participant's accrued benefit be  subject to QPSA and QJSA requirements at any particular point in time?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: (a) Dual QPSA and QJSA rights. One portion of a participant's  benefit may be subject to the QPSA and another portion to the QJSA  requirements at the same time. For example, in order for a money  purchase pension plan to distribute any portion of a married  participant's benefit to the participant, the plan must distribute such   portion in the form of a QJSA (unless the plan satisfies the applicable  consent requirements of section 417 (a) and (e) with respect to such  portion of the participant's benefit). This rule applies even if the  distribution is merely an in-service distribution attributable to  voluntary employee contributions and regardless of whether the  participant has attained the normal retirement age under the plan. The  QJSA requirements apply to such a distribution because the annuity  starting date has occurred with respect to this portion of the  participant's benefit. In the event of a participant's death following  the commencement of a distribution in the form of a QJSA, the remaining  payments must be made to the surviving spouse under the QJSA. In  addition, the plan must satisfy the QPSA requirements with respect to  any portion of the participant's benefits for which the annuity starting  date had not yet occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. Assume that participant A has a $100,000 account  balance in a money purchase pension plan. A makes an in-service  withdrawal of $20,000 attributable to voluntary employee contributions.  The QJSA requirements apply to A's withdrawal of the $20,000.  Accordingly, unless the QJSA form is properly waived such amount must be  distributed in the form of a QJSA. A's remaining account balance  ($80,000) remains subject to the QPSA requirements because the annuity  starting date has not occurred with respect to the $80,000. (If A  survives until the annuity starting date, the $80,000 would be subject  to the QJSA requirements.) If A died on the day following the annuity  starting date for the withdrawal, A's spouse would be entitled to a QPSA  with a value equal to at least $40,000 with respect to the $80,000  account balance, in addition to any survivor benefit without respect to  the $20,000. If the $20,000 payment to A had been the first payment of  an annuity purchased with the entire $100,000 account balance rather  than an in-service distribution, then the QJSA requirements would apply  to the entire account balance at the time of the annuity starting date.  In such event, the plan would have no obligation to provide A's spouse  with a QPSA benefit upon A's death. Of course, A's spouse would receive  the QJSA benefit (if the QJSA had not been waived) based on the full  $100,000.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: What is the relevance of the annuity starting date with  respect to the survivor benefit requirements?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: (a) Relevance. The annuity starting date is relevant to  whether benefits are payable as either a QJSA or QPSA, or other selected  optional form of benefit. If a participant is alive on the annuity  starting date, the benefits must be payable as a QJSA. If the  participant is not alive on the annuity starting date, the surviving  spouse must receive a QPSA. The annuity starting date is also used to  determine when a spouse may consent to and a participant may waive a  QJSA. A waiver is only effective if it is made 90 days before the  annuity starting date. Thus, a deferred annuity cannot be selected and a  QJSA waived until 90 days before payments commence under the deferred  annuity. In some cases, the annuity starting date will have occurred  with respect to a portion of the participant's accrued benefit and will  not have occurred with respect to the remaining portion. (See Q&A-9.;)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Annuity starting date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. For purposes of  sections 401(a)(11), 411(a)(11) and 417, the annuity starting date is  the first day of the first period for which an amount is paid as an  annuity or any other form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annuity payments. The annuity starting date is the first date  for which an amount is paid, not the actual date of payment. Thus, if  participant A is to receive annuity payments as of the first day of the  first month after retirement but does not receive any payments until  three months later, the annuity starting date is the first day of the  first month. For example, if an annuity is to commence on January 1,  January 1 is the annuity starting date even though the payment for  January is not actually made until a later date. In the case of a  deferred annuity, the annuity starting date is the date for which the  annuity payments are to commence, not the date that the deferred annuity  is elected or the date the deferred annuity contract is distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Administrative delay. A payment shall not be considered to occur  after the annuity starting date merely because actual payment is  reasonably delayed for calculation of the benefit amount if all payments  are actually made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Forfeitures on death. Prior to the annuity starting date,  section 411(a)(3)(A) allows a plan to provide for a forfeiture of a  participant's benefit, except in the case of a QPSA or a spousal benefit  described in section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii)(I). Once the annuity starting  date has occurred, even if actual payment has not yet been made, a plan  must pay the benefit in the distribution form elected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Surviving spouses, alternate payees, etc. The definition of  ``annuity starting date'' for surviving spouses, other beneficiaries and  alternate payees under section 414(p) is the same as it is for  participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disability auxiliary benefit--(1) General rule. The annuity  starting date for a disability benefit is the first day of the first  period for which the benefit becomes payable unless the disability  benefit is an auxiliary benefit. The payment of any auxiliary disability  benefits is disregarded in determining the annuity starting date. A  disability benefit is an auxiliary benefit if upon attainment of early  or normal retirement age, a participant receives a benefit that  satisfies the accrual and vesting rules of section 411 without taking  into account the disability benefit payments up to that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume that participant A at age 45 is entitled to a  vested accrued benefit of $100 per month commencing at age 65 in the  form of a joint and survivor annuity under Plan X. If prior to age 65 A  receives a disability benefit under Plan X and the payment of such  benefit does not reduce the amount of A's retirement benefit of $100 per  month commencing at age 65, any disability benefit payments made to A  between ages 45 and 65 are auxiliary benefits. Thus, A's annuity  starting date does not occur until A attains age 65. A's surviving  spouse B would be entitled to receive a QPSA if A died before age 65. B  would be entitled to receive the survivor portion of a QJSA (unless  waived) if A died after age 65. The QPSA payable to B upon A's death  prior to age 65 would be computed by reference to the QJSA that would  have been payable to A and B had A survived to age 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If in the above example A's benefit payable at age 65 is  reduced to $99 per month because a disability benefit is provided to A  prior to age 65, the disability benefit would not be an auxiliary  benefit. The benefit of $99 per month payable to A at age 65 would not,  without taking into account the disability benefit payments to A prior  to age 65, satisfy the minimum vesting and accrual rules of section 411.  Accordingly, the first day of the first period for which the disability  payments are to be made to A would constitute A's annuity starting date,  and any benefit paid to A would be required to be paid in the form of a  QJSA (unless waived by A with the consent of B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Suspension of benefits. If benefit payments are  suspended after the annuity starting date pursuant to a suspension of  benefits described in section 411(a)(3)(B) after an employee separates  from service, the recommencement of benefit payments after the  suspension is not treated as a new annuity starting date unless the plan  provides otherwise. In such case, the plan administrator is not required  to provide new notices nor to obtain new waivers for the recommenced  distributions if the form of distribution is the same as the form that  was appropriately selected prior to the suspension. If benefits are  suspended for an employee who continues in service without a separation  and who never receives payments, the commencement of payments after the  period of suspension is treated as the annuity starting date unless the  plan provides otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional accruals. In the case of an annuity starting date  that occurs on or after normal retirement age, such date applies to any  additional accruals after the annuity starting date, unless the plan  provides otherwise. For example, if a participant who continues to  accrue benefits elects to have benefits paid in an optional form at  normal retirement age, the additional accruals must be paid in the  optional form selected unless the plan provides otherwise. In the case  of an annuity starting date that occurs prior to normal retirement age,  such date does not apply to any additional accruals after such date.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: Do the survivor annuity requirements apply to benefits derived  from both employer and employee contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: Yes. The survivor annuity benefit requirements apply to  benefits derived from both employer and employee contributions. Benefits  are not required to be paid in the form of a QPSA or a QJSA if the  participant was vested only in employee contributions at the time of  death or distribution and such death or distribution occurred before  October 22, 1986. All benefits provided under a plan, including benefits  attributable to rollover contributions, are subject to the survivor  annuity requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: To what benefits do the survivor annuity requirements of  sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: (a) Defined benefit plans. Under a defined benefit plan,  sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply only to benefits in which a  participant was vested immediately prior to death. They do not apply to  benefits to which a participant's beneficiary becomes entitled by reason  of death or to the proceeds of a life insurance contract to the extent  such proceeds exceed the present value of the participant's  nonforfeitable benefits that existed immediately prior to death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Defined contribution plans. Sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply to  all nonforfeitable benefits which are payable under a defined  contribution plan, whether nonforfeitable before or upon death,  including the proceeds of insurance contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: Does the rule of section 411(a)(3)(A) which permits  forfeitures on account of death apply to a QPSA or the spousal benefit  described in section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii)?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: No. Section 411(a)(3)(A) permits forfeiture on account of  death prior to the time all the events fixing payment occur. However,  this provision does not operate to deprive a surviving spouse of a QPSA  or the spousal benefit described in section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii).  Therefore, sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply to benefits that were  nonforfeitable immediately prior to death (determined without regard to  section 411(a)(3)(A)). Thus, in the case of the death of a married  participant in a defined contribution plan not subject to section 412  which provides that, upon a participant's death, the entire  nonforfeitable accrued benefit is payable to the participant's spouse,  the nonforfeitable benefit is determined without regard to the  provisions of section 411(a)(3)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: Do sections 411(a)(11), 401(a)(11) and 417 apply to  accumulated deductible employee contributions, as defined in section  72(o)(5)(B) (Accumulated DECs)?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: (a) Employee consent, section 411. The requirements of section  411(a)(11) apply to Accumulated DECs. Thus, Accumulated DECs may not be  distributed without participant consent unless the applicable exemptions  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Survior requirements. Accumulated DECs are treated as though  held under a separate defined contribution plan that is not subject to  section 412. Thus, section 401(a)(11) applies to Accumulated DECs only  as provided in section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii). All Accumulated DECs are  treated in this manner, including Accumulated DECs that are the only  benefit held under a plan and Accumulated DECs that are part of a  defined benefit or a defined contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. Sections 401(a)(11) and 411(a)(11) shall not  apply to distributions of accumulated DECs until the first plan year  beginning after December 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: How do the survivor annuity requirements of sections  401(a)(11) and 417 apply to a defined benefit plan that includes an  accrued benefit based upon a contribution to a separate account or  mandatory employee contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: (a) 414(k) plans. In the case of a section 414(k) plan that  includes both a defined benefit plan and a separate account, the rules  of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply separately to the defined benefit  portion and the separate account portion of the plan. The separate  account portion is subject to the survivor annuity requirements of  sections 401(a)(11) and 417 and the special QPSA rules in section  417(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employee contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Voluntary. In the case of voluntary  employee contributions to a defined benefit plan, the plan must maintain  a separate account with respect to the voluntary employee contributions.  This separate account is subject to the   survivor annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 and the  special QPSA rules in section 417(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mandatory. In the case of a defined benefit plan providing for  mandatory employee contributions, the entire accrued benefit is subject  to the survivor annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 as a  defined benefit plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Accumulated DECs. See Q&A; 14 of this section for the rule  applicable to accumulated deductible employee contributions.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: Can a plan provide a benefit form more valuable than the QJSA  and if a plan offers more than one annuity option satisfying the  requirements of a QJSA, is spousal consent required when the participant  chooses among the various forms?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: In the case of an unmarried participant, the QJSA may be less  valuable than other optional forms of benefit payable under the plan. In  the case of a married participant, the QJSA must be at least as valuable  as any other optional form of benefit payable under the plan at the same  time. Thus, if a plan has two joint and survivor annuities that would  satisfy the requirements for a QJSA, but one has a greater actuarial  value than the other, the more valuable joint and survivor annuity is  the QJSA. If there are two or more actuarially equivalent joint and  survivor annuities that satisfy the requirements for a QJSA, the plan  must designate which one is the QJSA and, therefore, the automatic form  of benefit payment. A plan, however, may allow a participant to elect  out of such a QJSA, without spousal consent, in favor of another  actuarially equivalent joint and survivor annuity that satisfies the  QJSA conditions. Such an election is not subject to the requirement that  it be made within the 90-day period before the annuity starting date.  For example, if a plan designates a joint and 100% survivor annuity as  the QJSA and also offers an actuarially equivalent joint and 50%  survivor annuity that would satisfy the requirements of a QJSA, the  participant may elect the joint and 50% survivor annuity without spousal  consent. The participant, however, does need spousal consent to elect a  joint and survivor annuity that was not actuarially equivalent to the  automatic QJSA. A plan does not fail to satisfy the requirements of this  Q&A-16; merely because the amount payable under an optional form of  benefit that is subject to the minimum present value requirement of  section 417(e)(3) is calculated using the applicable interest rate (and,  for periods when required, the applicable mortality table) under section  417(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Q-17: When must distributions to a participant under a QJSA  commence?</p><p class="depth0">A-17: (a) QJSA benefits upon earliest retirement. A plan must permit  a participant to receive a distribution in the form of a QJSA when the  participant attains the earliest retirement age under the plan. Written  consent of the participant is required. However, the consent of the  participant's spouse is not required. Any payment not in the form of a  QJSA is subject to spousal consent. For example, if the participant  separates from service under a plan that allows for distributions on  separation from service or if a plan allows for in-service  distributions, the participant may receive a QJSA without spousal  consent in such events. Payments in any other form, including a single  sum, would require waiver of the QJSA by the participant's spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Earliest retirement age. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (b) defines the term  ``earliest retirement age'' for purposes of sections 401(a)(11),  411(a)(11) and 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a plan that provides for voluntary distributions  that commence upon the participant's separation from service, earliest  retirement age is the earliest age at which a participant could separate  from service and receive a distribution. Death of a participant is  treated as a separation from service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a plan that provides for in-service  distributions, earliest retirement age is the earliest age at which such  distributions may be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the case of a plan not described in subparagraph (2) or (3)  of this paragraph, the rule below applies. Earliest retirement age is  the early retirement age determined under the plan, or if no early  retirement age, the normal retirement age determined under the   plan. If the participant dies or separates from service before such age,  then only the participant's actual years of service at the time of the  participant's separation from service or death are taken into account.  Thus, in the case of a plan under which benefits are not payable until  the attainment of age 65, or upon attainment of age 55 and completion of  10 years of service, the earliest retirement age of a participant who  died or separated from service with 8 years of service is when the  participant would have attained age 65 (if the participant had  survived). On the other hand, if a participant died or separated from  service after 10 years of service, the earliest retirement age is when  the participant would have attained age 55 (if the participant had  survived).</p><p class="depth0">Q-18: What is a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA) in a  defined benefit plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-18: A QPSA is an immediate annuity for the life of the surviving  spouse of a participant. Each payment under a QPSA under a defined  benefit plan is not to be less than the payment that would have been  made to the survivor under the QJSA payable under the plan if (a) in the  case of a participant who dies after attaining the earliest retirement  age under the plan, the participant had retired with a QJSA on the day  before the participant's death, and (b) in the case of a participant who  dies on or before the participant's earliest retirement age under the  plan, the participant had separated from service at the earlier of the  actual time of separation or death, survived until the earliest  retirement age, retired at that time with a QJSA, and died on the day  thereafter. If the participant elects before the annuity starting date a  form of joint and survivor annuity that satisfies the requirements for a  QJSA and dies before the annuity starting date, the elected form is  treated as the QJSA and the QPSA must be based on such form.</p><p class="depth0">Q-19: What rules apply in determining the amount and forfeitability  of a QPSA?</p><p class="depth0">A-19: The QPSA is calculated as of the earliest retirement age if  the participant dies before such time, or at death if the participant  dies after the earliest retirement age. The plan must make reasonable  actuarial adjustments to reflect a payment earlier or later than the  earliest retirement age. A defined benefit plan may provide that the  QPSA is forfeited if the spouse does not survive until the date  prescribed under the plan for commencement of the QPSA (i.e., the  earliest retirement age). Similarly, if the spouse survives past the  participant's earliest retirement age (or other earlier QPSA  distribution date under the plan) and elects after the death of the  participant to defer the commencement of the QPSA to a later date, a  defined benefit plan may provide for a forfeiture of the QPSA benefit if  the spouse does not survive until the deferred commencement date. The  account balance in a defined contribution plan may not be forfeited even  though the spouse does not survive until the time the account balance is  used to purchase the QPSA. See Q&A-17; of this section for the meaning of  earliest retirement age.</p><p class="depth0">Q-20: What preretirement survivor annuity benefits must a defined  contibution plan subject to the survivor annuity requirements of  sections 401(a)(11) and 417 provide?</p><p class="depth0">A-20: A defined contribution plan that is subject to the survivor  annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 must provide a  preretirement survivor annuity with a value which is not less than 50  percent of the nonforfeitable account balance of the participant as of  the date of the participant's death. If a contributory defined  contribution plan has a forfeiture provision permitted by section  411(a)(3)(A), not more than a proportional percent of the account  balance attributable to contributions that may not be forfeited at death  (for example, employee and section 401(k) contributions) may be used to  satisfy the QPSA benefit. Thus, for example, if the QPSA benefit is to  be provided from 50 percent of the account balance, not more than 50  percent of the nonforfeitable contributions may be used for the QPSA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-21: May a defined benefit plan charge the participant for the cost  of the QPSA benefit?</p><p class="depth0">A-21: Prior to the later of the time the plan allows the participant  to waive the QPSA or provides notice of   the ability to waive the QPSA, a defined benefit plan may not charge the  participant for the cost of the QPSA by reducing the participant's plan  benefits or by any other method. The preceding sentence does not apply  to any charges prior to the first plan year beginning after December 31,  1988. Once the participant is given the opportunity to waive the QPSA or  the notice of the QPSA is later, the plan may charge the participant for  the cost of the QPSA. A charge for the QPSA that reasonably reflects the  cost of providing the QPSA will not fail to satisfy section 411 even if  it reduces the accrued benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Q-22: When must distributions to a surviving spouse under a QPSA  commence?</p><p class="depth0">A-22: (a) In the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan must  permit the surviving spouse to direct the commencement of payments under  QPSA no later than the month in which the participant would have  attained the earliest retirement age. However, a plan may permit the  commencement of payments at an earlier date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a defined contribution plan, the plan must permit  the surviving spouse to direct the commencement of payments under the  QPSA within a reasonable time after the participant's death.</p><p class="depth0">Q-23: Must a defined benefit plan obtain the consent of a  participant and the participant's spouse to commence payments in the  form of a QJSA in order to avoid violating section 415 or 411(b)?</p><p class="depth0">A-23: No. A defined benefit plan may commence distributions in the  form of a QJSA without the consent of the participant and spouse, even  if consent would otherwise be required (see Sec. 1.417(e)-1(b)), to the  extent necessary to avoid a violation of section 415 or 411(b). For  example, assume a plan has a normal retirement age of 55. A is a married  participant, age 55, and has accrued a $75,000 joint and 100 percent  survivor annuity that satisfies section 415. If an actuarial increase  would be required under section 411 because of deferred commencement and  the increase would cause the benefit to exceed the applicable limit  under section 415, the plan may commence payment of a QJSA at age 55  without the participant's election or consent and without the spouse's  concent.</p><p class="depth0">Q-24: What are the rules under sections 401(a)(11) and 417  applicable to plan loans?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A plan does not satisfy the survivor  annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 unless the plan  provides that, at the time the participant's accrued benefit is used as  security for a loan, spousal consent to such use is obtained. Consent is  required even if the accrued benefit is not the primary security for the  loan. No spousal consent is necessary if, at the time the loan is  secured, no consent would be required for a distribution under section  417(a)(2)(B). Spousal consent is not required if the plan or the  participant is not subject to section 401(a)(11) at the time the accrued  benefit is used as security, or if the total accrued benefit subject to  the security is not in excess of the cash-out limit in effect under  Sec. 1.411(a)-11(c)(3)(ii). The spousal consent must be obtained no  earlier than the beginning of the 90-day period that ends on the date on  which the loan is to be so secured. The consent is subject to the  requirements of section 417(a)(2). Therefore, the consent must be in  writing, must acknowledge the effect of the loan and must be witnessed  by a plan representative or a notary public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Participant consent is deemed obtained at the time the  participant agrees to use his accrued benefit as security for a loan for  purposes of satisfying the requirements for participant consent under  sections 401(a)(11), 411(a)(11) and 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Change in status. If spousal consent is obtained or is not  required under paragraph (a) of this Q&A; 24 at the time the benefits are  used as security, spousal consent is not required at the time of any  setoff of the loan against the accrued benefit resulting from a default,  even if the participant is married to a different spouse at the time of  the setoff. Similarly, in the case of a participant who secured a loan  while unmarried, no consent is required at the time of a setoff of the  loan against the accrued benefit even if the participant is married at  the time of the setoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Renegotiation. For purposes of obtaining any required spousal  consent, any renegotiation, extension, renewal, or other revision of a  loan shall be treated as a new loan made on the date of the  renegotiation, extension, renewal, or other revision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect on benefits. For purposes of determining the amount of a  QPSA or QJSA, the accrued benefit of a participant shall be reduced by  any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding  to the participant at the time of death or payment, if the security  interest is treated as payment in satisfaction of the loan under the  plan. A plan may offset any loan outstanding at the participant's death  which is secured by the participant's account balance against the  spousal benefit required to be paid under section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date.

Plans subject to the survivor  annuity requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417 must satisfy those  requirements applicable to QJSAs with respect to participants who are  not married. A QJSA for a participant who is not married is an annuity  for the life of the participant. Thus, an unmarried participant must be  provided the written explanation described in section 417(a)(3)(A) and a  single life annuity unless another form of benefit is elected by the  participant. An unmarried participant is deemed to have waived the QPSA  requirements. This deemed waiver is null and void if the participant  later marries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Marital status change--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Remarriage. If a participant is  married on the date of death, payments to a surviving spouse under a  QPSA or QJSA must continue even if the surviving spouse remarries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One-year rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan is not required to treat a participant  as married unless the participant and the participant's spouse have been  married throughout the one-year period ending on the earlier of (A) the  participant's annuity starting date or (B) the date of the participant's  death. Nevertheless, for purposes of the preceding sentence, a  participant and the participant's spouse must be treated as married  throughout the one-year period ending on the participant's annuity  starting date even though they are married to each other for less than  one year before the annuity starting date if they remain married to each  other for at least one year. See section 417(d)(2). If a plan adopts the  one-year rule provided in section 417(d), the plan must treat the  participant and spouse who are married on the annuity starting date as  married and must provide benefits which are to commence on the annuity  starting date in the form of a QJSA unless the participant (with spousal  consent) elects another form of benefit. The plan is not required to  provide the participant with a new or retroactive election or the spouse  with a new consent when the one-year period is satisfied. If the  participant and the spouse do not remain married for at least one year,  the plan may treat the participant as having not been married on the  annuity starting date. In such event, the plan may provide that the  spouse loses any survivor benefit right; further, no retroactive  correction of the amount paid the participant is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. Plan X provides that participants who are married on  the annuity starting date for less than one year are treated as  unmarried participants. Plan X provides benefits in the form of a QJSA  or an optional single sum distribution. Participant A was married 6  months prior to the annuity starting date. Plan X must treat A as  married and must commence payments to A in the form of a QJSA unless  another form of benefit is elected by A with spousal consent. If a QJSA  is paid and A is divorced from his spouse S, within the first year of  the marriage, S will no longer have any survivor rights under the  annuity (unless a QDRO provides otherwise). If A continues to be married  to S, and A dies within the one-year period, Plan X may treat A as  unmarried and forfeit the OJSA benefit payable to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Divorce. If a participant divorces his spouse prior to the  annuity starting date, any elections made while the participant was  married to his former spouse remain valid, unless otherwise provided in  a QDRO, or unless the participant changes them or is remarried. If a  participant dies after the annuity starting date, the spouse to whom the  participant was married on the annuity starting date is entitled to the  QJSA protection under the plan. The spouse is entitled to this  protection (unless waived and consented to by such spouse) even if the  participant and spouse are not married on the date of the participant's  death, except as provided in a QDRO.</p><p class="depth0">Q-26: In the case of a defined contribution plan not subject to  section 412, does the requirement that a participant's nonforfeitable  accrued benefit be payable in full to a surviving spouse apply to a  spouse who has been married to the participant for less than one year?</p><p class="depth0">A-26: A plan may provide that a spouse who has not been married to a  participant throughout the one-year period ending on the earlier of (a)  the participant's annuity starting date or (b) the date of the  participant's death is not treated as a surviving spouse and is not  required to receive the participant's account balance. The special  exception described in section 417(d)(2) and Q&A; 25 of this section does  not apply.</p><p class="depth0">Q-27: Are there circumstances when spousal consent to a  participant's election to waive the QJSA or the QPSA is not required?</p><p class="depth0">A-27: Yes. If it is established to the satisfaction of a plan  representative that there is no spouse or that the spouse cannot be  located, spousal consent to waive the QJSA or the QPSA is not required.  If the spouse is legally incompetnent to give consent, the spouse's  legal guardian, even if the guardian is the participant, may give  consent. Also, if the participant is legally separated or the  participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the  participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is not  required unless a QDRO provides otherwise. Similar rules apply to a plan  subject to the requirements of section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii)(I).</p><p class="depth0">Q-28: Does consent contained in an antenuptial agreement or similar  contract entered into prior to marriage satisfy the consent requirements  of sections 401(a)(11) and 417?</p><p class="depth0">A-28: No. An agreement entered into prior to marriage does not  satisfy the applicable consent requirements, even if the agreement is  executed within the applicable election period.</p><p class="depth0">Q-29: If a participant's spouse consents under section 417(a)(2)(A)  to the participant's waiver of a survivor annuity form of benefit, is a  subsequent spouse of the same participant bound by the consent?</p><p class="depth0">A-29: No. A consent under section 417(a)(2)(A) by one spouse is  binding only with respect to the consenting spouse. See Q&A-24; of this  section for an exception in the case of plan benefits securing plan  loans.</p><p class="depth0">Q-30: Does the spousal consent requirement of section 417(a)(2)(A)  require that a spouse's consent be revocable?</p><p class="depth0">A-30: No. A plan may preclude a spouse from revoking consent once it  has been given. Alternatively, a plan may also permit a spouse to revoke  a consent after it has been given, and thereby to render ineffective the  participant's prior election not to receive a QPSA or QJSA. A  participant must always be allowed to change his election during the  applicable election period. Spousal consent is required in such cases to  the extent provided in Q&A; 31, except that spousal consent is never  required for a QJSA or QPSA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-31: What rules govern a participant's waiver of a QPSA or QJSA  under section 417(a)(2)?</p><p class="depth0">A-31: (a) Specific beneficiary. Both the participant's waivers of a  QPSA and QJSA and the spouse's consents thereto must state the specific  nonspouse beneficiary (including any class of beneficiaries or any  contingent beneficiaries) who will receive the benefit. Thus, for  example, if spouse B consents to participant A's election to waive a  QPSA, and to have any benefits payable upon A's death before the annuity  starting date paid to A's children, A   may not subsequently change beneficiaries without the consent of B  (except if the change is back to a QPSA). If the designated beneficiary  is a trust, A's spouse need only consent to the designation of the trust  and need not consent to the designation of trust beneficiaries or any  changes of trust beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Optional form of benefit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> QJSA. Both the participant's  waiver of a QJSA (and any required spouse's consent thereto) must  specify the particular optional form of benefit. The participant who has  waived a QJSA with the spouse's consent in favor of another form of  benefit may not subsequently change the optional form of benefit without  obtaining the spouse's consent (except back to a QJSA). Of course, the  participant may change the form of benefit if the plan so provides after  the spouse's death or a divorce (other than as provided in a QDRO). A  participant's waiver of a QJSA (and any required spouse's consent  thereto) made prior to the first plan year beginning after December 31,  1986, is not required to specify the optional form of benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> QPSA. A participant's waiver of a QPSA and the spouse's consent  thereto are not required to specify the optional form of any  preretirement benefit. Thus, a participant who waives the QPSA with  spousal consent may subsequently change the form of the preretirement  benefit, but not the nonspouse beneficiary, without obtaining the  spouse's consent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Change in form. After the participant's death, a beneficiary may  change the optional form of survivor benefit as permitted by the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> shall  apply to the extent that the limited general consent is applicable. A  general consent, including a limited general consent, is not effective  unless it is made during the applicable election period. A general  consent executed prior to October 22, 1986 does not have to satisfy the  specificity requirements of this Q&A; 31.</p><p class="depth0">Q-32: What rules govern a participant's waiver of the spousal  benefit under section 401(a)(11)(B)?</p><p class="depth0">A-32: (a) Application. In the case of a defined contribution plan  that is not subject to the survivor annuity requirements of sections  401(a)(11) and 417, a participant may waive the spousal benefit of  section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii) if the conditions of paragraph (b) are  satisfied. In general, a spousal benefit is the nonforfeitable account  balance on the participant's date of death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions. In general, the same conditions, other than the age  35 requirement, that apply to the participant's waiver of a QPSA and the  spouse's consent thereto apply to the participant's waiver of the  spousal benefit and the spouse's consent thereto. See Q&A-31.; Thus, the  participant's waiver of the spousal benefit must state the specific  nonspouse beneficiary who will receive such benefit. The waiver is not  required to specify the optional form of benefit. The participant may  change the optional form of benefit, but not the nonspouse beneficiary,  without obtaining the spouse's consent.</p><p class="depth0">Q-33: When and in what manner, may a participant waive a spousal  benefit or a QPSA?</p><p class="depth0">A-33: (a) Plans not subject to section 401(a)(11). A participant in  a plan that is not subject to the survivor annuity requirements of  section 401(a)(11) (because of subparagraph (B)(iii) thereof) may waive  the spousal benefit at any   time, provided that no such waiver shall be effective unless the spouse  has consented to the waiver. The spouse may consent to a waiver of the  spousal benefit at any time, even prior to the participant's attaining  age 35. No spousal consent is required for a payment to the participant  or the use of the accrued benefit as security for a plan loan to the  participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plans subject to section 401(a)(11). A participant in a plan  subject to the survivor annuity requirements of section 401(a)(11)  generally may waive the QPSA benefit (with spousal consent) only on or  after the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains  age 35. However, a plan may provide for an earlier waiver (with spousal  consent), provided that a written explanation of the QPSA is given to  the participant and such waiver becomes invalid upon the beginning of  the plan year in which the participant's 35th birthday occurs. If there  is no new waiver after such date, the participant's spouse must receive  the QPSA benefit upon the participant's death.</p><p class="depth0">Q-34: Must the written explanations required by section 417(a)(3) be  provided to nonvested participants?</p><p class="depth0">A-34: Such written explantions must be provided to nonvested  participants who are employed by an employer maintaining the plan. Thus,  they are not required to be provided to those nonvested participants who  are no longer employed by such an employer.</p><p class="depth0">Q-35: When must a plan provide the written explanation, required by  section 417(a)(3)(B), of the QPSA to a participant?</p><p class="depth0">A-35: (a) General rule. A plan must provide the written explanation  of the QPSA to a participant within the applicable period. Except as  provided in paragraph (b), the applicable period means, with respect to  a participant, whichever of the following periods ends last:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The period beginning with the first day of the plan year in  which the participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the  plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant attains age  35.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A reasonable period ending after the individual becomes a  participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A reasonable period ending after the QPSA is no longer fully  subsidized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A reasonable period ending after section 401(a)(11) first  applies to the participant. Section 401(a)(11) would first apply when a  benefit is transferred from a plan not subject to the survivor annuity  requirements of section 401(a)(11) to a plan subject to such section or  at the time of an election of an annuity under a defined contribution  plan described in section 401(a)(11)(B)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pre-35 separations. In the case of a participant who separates  from service before attaining age 35, the applicable period means the  period beginning one year before the separation from service and ending  one year after such separation. If such a participant returns to  service, the plan must also comply with pragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable period. For purposes of applying paragraph (a), a  reasonable period ending after the enumerated events described in  paragraphs (a) (2), (3) and (4) is the end of the one-year period  beginning with the date the applicable event occurs. The applicable  period for such events begins one year prior to the occurrence of the  enumerated events.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transition rule. In the case of an individual who was a  participant in the plan on August 23, 1984, and, as of that date had  attained age 34, the plan will satisfy the requriement of section  417(a)(3)(B) if it provided the explanation not later than December 31,  1985.</p><p class="depth0">Q-36: How do plans satisfy the requirements of providing  participants explanations of QPSAs and QJSAs?</p><p class="depth0">A-36. For rules regarding the explanation of QPSAs and QJSAs  required under section 417(a)(3), see Sec. 1.417(a)(3)-1. However, the  rules of Sec. 1.401(a)-20, Q&A-36;, as it appeared in 26 CFR part 1  revised April 1, 2003, apply to the explanation of a QJSA under section  417(a)(3) for an annuity starting date prior to February 1, 2006.</p><p class="depth0">Q-37: What are the consequences of fully subsidizing the cost of  either a QJSA or a QPSA in accordance with section 417(a)(5)?</p><p class="depth0">A-37: If a plan fully subsidizes a QJSA or QPSA in accordance with  section 417(a)(5) and does not allow a participant to waive such QJSA or  QPSA or to select a nonspouse beneficiary, the plan is not required to  provide the written explanation required by section 417(a)(3). However,  if the plan offers an election to waive the benefit or designate a  beneficiary, it must satisfy the election, consent, and notice  requirements of section 417(a) (1), (2), and (3), with respect to such  subsidized QJSA or QPSA, in accordance with section 417(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Q-38: What is a fully subsidized benefit?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A fully subsidized QJSA is one  under which no increase in cost to, or decrease in actual amounts  received by, the participant may result from the participant's failure  to elect another form of benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. . If a plan provides a joint and survivor annuity and a  single sum option, the plan does not fully subsidize the joint and  survivor annuity, regardless of the actuarial value of the joint and  survivor annuity because, in the event of the participant's early death,  the participant would have received less under the annuity than he would  have received under the single sum option.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. . If a plan provides for a life annuity of $100 per month  and a joint and 100% survivor benefit of $99 per month, the plan does  not fully subsidize the joint and survivor benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> QPSA. A QPSA is fully subsidized if the amount of the  participant's benefit is not reduced because of the QPSA coverage and if  no charge to the participant under the plan is made for the coverage.  Thus, a QPSA is fully subsidized in a defined contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-39: When do the survivor annuity requirements of sections  401(a)(11) and 417 apply to plans?</p><p class="depth0">A-39: Sections 401(a)(11) and 417 generally apply to plan years  beginning after December 31, 1984. Sections 302 and 303 of REA 1984  provide specific effective dates and transitional rules under which the  QJSA or QPSA (or pre-REA 1984 section 401(a)(11)) requirements may be  applicable to particular plans or with respect to benefits provided to  (as amended by REA 1984) particular participants. In general, the  section 401(a)(11) (as amended by REA 1984) survivor annuity  requirements do not apply with respect to a participant who does not  have at least one hour of service or one hour of paid leave under the  plan after August 22, 1984.</p><p class="depth0">Q-40: Are there special effective dates for plans maintained  pursuant to collective bargaining agreements?</p><p class="depth0">A-40: Yes. Section 302(b) of REA 1984 as amended by section 1898(g)  of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provides a special deferred effective date  for such plans. Whether a plan is described in section 302(b) of REA  1984 is determined under the principles applied under section 1017(c) of  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. See H.R. Rep. No.  1280, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 266 (1974). In addition, a plan will not be  treated as maintained under a collective bargaining agreement unless the  employee representatives satisfy section 7701(a)(46) of the Internal  Revenue Code after March 31, 1984. See Sec. 301.7701-17T for other  requirements for a plan to be considered to be collectively bargained.  Nothing in section 302(b) of REA 1984 denies a participant or spouse the  rights set forth in sections 303(c)(2), 303(c)(3), 303(e)(1), and  303(e)(2) of REA 1984.</p><p class="depth0">Q-41: What is one hour of service or paid leave under the plan for  purposes of the transition rules in section 303 of REA 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-41: One hour of service or paid leave under the plan is one hour  of service or paid leave recognized or required to be recognized under  the plan for any purpose, e.g., participation, vesting percentage, or  benefit accrual purposes. For plans that do not compute hours of  service, one hour of service or paid leave means any service or paid  leave recognized or required to be recognized under the plan for any  purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Q-42: Must a plan be amended to provide for the QPSA required by  section 303(c)(2) of REA 1984, or for the survivor annuities required by  section 303(e) of REA 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-42: A plan will not fail to satisfy the qualification requirements  of section 401(a) or 403(a) merely because it is not amended to provide  the QPSA required by section 303(c)(2) or the survivor annuities  required by section   303(e). The plan must, however, satisfy those requirements in operation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-43: Is a participant's election, or a spouse's consent to an  election, with respect to a QPSA, made before August 23, 1984, valid?</p><p class="depth0">A-43: No.</p><p class="depth0">Q-44: Is spousal consent required for certain survivor annuity  elections made by the participant after December 31, 1984, and before  the first plan year to which new sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-44: Yes. Section 303(c)(3) of REA 1984 provides that any election  not to take a QJSA made after December 31, 1984, and before the date  sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply to the plan by a participant who has 1  hour of service or leave under the plan after August 23, 1984, is not  effective unless the spousal consent requirements of section 417 are met  with respect to such election. Unless the participant's annuity starting  date occurred before January 1, 1985, the spousal consent required by  section 417 (a)(2) and (e) must be obtained even though the participant  elected the benefit prior to January 1, 1985. The plan is not required  to be amended to comply with section 303(c)(3) of REA 1984, but the plan  must satisfy this requirement in operation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-45: Are there special rules for certain participants who separated  from service prior to August 23, 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-45: Yes. Section 303(e) of REA 1984 provides special rules for  certain participants who separated from service before August 23, 1984.  Section 303(e)(1), which applies only to plans subject to section  401(a)(11) of the Code (as in effect on August 22, 1984), provides that  participants whose annuity starting date did not occur before August 24,  1984, and who had one hour of service on or after September 2, 1974, but  not in a plan year beginning after December 31, 1975, may elect to  receive the benefits required to be provided under section 401(a)(11) of  the Code (as in effect on August 22, 1984). Section 303(e)(2) provides  that certain participants who had one hour of service in a plan year  beginning on or after January 1, 1976, but not after August 22, 1984,  may elect QPSA coverage under new sections 401(a)(11) and 417 in plans  subject to these provisions. Section 303(e)(4)(A) requires plans or plan  administrators to notify those participants of the provisions of section  303(e).</p><p class="depth0">Q-46: When must a plan provide the notice required by section  303(e)(4)(A) of REA 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-46: The notice required by section 303(e)(4)(A) must be provided  no later than the earlier of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The date the first summary annual report provided after  September 17, 1985, is distributed to participants; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> September 30, 1985.  A plan will not fail to satisfy the preceding sentence if the plan  provides a fully subsidized QPSA with respect to any participant  described in section 303(e) who dies on or after July 19, 1985, and  before the notice is received. If the plan ceases to fully subsidize the  QPSA, the cessation must not be effective until the notice is given. For  this purpose, an annuity payable to a nonspouse beneficiary elected by  the participant, in lieu of a spouse, shall satisfy the QPSA  requirement, so long as the survivor benefit is fully subsidized. The  notice required by this paragraph must be in writing and sent to the  participant's last known address.</p><p class="depth0">Q-47: Is there another time when plans must provide notice of the  right, described in section 303(e)(1) of REA '84, to elect a pre-REA  1984 qualified joint and survivor annuity?</p><p class="depth0">A-47: Yes. Notice of this right must also be provided to a  participant at the time the participant applies for benefit payments.

This section provides rules relating to the use of an  electronic medium to provide applicable notices and to make participant  elections as defined in paragraph (e)(1) and (6) of this section   with respect to retirement plans, employee benefit arrangements, and  individual retirement plans described in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section. The rules in this section reflect the provisions of the  Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, Public Law  106-229 (114 Stat. 464 (2000) (E-SIGN)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notices and elections required to be in writing or in written  form--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The rules of this section must be satisfied in  order to use an electronic medium to provide an applicable notice or to  make a participant election if the notice or election is required to be  in writing or in written form under the Internal Revenue Code,  Department of Treasury regulations, or other guidance issued by the  Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Rules relating to applicable notices. An applicable notice that  is provided using an electronic medium is treated as being provided in  writing or in written form if and only if the requirements of paragraph  (a)(5) of this section are satisfied and either the consumer consent  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or the requirements for  exemption from the consumer consent requirements under paragraph (c) of  this section are satisfied. For example, in order to provide a section  402(f) notice electronically, a qualified plan must satisfy either the  consumer consent requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or the  requirements for exemption under paragraph (c) of this section. If a  plan fails to satisfy either of these requirements, the plan must  provide the section 402(f) notice using a written paper document in  order to satisfy the requirements of section 402(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Rules relating to participant elections. A participant election  that is made using an electronic medium is treated as being provided in  writing or in written form if and only if the requirements of paragraphs  (a)(5) and (d) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Safe harbor method for applicable notices and participant  elections that are not required to be in writing or written form. For an  applicable notice or a participant election that is not required to be  in writing or in written form, the rules of this section provide a safe  harbor method for using an electronic medium to provide the applicable  notice or to make the participant election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notices, elections, or consents under  retirement plans. The rules of this section apply to any applicable  notice or any participant election relating to the following retirement  plans: A qualified retirement plan under section 401(a) or 403(a); a  section 403(b) plan; a simplified employee pension (SEP) under section  408(k); a simple retirement plan under section 408(p); or an eligible  governmental plan under section 457(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notices, elections, or consents under other employee benefit  arrangements. The rules of this section also apply to any applicable  notice or any participant election relating to the following employee  benefit arrangements: An accident and health plan or arrangement under  sections 104(a)(3) and 105; a cafeteria plan under section 125; an  educational assistance program under section 127; a qualified  transportation fringe program under section 132; an Archer MSA under  section 220; or a health savings account under section 223.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Notices, elections, or consents under individual retirement  plans. The rules of this section also apply to any applicable notice or  any participant election relating to individual retirement plans,  including a Roth IRA under section 408A; or a deemed IRA under a  qualified employer plan described in section 408(q).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on application of rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The rules of  this section do not apply to any notice, election, consent, disclosure,  or obligation required under the provisions of title I or IV of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA),  over which the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation has interpretative and enforcement authority. For example,  the rules in 29 CFR 2520.104b-1 of the Department of Labor Regulations  apply with respect to an employee benefit plan providing disclosure  documents, such as a summary plan description or a summary annual  report. The rules in this section also do not apply to Internal Revenue  Code section 411(a)(3)(B) (relating to suspension of benefits), Internal  Revenue Code section 4980B(f)(6)   (relating to an individual's COBRA rights), or any other Internal  Revenue Code provision over which Department of Labor or the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation has similar interpretative authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recordkeeping and other requirements. The rules in this section  only apply with respect to applicable notices and participant elections  relating to an individual's rights under a retirement plan, an employee  benefit arrangement, or an individual retirement plan. Thus, the rules  in this section do not alter the otherwise applicable requirements under  the Internal Revenue Code, such as the requirements relating to tax  reporting, tax records, or substantiation of expenses. See section 6001  for rules relating to the maintenance of records, statements, and  special returns. See also section 101(e) of E-SIGN, which provides that  if an electronic record of an applicable notice or a participant  election is not maintained in a form that is capable of being retained  and accurately reproduced for later reference, then the legal effect,  validity, or enforceability of such electronic record may be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> General requirements related to applicable notices and  participant elections. The rules of this section supplement the general  requirements related to each applicable notice and participant election.  Thus, in addition to satisfying the rules for timing and content, the  rules in this section must be satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requirements related to the design of an electronic system used  to deliver applicable notices and to make participant elections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The  electronic system must take into account the content of a notice. With  respect to the content of an applicable notice, the electronic system  must be reasonably designed to provide the information in the notice to  a recipient in a manner that is no less understandable to the recipient  than a written paper document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of the significance of information in the  notice. The electronic system must be designed to alert the recipient,  at the time an applicable notice is provided, to the significance of the  information in the notice (including identification of the subject  matter of the notice), and provide any instructions needed to access the  notice, in a manner that is readily understandable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Consumer consent requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirements. With respect to  an applicable notice, the consumer consent requirements of this  paragraph (b) are satisfied if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this  section are satisfied; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In accordance with section 101(c)(6) of E-SIGN, the applicable  notice is not provided through the use of oral communication or a  recording of an oral communication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consent--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The recipient must affirmatively  consent to the delivery of the applicable notice using an electronic  medium. This consent must be either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Made electronically in a manner that reasonably demonstrates  that the recipient can access the applicable notice in the electronic  medium in the form that will be used to provide the notice; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Made using a written paper document (or using another form not  described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section), but only if the  recipient confirms the consent electronically in a manner that  reasonably demonstrates that the recipient can access the applicable  notice in the electronic medium in the form that will be used to provide  the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Withdrawal of consumer consent. The consent to receive  electronic delivery requirement of this paragraph (b)(2) is not  satisfied if the recipient withdraws his or her consent before the  applicable notice is delivered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (v) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Right to receive paper document--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The statement  informs the recipient of any right to have the applicable notice be  provided using a written paper document or other nonelectronic form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Post-consent request for paper copy. The statement informs the  recipient how, after having provided consent to   receive the applicable notice electronically, the recipient may, upon  request, obtain a paper copy of the applicable notice and whether any  fee will be charged for such copy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Right to withdraw consumer consent.

The statement informs the  recipient whether the consent to receive electronic delivery of an  applicable notice applies only to the particular transaction that gave  rise to the applicable notice or to other identified transactions that  may be provided or made available during the course of the parties'  relationship. For example, the statement may provide that a recipient's  consent to receive electronic delivery will apply to all future  applicable notices of the recipient relating to the employee benefit  arrangement until the recipient is no longer a participant in the  employee benefit arrangement (or withdraws the consent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Description of the contact procedures.

This  paragraph (d) is satisfied if the conditions described in the following  paragraphs (d)(2) through (6) are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective ability to access. The electronic medium under an  electronic system used to make a participant election must be a medium  that the person who is eligible to make the election is effectively able  to access. If the appropriate individual is not effectively able to  access the electronic medium for making the participant election, the  participant election will not be treated as made available to that  individual. Thus, for example, the participant election will not be  treated as made available to that individual for purposes of the rules  under section 401(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Opportunity to review.

The term recipient means a plan participant,  beneficiary, employee, alternate payee, or any other person to whom an  applicable notice is to be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section. Examples 1, 2, 3, and 6 assume that the requirements of  paragraph (a)(4) and (5) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts involving using the consumer consent  requirements to deliver a section 402(f) notice via e-mail. Plan A, a  qualified plan, permits participants to request benefit distributions  from the plan on Plan A's Internet Web site. Under Plan A's system for  such transactions, a participant must enter his or her account number,  personal identification number (PIN), and his or her e-mail address to  which the notice is to be sent. The participant's PIN and account number  must match the information in Plan A's records in order for the  transaction to proceed. Participant H requests a distribution from Plan  A on Plan A's Web site, and, at the time of the request for  distribution, a disclosure statement appears on the computer screen that  explains that Participant H can consent to receive the section 402(f)  notice electronically. The disclosure statement provides information  relating to the consent, including how to receive a paper copy of the  notice, how to withdraw consent, the hardware and software requirements,  and the procedures for accessing the section 402(f) notice, which is in  a file format from a specific spreadsheet program. After reviewing the  disclosure statement, which satisfies the requirements of paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, Participant H consents to receive the section  402(f) notice via e-mail by selecting the consent button at the end of  the disclosure statement. As a part of the consent procedure, an e-mail  is sent to Participant H's e-mail address in order to demonstrate that  Participant H can access the spreadsheet program. In the e-mail,  Participant H is prompted to answer a question from the spreadsheet  program, which is in an attachment to the e-mail. Once Participant H  correctly answers the question, the section 402(f) notice is then  delivered to Participant H via e-mail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 1, Plan A's delivery of the section  402(f) notice to Participant H satisfies the requirements of paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Facts involving using the alternative  method to deliver a section 411(a)(11) notice via e-mail. Plan B, a  qualified plan, permits participants to request benefit distributions  from the plan on Plan B's Internet Web site. Under Plan B's system for  such transactions, a participant must enter his or her account number  and personal identification number (PIN), and his or her e-mail address  to which the notice is to be sent. The participant's PIN and account  number must match the information in Plan B's records in order for the  transaction to proceed. After Participant K, a single employee, requests  a distribution from Plan B on Plan B's Internet Web site, the plan  administrator provides Participant K with a section 411(a)(11) notice in  an attachment to an e-mail. Plan B sends the e-mail with a request for a  computer generated notification that the message was received and  opened. The e-mail instructs Participant K to read the attachment for  important information regarding the request for a distribution. In  addition, the e-mail also states that Participant K may request the  section 411(a)(11) notice on a written paper document and that, if  Participant K requests the notice on a written paper document, it will  be provided at no charge. Plan B receives notification indicating that  the e-mail was received and opened by Participant K.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Facts involving making a participant's consent to a  distribution. In order to consent to a distribution, Plan B requires a  participant to enter the participant's account number and PIN in order  to preclude any person other than the participant from making the  election. After the authentication process, Participant K completes a  distribution request form on the Web site. After completing the request  form, the Web site provides a summary of the information entered on the  form and gives Participant K an opportunity to review or modify the  distribution request form before the transaction is completed. Within a  reasonable period of time after Participant K consents to the  distribution, the plan administrator, by e-mail, sends confirmation of  the terms (including the form) of the distribution to Participant K and  advises Participant K that, upon request, the confirmation may be  provided to Participant K on a written paper document at no charge. Plan  B retains an electronic copy of the consent to the distribution in a  form that is capable of being retained and accurately reproduced for  later reference by Participant K.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 2, Plan B's delivery of the section  411(a)(11) notice and the electronic system used to make Participant K's  consent to a distribution satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a),  (c), and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts involving the transmission of a spousal consent  via electronic notarization. Plan C, a qualified money purchase pension  plan, permits a married participant to request a plan loan through the  Plan C's Internet Web site with the notarized consent of the spouse.  Under Plan C's system for requesting a plan loan, a participant must  enter his or her account number, personal identification number (PIN),  and his or her e-mail address. The information entered by the  participant must match the information in Plan C's records in order for  the transaction to proceed. Participant M, a married participant, is  effectively able to access the Web site available to apply for a plan  loan. In order to apply for a loan, Plan C requires   a participant to enter the participant's account number and PIN in order  to preclude any person other than the participant from making the  election. Participant M completes the loan application on Plan C's Web  site. Within a reasonable period of time after submitting the plan loan  application, the plan administrator, by e-mail, sends Participant M the  loan application, including all attachments setting forth the terms of  the loan agreement and all other required information. In the e-mail,  Plan C also notifies Participant M that, upon request, the loan  application may be provided to Participant M on a written paper document  at no charge. Plan C then instructs Participant M that, in order for the  loan application to proceed, Participant M must submit to the plan  administrator a notarized spousal consent form. Participant M and M's  spouse go to a notary public and the notary witnesses Participant M's  spouse signing the spousal consent for the loan agreement on an  electronic signature capture pad with adequate security. After  witnessing M's spouse signing the spousal consent, the notary public  sends an e-mail with an electronic acknowledgement that is attached to  or logically associated with the signature of M's spouse to the plan  administrator. The electronic acknowledgement is in accordance with  section 101(g) of E-SIGN and the relevant State law applicable to notary  publics. After the plan receives the e-mail, Plan C sends an e-mail to  Participant M, giving M a reasonable period to review and confirm the  completed loan application and to determine whether the loan application  should be modified or rescinded. In addition, the e-mail to Participant  M also provides that M may request the completed loan application on a  written paper document and that, if M requests the written paper  document, it will be provided at no charge. Plan C retains an electronic  copy of the loan agreement, including the spousal consent, in a form  that is capable of being retained and accurately reproduced for later  reference by all parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 3, the transmission of the plan  loan agreement satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (a), (c), and  (d) of this section. By requiring that the spouse sign the spousal  consent on an electronic signature capture pad in the physical presence  of a notary public, the electronic system satisfies the requirement that  the system be reasonably designed to preclude any person other than the  appropriate individual from making the election. Thus, the electronic  notarization of spousal consent satisfies the requirements of paragraphs  (a) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Facts involving using the alternative  method of compliance to deliver a section 411(a)(11) notice via an  automated telephone system. A qualified profit-sharing plan (Plan D)  permits participants to request distributions through an automated  telephone system. Under Plan D's system for such transactions, a  participant must enter his or her account number and personal  identification number (PIN); this information must match the information  in Plan D's records in order for the transaction to proceed. Plan D  provides only the following distribution options: single-sum payment;  and annual installments over 5, 10, or 20 years. Participant N, a single  participant, requests a distribution from Plan D by following the  applicable instructions on the automated telephone system. After  Participant N has requested the distribution, the automated telephone  system recites the section 411(a)(11) notice over the phone. The  automated telephone system also advises Participant N that, upon  request, the notice may be provided on a written paper document and  that, if Participant N so requests, the notice will be provided on a  written paper document at no charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Facts involving making a participant's consent to a distribution  via an automated telephone system. In order to consent to a  distribution, Plan D requires a participant to enter the participant's  account number and PIN in order to preclude any person other than the  participant from making the election. Participant N requests a  distribution by entering information on the automated telephone system.  After completing the request, the automated telephone system provides a  oral summary of the information entered and gives Participant N an  opportunity to review or modify the distribution request before the  transaction is completed. Plan D's automated telephone system confirms  the distribution request to Participant N and advises Participant N  that, upon request, a confirmation may be provided on a written paper  document at no charge. Plan D retains an electronic copy of the consent  to the distribution in a form that is capable of being retained and  accurately reproduced for later reference by Participant N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 4, because Plan D has relatively  few and simple distribution options, the provision of the section  411(a)(11) notice through the automated telephone system is no less  understandable to the participant than a written paper notice for  purposes of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. In addition, the  automated telephone procedures of Plan D satisfy the applicable  requirements of paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 4 of this paragraph (f),  except that, pursuant to Plan D's system for processing such  transactions, a participant who so requests is transferred to a customer  service representative whose conversation with the participant is  recorded. The customer service representative provides the section  411(a)(11) notice   from a prepared text and processes the participant's distribution in  accordance with the predetermined instructions from the plan  administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. As in Example 4 of this paragraph (f), because Plan  D has relatively few and simple distribution options, the provision of  the section 411(a)(11) notice through the automated telephone system is  no less understandable to the participant than a written paper notice  for purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Further, in this  Example 5, the customer service telephone procedures of Plan D satisfy  the requirements of paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan E, a qualified plan, permits participants  to request distributions by e-mail on the employer's e-mail system.  Under this system, a participant must enter his or her account number,  personal identification number (PIN), and e-mail address. This  information must match that in Plan E's records in order for the  transaction to proceed. If a participant requests a distribution by e- mail, the plan administrator provides the participant with a section  411(a)(11) notice by e-mail. The plan administrator also advises the  participant by e-mail that he or she may request the section 411(a)(11)  notice on a written paper document and that, if the participant requests  the notice on a written paper document, it will be provided at no  charge. Participant Q requests a distribution and receives the section  411(a)(11) notice from the plan administrator by reply e-mail. However,  before Participant Q elects a distribution, Q terminates employment.  Following termination of employment, Participant Q no longer has access  to the employer's e-mail system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this Example 6, Plan E does not satisfy the  participant election requirements under paragraph (d) of this section  because Participant Q is not effectively able to access the electronic  medium used to make the participant election. Plan E must provide  Participant Q with the opportunity to make the participant election  through a written paper document or another system that Participant Q is  effectively able to access, such as the automated telephone systems  described in Example 4 and Example 5 of this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. The rules provided in this section apply to  applicable notices provided, and to participant elections made, on or  after January 1, 2007. However, a retirement plan, an employee benefit  arrangement, or an individual retirement plan that provides an  applicable notice or makes a participant election that complies with the  requirements set forth in these regulations on or after October 1, 2000,  and before January 1, 2007, will not be treated as failing to provide an  applicable notice or to make a participant election merely because the  notice or election was not in writing or written form.

A plan administrator may make an  election under ERISA section 1022(i)(2) by filing a statement making the  election, along with a copy of the plan, with the Director's  Representative of the Internal Revenue Service in Puerto Rico. The  statement making the election must indicate that it is being made under  ERISA section 1022(i)(2). The statement may also be filed in conjunction  with a written request for a determination letter. If the election is  made with a written request for a determination letter, the election may  be conditioned upon issuance of a favorable determination letter and  will be irrevocable upon issuance of such letter. Otherwise, once made,  an election is irrevocable. It is generally effective for plan years  beginning after the date it has been made. However, an election made  before March 3, 1983 may, at the option of the plan administrator at the  time he or she makes the election, be considered to have been made on  any date between September 2, 1974, and the actual date of the election.  The election will then be effective for plan years beginning on or after  the date chosen by the plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Annuities, custodial accounts, etc. See section 401 (f) for  rules relating to the treatment of certain annuities, custodial accounts  or other contracts, as trusts for purposes of section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Source of plan distributions to participants and beneficiaries  residing outside the United States. Except as provided under section  871(f) (relating to amounts received as an annuity by nonresident  aliens), the amount of a distribution from an electing plan that is to  be treated as income from sources within the United States is determined  as described below. The portion of the distribution considered to be a  return of employer contributions is to be treated as income from sources  within the United States in an amount equal to the portion of the  distribution considered to be a return of employer contributions  multiplied by the following fraction:  Days of performance of labor or services within the United States for  the employer. ________________________________________________________________________ Total days of performance of labor or services for the employer.   The days of performance of labor or services within the United States  shall not include the time period for which the employee's compensation  is deemed not to be income from sources within the United States under  subtitle A of the Code. Thus, for example, if an employee's compensation  was not deemed to be income from sources within the United States under  section 861(a)(3), then the time the emloyee was present in the United  States while such compensation was earned would not be included in  determining the days of performance of labor or services within the  United States in the numerator of the above fraction. In addition, days  of performance of labor or services for the employer in both the  numerator and denominator of the above fraction are limited to days of  plan participation by the employee and any service used for determining  an employee's accrued benefit under the   plan. The remaining portion of the distribution, that is, any amount  other than the portion of the distribution considered to be a return of  employer contributions, is not to be treated as income from sources  within the United States. For example, if a distribution consists of  amounts representing employer contributions, employee contributions, and  earnings on employer and employee contributions, no part of the portion  of the distribution attributable to employee contributions, or earnings  on employer and employee contributions, will be treated as income from  sources within the United States.

Section 401(a)(2) provides that a  contribution or payment of withdrawal liability made to a multiemployer  plan due to a mistake of fact or mistake of law can be returned to the  employer under certain conditions. This section specifies the conditions  under which an employer's contribution or payment may be returned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective dates. This section applies to refunds made after July  22, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions for return of contribution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the  case of a contribution or a withdrawal liability payment to a  multiemployer plan which was made because of a mistake of fact or a  mistake of law, the plan will not violate section 401(a)(2) merely  because the contribution or payment is returned within six months after  the date on which the plan administrator determines that the  contribution or payment was the result of a mistake of fact or law. The  contribution or payment is considered as returned within the required  period if the employer establishes a right to a refund of the amount  mistakenly contributed or paid by filing a claim with the plan  administrator within six months after the date on which the plan  administrator determines that a mistake did occur. For purposes of this  section, plan administrator is defined in section 414(g) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicable conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The employer making the  contribution or withdrawal liability payment to a multiemployer plan  must demonstrate that an excessive contribution or overpayment has been  made due to a mistake of fact or law. A mistake of fact or law relating  to plan qualification under section 401 or to trust exemption under  section 501 is not considered to be a mistake of fact or law which  entitles an employer to a refund under this section. For purposes of  this section, a multiemployer plan is defined in section 414(f) and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount to be returned--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. The amount to be  returned to the employer is the excess of the amount contributed or paid  over the amount that would have been contributed or paid had no mistake  been made. This amount is the excess contribution or overpayment. Except  as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, interest or  earnings attributable to an excess contribution shall not be returned to  the employer, and any losses attributable to an excess contribution must  reduce the amount returned to the employer. For purposes of the previous  sentence, the application of plan-wide investment experience to the  excess contribution would be an acceptable method of calculating losses.  A refund of a mistaken contribution must in no event reduce a  participant's account balance in a defined contribution plan to an  amount less than that amount which would properly have been in that  participant's account had no mistake occurred. Thus, to the extent that  the refund of an excess contribution would reduce a participant's  account balance in a defined contribution plan to an amount less than  the amount which would properly be in the participant's account had no  mistake occurred, the return of the excess contribution would be  prohibited by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Overpayment of withdrawal liability. In the case of an  overpayment of withdrawal liability established by the plan sponsor  under section 4219(c)(2) of ERISA, the plan will not fail to satisfy  section 401(a)(2) if, in accordance with   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation regulations regarding the  overpayments of withdrawal liability (29 CFR 4219.31(d)), the  overpayment, with interest, is returned to the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount refunded includible in employer's income. In general, the  amount of the excess contribution or overpayment must be included in  gross income by the employer if the excess contribution or overpayment  resulted in a tax benefit in a prior year. Any interest credited or paid  on the refund of mistaken withdrawal liability payments must also be  included in gross income by the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application of section 412. An amount returned under paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section is charged to the funding standard account  under section 412 in the year in which the amount is returned.

In order to  satisfy section 401(a)(4), a plan must satisfy each of the requirements  of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nondiscriminatory amount of contributions or benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. Either the contributions or the benefits provided under  the plan must be nondiscriminatory in amount. It need not be shown that  both the contributions and the benefits provided are nondiscriminatory  in amount, but only that either the contributions alone or the benefits  alone are nondiscriminatory in amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Defined contribution plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. A defined  contribution plan satisfies this paragraph (b)(2) if the contributions  allocated under the plan (including forfeitures) are nondiscriminatory  in amount under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2. Alternatively, a defined  contribution plan (other than an ESOP) satisfies this paragraph (b)(2)  if the equivalent benefits provided under the plan are nondiscriminatory  in amount under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(b). Section 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)  includes a safe-harbor testing method for contributions provided under a  target benefit plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, because they are not treated as part of a  section 401(k) plan or section 401(m) plan as those terms are defined in  Sec. 1.410(b)-9. The contributions described in the preceding sentence  must satisfy paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Defined benefit plans. A defined benefit plan satisfies this  paragraph (b)(2) if the benefits provided under the plan are  nondiscriminatory in amount under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3. Alternatively, a  defined benefit plan satisfies this paragraph (b)(2) if the equivalent  allocations provided under the plan are nondiscriminatory in amount  under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(c). Section 1.401(a)(4)-8(c) includes a safe- harbor testing method for benefits provided under a cash balance plan.  In addition, Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(d) provides a safe-harbor testing  method for benefits provided under a defined benefit plan that is part  of a floor-offset arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nondiscriminatory availability of benefits, rights, and  features. All benefits, rights, and features provided under the plan  must be made available in the plan in a nondiscriminatory manner. Rules  for determining whether this requirement is satisfied are set forth in  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)-5(b)</em> provides additional requirements regarding plan  terminations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section must be applied in accordance with the  rules set forth in this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interpretation. The provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1  through 1.401(a)(4)-13 must be interpreted in a reasonable manner  consistent with the purpose of preventing discrimination in favor of  HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan-year basis of testing. The requirements of paragraph (b) of  this section are generally applied on the basis of the plan year and on  the basis of the terms of the plan in effect during the plan year. Thus,  unless otherwise provided, the compensation, contributions, benefit  accruals, and other items used to apply these requirements must be  determined with respect to the plan year being tested. However, Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-11(g) provides rules allowing for corrective amendments made  after the close of the plan year to be taken into account in satisfying  certain requirements under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of section 410(b) rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Relationship between  sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b). To be a qualified plan, a plan must  satisfy both sections 410(b) and 401(a)(4). Section 410(b) requires   that a plan benefit a nondiscriminatory group of employees, and section  401(a)(4) requires that the contributions or benefits provided to  employees benefiting under the plan not discriminate in favor of HCEs.  Consistent with this requirement, the definition of a plan subject to  testing under section 401(a)(4) is the same as the definition of a plan  subject to testing under section 410(b), i.e., the plan determined after  applying the mandatory disaggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c) and  the permissive aggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d). In addition,  whichever testing option is used for the plan year under Sec. 1.410(b)- 8(a) (e.g., quarterly testing) must also be used for purposes of  determining whether the plan satisfies section 401(a)(4) for the plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules for certain aggregated plans. Special rules are  set forth in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(b) for applying the nondiscriminatory  amount and availability requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of  this section to a plan that includes one or more defined benefit plans  and one or more defined contribution plans that have been permissively  aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restructuring. In certain circumstances, a plan may be  restructured on the basis of employee groups and treated as comprising  two or more plans, each of which is treated as a separate plan that must  independently satisfy sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b). Rules relating to  restructuring plans for purposes of applying the requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section are set forth in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> References to section 410(b).

In the case of a plan described in section 410(c)(1) that has not  made the election described in section 410(d) and is not subject to  section 403(b)(12)(A)(i), references in Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1 through  1.401(a)(4)-13 to satisfying section 410(b) mean satisfying section  410(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Collectively-bargained plans.

In applying the  nondiscriminatory amount requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, employee-provided contributions and benefits are tested  separately from employer-provided contributions and benefits, unless  otherwise provided. Rules for determining the amount of employer- provided benefits under a defined benefit plan that include employee  contributions not allocated to separate accounts are set forth in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-6(b), and rules for applying paragraph (b)(2) of this  section to employee contributions under such a plan are set forth in  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-6(c).

Plans  that do not provide uniform allocations may satisfy this requirement by  satisfying the general test in paragraph (c) of this section. See Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2)(ii)(B) for the exclusive tests applicable to section  401(k) plans and section 401(m) plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(A)</em> on the basis of  equivalent benefits pursuant to Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Safe harbors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The employer contributions  allocated under a defined contribution plan are nondiscriminatory in  amount for a plan year if the plan satisfies either of the safe harbors  in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. Paragraph (b)(4) of this  section provides exceptions for certain plan provisions that do not  cause a plan to fail to satisfy this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safe harbor for plans with uniform allocation formula--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. A defined contribution plan satisfies the safe harbor in  this paragraph (b)(2) for a plan year if the plan allocates all amounts  taken into account under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for the  plan year under an allocation formula that allocates to each employee  the same percentage of plan year compensation, the same dollar amount,  or the same dollar amount for each uniform unit of service (not to  exceed one week) performed by the employee during the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permitted disparity. If a plan satisfies section 401(l) in  form, differences in employees' allocations under the plan attributable  to uniform disparities permitted under Sec. 1.401(l)-2 (including  differences in disparities that are deemed uniform under Sec. 1.401(l)- 2(c)(2)) do not cause the plan to fail to satisfy this paragraph (b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor for plans with uniform points allocation formula-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A defined contribution plan (other than an ESOP)  satisfies the safe harbor in this paragraph (b)(3) for a plan year if it  satisfies both of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The plan must allocate amounts under a uniform points allocation  formula. A uniform points allocation formula defines each employee's  allocation for the plan year as the product of the total of all amounts  taken into account under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and a  fraction, the numerator of which is the employee's points for the plan  year and the denominator of which is the sum of the points of all  employees in the plan for the plan year. For this purpose, an employee's  points for a plan year equal the sum of the employee's points for age,  service, and units of plan year compensation for the plan year. Under a  uniform points allocation formula, each employee must receive the same  number of points for each year of age, the same number of points for  each year of service, and the same number of points for each unit of  plan year compensation. (See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3) regarding  service that may be taken into account as years of service.) A uniform  points allocation formula need not grant points for both age and  service, but it must grant points for at least one of them. If the  allocation formula grants points for years of service, the plan is  permitted to limit the number of years of service taken into account to  a single maximum number of years of service. A uniform points allocation  formula need not grant points for units of plan year compensation, but  if it does, the unit used must be a single dollar amount for all  employees that does not exceed $200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For the plan year, the average of the allocation rates for the  HCEs in the plan must not exceed the average of the allocation rates for  the NHCEs in the plan. For this purpose, allocation rates are determined  in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, without imputing  permitted disparity and without grouping allocation rates under  paragraphs (c)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example.

Because the average of the  allocation rates for the HCEs does not exceed the average of the  allocation rates for the NHCEs, Plan A satisfies paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B)  of this section and, thus, the safe harbor in this paragraph (b)(3) for  the 1994 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use of safe harbors not precluded by certain plan provisions-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The plan provides one or more entry dates during  the plan year as permitted by section 410(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain conditions on allocations. The plan provides that an  employee's allocation for the plan year is conditioned on either the  employee's employment on the last day of the plan year or the employee's  completion of a minimum number of hours of service during the plan year  (not to exceed 1,000), or both. Such a provision may include an  exception from this condition for all employees whose employment  terminates during the plan year or only for those employees whose  employment terminates during the plan year on account of one or more of  the following circumstances: retirement, disability, death, or military  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Certain limits on allocations. The plan limits allocations  otherwise provided under the allocation formula to a maximum dollar  amount or a maximum percentage of plan year compensation, limits the  dollar amount of plan year compensation taken into account in  determining the amount of allocations, or applies the restrictions of  section 409(n) or the limits of section 415.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Multiple formulas--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. The plan provides that an  employee's allocation under the plan is the greater of the allocations  determined under two or more formulas, or is the sum of the allocations  determined under two or more formulas.

The provisions of this  paragraph (b)(4)(vi) may be applied more than once. For example, a plan  satisfies this paragraph (b) if an employee's allocation under the plan  is the greater of the allocations under two or more formulas, and one or  more of those formulas is the sum of the allocations under two or more  other formulas, provided that each of the formulas under the plan  satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(vi) (B) through (D) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (b)(4)(vi):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Under Plan A, each employee's allocation equals the sum  of the allocations determined under two formulas. The first formula  provides an allocation of five percent of plan year compensation. The  second formula provides an allocation of $100. Plan A satisfies this  paragraph (b)(4)(vi).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Under Plan B, each employee's allocation equals the  greater of the allocations determined under two formulas. The first  formula provides an allocation of seven percent of plan year  compensation and is available to all employees who complete at least  1,000 hours of service during the plan year and who have not separated  from service as of the last day of the plan year. The second formula is  a top-heavy formula that provides an allocation of three percent of plan  year compensation and that is available to all employees described in  Sec. 1.416-1, Q&A; M-10. Plan B does not satisfy the general rule in  paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D)(1) of this section because the two formulas are  not available on the same terms to all employees (i.e., an employee is  required to complete 1,000 hours of service during the plan year to  receive an allocation under the first formula, but not under the second  formula). Nonetheless, because the second formula is a top-heavy  formula, the special availability rules for top-heavy formulas in  paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D)(3) of this section apply. Thus, the second  formula does not fail to be available on the same terms as the first  formula merely because the second formula is available to all employees  described in Sec. 1.416-1, Q&A; M-10, as long as the plan would satisfy  section 410(b) if all employees who are benefiting under the plan solely  as a result of receiving allocations under the top-heavy formula were  treated as not currently benefiting under the plan. This is true even if  the plan conditions the availability of the second formula on the plan's  being top-heavy for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that the  first formula is available to all employees who have not separated from  service as of the last day of the plan year, regardless of whether they  complete at least 1,000 hours of service during the plan year. Plan B  still does not satisfy the general rule in paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D)(1) of  this section because the two formulas are not available on the same  terms to all employees (i.e., the second formula is only available to  all non-key employees). Nonetheless, because the second formula is a  top-heavy formula, the special availability rules for top-heavy formulas  in paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D)(3) of this section apply. Thus, the second  formula does not fail to be available on the same terms as the first  formula merely because the second formula is available solely to all  non-key employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General test for nondiscrimination in amount of contributions-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The employer contributions allocated under a defined  contribution plan are nondiscriminatory in amount for a plan year if  each rate group under the plan satisfies section 410(b). For purposes of  this paragraph (c), a rate group exists under a plan for each HCE and  consists of the HCE and all other employees in the plan (both HCEs and  NHCEs) who have an allocation rate   greater than or equal to the HCE's allocation rate. Thus, an employee is  in the rate group for each HCE who has an allocation rate less than or  equal to the employee's allocation rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of allocation rates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The  allocation rate for an employee for a plan year equals the sum of the  allocations to the employee's account for the plan year, expressed  either as a percentage of plan year compensation or as a dollar amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocations taken into account. The amounts taken into account  in determining allocation rates for a plan year include all employer  contributions and forfeitures that are allocated or treated as allocated  to the account of an employee under the plan for the plan year, other  than amounts described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. For  this purpose, employer contributions include annual additions described  in Sec. 1.415(c)-1(b)(4) (regarding amounts arising from certain  transactions between the plan and the employer). In the case of a  defined contribution plan subject to section 412, an employer  contribution is taken into account in the plan year for which it is  required to be contributed and allocated to employees' accounts under  the plan, even if all or part of the required contribution is not  actually made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allocations not taken into account. Allocations of income,  expenses, gains, and losses attributable to the balance in an employee's  account are not taken into account in determining allocation rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Imputation of permitted disparity. The disparity permitted  under section 401(l) may be imputed in accordance with the rules of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Grouping of allocation rates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. An employer may  treat all employees who have allocation rates within a specified range  above and below a midpoint rate chosen by the employer as having an  allocation rate equal to the midpoint rate within that range. Allocation  rates within a given range may not be grouped under this paragraph  (c)(2)(v) if the allocation rates of HCEs within the range generally are  significantly higher than the allocation rates of NHCEs in the range.  The specified ranges within which all employees are treated as having  the same allocation rate may not overlap and may be no larger than  provided in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section. Allocation rates of  employees that are not within any of these specified ranges are  determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Size of specified ranges. The lowest and highest allocation  rates in the range must be within five percent (not five percentage  points) of the midpoint rate. If allocation rates are determined as a  percentage of plan year compensation, the lowest and highest allocation  rates need not be within five percent of the midpoint rate, if they are  no more than one quarter of a percentage point above or below the  midpoint rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Consistency requirement. Allocation rates must be determined in  a consistent manner for all employees for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Satisfaction of section 410(b) by a rate group--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General  rule. For purposes of determining whether a rate group satisfies section  410(b), the rate group is treated as if it were a separate plan that  benefits only the employees included in the rate group for the plan  year. Thus, for example, under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(4)(iv), the ratio  percentage of the rate group is determined taking into account all  nonexcludable employees regardless of whether they benefit under the  plan. Paragraph (c)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this section provide additional  special rules for determining whether a rate group satisfies section  410(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of nondiscriminatory classification test. A rate  group satisfies the nondiscriminatory classification test of Sec.  1.410(b)-4 (including the reasonable classification requirement of Sec.  1.410(b)-4(b)) if and only if the ratio percentage of the rate group is  greater than or equal to the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The midpoint between the safe and the unsafe harbor percentages  applicable to the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The ratio percentage of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of average benefit percentage test. A rate group  satisfies the average benefit percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-5 if the  plan of which it is a part satisfies Sec. 1.410(b)-5 (without regard to  Sec. 1.410(b)-5(f)). In the case of a   plan that relies on Sec. 1.410(b)-5(f) to satisfy the average benefit  percentage test, each rate group under the plan satisfies the average  benefit percentage test (if applicable) only if the rate group  separately satisfies Sec. 1.410(b)-5(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the general test in  this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer X maintains two defined contribution plans, Plan  A and Plan B, that are aggregated and treated as a single plan for  purposes of sections 410(b) and 401(a)(4) pursuant to Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(d). For the 1994 plan year, Employee M has plan year compensation of  $10,000 and receives an allocation of $200 under Plan A and an  allocation of $800 under Plan B. Employee M's allocation rate under the  aggregated plan for the 1994 plan year is 10 percent (i.e., $1,000  divided by $10,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The employees in Plan C have the following allocation  rates (expressed as a percentage of plan year compensation): 2.75  percent, 2.80 percent, 2.85 percent, 3.25 percent, 6.65 percent, 7.33  percent, 7.34 percent, and 7.35 percent. Because the first four rates  are within a range of no more than one quarter of a percentage point  above and below 3.0 percent (a midpoint rate chosen by the employer),  under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section the employer may treat the  employees who have those rates as having an allocation rate of 3.0  percent (provided that the allocation rates of HCEs within the range  generally are not significantly higher than the allocation rates of  NHCEs within the range). Because the last four rates are within a range  of no more than five percent above and below 7.0 percent (a midpoint  rate chosen by the employer), the employer may treat the employees who  have those rates as having an allocation rate of 7.0 percent (provided  that the allocation rates of HCEs within the range generally are not  significantly higher than the allocation rates of NHCEs within the  range).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer Y has only six nonexcludable employees, all  of whom benefit under Plan D.

Rate group 1 consists of  H1 and all those employees who have an allocation rate greater than or  equal to H1's allocation rate (5.0 percent).

Rate group 2 consists only of H2 because  no other employee has an allocation rate greater than or equal to H2's  allocation rate (7.5 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> of this section.

If Plan D satisfies the average  benefit percentage test, then rate group 2 satisfies section 410(b) and  thus, Plan D satisfies the general test in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, because each   rate group under the plan satisfies section 410(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan E satisfies section 410(b) by satisfying the  nondiscriminatory classification test of Sec. 1.410(b)-4 and the  average benefit percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-5 (without regard to  Sec. 1.410(b)-5(f)).

This section provides rules for  determining whether the employer-provided benefits under a defined  benefit plan are nondiscriminatory in amount as required by Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2)(iii). Certain defined benefit plans that provide  uniform benefits are permitted to satisfy this requirement by meeting  one of the safe harbors in paragraph (b) of this section. Plans that do  not provide uniform benefits may satisfy this requirement by satisfying  the general test in paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this  section provides rules for determining the individual benefit accrual  rates needed for the general test. Paragraph (e) of this section  provides rules for determining compensation for purposes of applying the  requirements of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides  additional rules that apply generally for purposes of both the safe  harbors in paragraph (b) of this section and the general test in  paragraph (c) of this section.

Each employee's benefit must be accrued over  the same years of service that are taken into account in applying the  benefit formula under the plan to that employee. For this purpose, any  year in which the employee benefits under the plan (within the meaning  of Sec. 1.410(b)-3(a)) is included as a year of service in which a  benefit accrues. Thus, for example, a plan does not satisfy the safe  harbor in paragraph (b)(4) of this section unless the plan uses the same  years of service to determine both the normal retirement benefit under  the plan's benefit formula and the fraction by which an employee's  fractional rule benefit is multiplied to derive the employee's accrued  benefit as of any plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A provides a normal retirement benefit equal to two  percent of average annual compensation times each year of service  commencing at age 65 for all employees. Plan A provides that employees  of Division S receive their benefit in the form of a straight life  annuity and that employees of Division T receive their benefit in the  form of a life annuity with an automatic cost-of-living increase. Plan A  does not provide a uniform normal retirement benefit within the meaning  of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because the annual benefit is not  payable in the same form to all employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan B provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 1.5  percent of average annual compensation times each year of service at  normal retirement age for all employees. The normal retirement age under  the plan is the earlier of age 65 or the age at which the employee  completes 10 years of service, but in no event earlier than age 62. Plan  B does not provide a uniform normal retirement benefit within the  meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because the same uniform  normal retirement age does not apply to all employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan C is an accumulation plan under which the benefit  for each year of service equals one percent of plan year compensation  payable in the same form to all employees commencing at the same uniform  normal retirement age. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an  accumulation plan may substitute plan year compensation for average  annual compensation. Plan C provides a uniform normal retirement benefit  within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, because all  employees with the same number of years of service at normal retirement  age will receive an annual benefit that is treated as the same  percentage of average annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the  benefit for each year of service equals one percent of plan year  compensation increased by reference to the increase in the cost of  living from the year of service to normal retirement age. Plan C does  not provide a uniform normal retirement benefit, because the annual  benefit defined by the benefit formula can vary for employees with the  same number of years of service at normal retirement age, depending on  the age at which those years of service were credited to the employee  under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Plan D provides a normal retirement benefit of 50 percent  of average annual compensation at normal retirement age (age 65) for  employees with 30 years of service at normal retirement age. Plan D  provides that, in the case of an employee with less than 30 years of  service at normal retirement age, the normal retirement benefit is  reduced on a pro rata basis for each year of service less than 30.  However, if an employee with less than 30 years of service at normal  retirement age continues to work past normal retirement age, Plan D  provides that the additional years of service worked past normal  retirement age are taken into account for purposes of the 30 years of  service requirement. Thus, an employee who has 26 years of service at  age 65 but who does not retire   until age 69 with 30 years of service will receive a benefit of 50  percent of average annual compensation. Plan D provides uniform post- normal retirement benefits within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)</em>- 9(c)(6), Example 2, for an example of how a plan with an early  retirement window benefit may be restructured into two component plans,  each of which satisfies the safe harbors of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A similar analysis would apply if, instead of an unreduced early  retirement benefit, the early retirement window benefit consisted of a  special schedule of early retirement factors, defined by starting with  the plan's usual schedule and then treating each employee eligible for  the early retirement window benefit as being five years older than the  employee actually is, but not older than the employee's normal  retirement age.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Plan F generally provides a normal retirement benefit of  1.5 percent of an employee's average annual compensation multiplied by  the employee's years of service with the employer. For employees  transferred outside of the group of employees covered by the plan, the  plan's benefit formula takes into account only years of service prior to  the transfer, but determines average annual compensation taking into  account section 414(s) compensation both before and after the transfer.  Plan F does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this  section with respect to transferred employees, because their benefits  are accrued over years of service (i.e., after transfer) that are not  taken into account in applying the plan's benefit formula to them.  However, see Example 2 of paragraph (b)(6)(x)(B) of this section for an  example of how a plan that continues to take transferred employees'  section 414(s) compensation into account after their transfer may still  satisfy this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe harbor for unit credit plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.

Plan A satisfies this paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Safe harbor for plans using fractional accrual rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General  rule. A plan satisfies the safe harbor in this paragraph (b)(4) for a  plan year if it satisfies each of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The plan must satisfy the fractional accrual rule of section  411(b)(1)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each employee's accrued benefit under the plan as of any plan  year before the employee reaches normal retirement age must be  determined by multiplying the employee's fractional rule benefit (within  the meaning of Sec. 1.411(b)-1(b)(3)(ii)(A)) by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the employee's years of service determined as of  the plan year, and the denominator of which is the employee's projected  years of service as of normal retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The plan must satisfy one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under the plan, it must be impossible for any employee to accrue  in a plan year a portion of the normal retirement benefit described in  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section that is more than one-third larger  than the portion of the same benefit accrued in that or any other plan  year by any other employee, when each portion of the benefit is  expressed as a percentage of each employee's average annual compensation  or as a dollar amount. In making this determination, actual and  potential employees in the plan with any amount of service at normal  retirement must be taken into account (other than employees with more  than 33 years of service at normal retirement age). In addition, in the  case of a plan that satisfies section 401(l) in form, an employee is  treated as accruing benefits at a rate equal to the excess benefit  percentage in the case of a defined benefit excess plan or at a rate  equal to the gross benefit percentage in the case of an offset plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The normal retirement benefit under the plan must be a flat  benefit that requires a minimum of 25 years of service at normal  retirement age for an employee to receive the unreduced flat benefit,  determined without regard to section 415. For this purpose, a flat  benefit is a benefit that is the same percentage of average annual  compensation or the same dollar amount for all employees who have a  minimum number of years of service at normal retirement age (e.g., 50  percent of average annual compensation), with a pro rata reduction in  the flat benefit for employees who have less than the minimum number of  years of service at normal retirement age. An employee is permitted to  accrue the maximum benefit permitted under section 415 over a period of  less than 25 years, provided that the flat benefit under the plan,  determined without regard to section 415, can accrue over no less than  25 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, normal accrual rates are determined under paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples.

Plan A provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 1.6  percent of average annual compensation times each year of service up to  25. Plan A further provides that an employee's accrued benefit as of any  plan year equals the employee's fractional rule benefit multiplied by a  fraction, the numerator of which is the employee's years of service as  of the plan year, and the denominator of which is the employee's  projected years of service as of normal retirement age. The greatest  benefit that an employee could accrue in any plan year is 1.6 percent of  average annual compensation (this is the case for an employee with 25 or  fewer years of projected service at normal retirement age). Among  potential employees with 33 or fewer years of projected service at  normal retirement age, the lowest benefit that an employee could accrue  in any plan year is 1.212 percent of average annual compensation (this  is the case for an employee with 33 years of projected service at normal  retirement age). Plan A satisfies paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C)(1) of this  section because 1.6 percent is not more than one third larger than 1.212  percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan B provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 1.0  percent of average annual compensation up to the integration level, and  1.6 percent of average annual compensation above the integration level,  times each year of service up to 35. Plan B further provides that an  employee's accrued benefit as of any plan year equals the employee's  fractional rule benefit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which  is the employee's years of service as of the plan year and the  denominator of which is the employee's projected years of service as of  normal retirement age. For purposes of satisfying the one third larger  rule in paragraph   (b)(4)(i)(C)(1) of this section, because Plan B satisfies section 401(l)  in form, all employees with less than 35 projected years of service are  assumed to accrue benefits at the rate of 1.6 percent of average annual  compensation (the excess benefit percentage under the plan). Plan B  satisfies paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section because all employees  with 33 or fewer years of projected service at normal retirement age  accrue in each plan year a benefit of 1.6 percent of average annual  compensation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan C provides a normal retirement benefit equal to four  percent of average annual compensation times each year of service up to  10 and one percent of average annual compensation times each year of  service in excess of 10 and not in excess of 30. Plan C further provides  that an employee's accrued benefit as of any plan year equals the  employee's fractional rule benefit multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the employee's years of service as of the plan  year, and the denominator of which is the employee's projected years of  service as of normal retirement age. The greatest benefit that an  employee could accrue in any plan year is four percent of average annual  compensation (this is the case for an employee with 10 or fewer years of  projected service at normal retirement age). Among employees with 33 or  fewer years of projected service at normal retirement age, the lowest  benefit that an employee could accrue in a plan year is 1.82 percent of  average annual compensation (this is the case of an employee with 33  years of projected service at normal retirement age). Plan C fails to  satisfy this paragraph (b)(4) because four percent is more than one  third larger than 1.82 percent. See also Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(c)(6),  Example 3.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Plan D provides a normal retirement benefit of 100  percent of average annual compensation, reduced by four percentage  points for each year of service below 25 the employee has at normal  retirement age. Plan D further provides that an employee's accrued  benefit as of any plan year is equal to the employee's fractional rule  benefit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  employee's years of service as of the plan year, and the denominator of  which is the employee's projected years of service at normal retirement  age. In the case of an employee who has five years of service as of the  current plan year, and who is projected to have 10 years of service at  normal retirement age, the employee's fractional rule benefit would be  40 percent of average annual compensation, and the employee's accrued  benefit as of the current plan year would be 20 percent of average  annual compensation (the fractional rule benefit multiplied by a  fraction of five years over 10 years). Plan D satisfies this paragraph  (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the  normal retirement benefit is 125 percent of average annual compensation,  reduced by five percentage points for each year of service below 25 that  the employee has at normal retirement age. Plan D satisfies this  paragraph (b)(4), even though an employee may accrue the maximum benefit  allowed under section 415 (i.e., 100 percent of the participant's  average compensation for the high three years of service) in less than  25 years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  plan determines each employee's accrued benefit by multiplying the  employee's projected normal retirement benefit (rather than the  fractional rule benefit) by the fraction described in Example 1. In  determining an employee's projected normal retirement benefit, the plan  defines each employee's average annual compensation as the average  annual compensation the employee would have at normal retirement age if  the employee's annual section 414(s) compensation in future plan years  equaled the employee's plan year compensation for the prior plan year.  Under these facts, Plan A does not satisfy paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of  this section because the employee's accrued benefit is determined on the  basis of a projected normal retirement benefit that is not the same as  the employee's fractional rule benefit determined in accordance with  Sec. 1.411(b)-1(b)(3)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Plan E provides a normal retirement benefit of 50 percent  of average annual compensation, with a pro rata reduction for employees  with less than 30 years of service at normal retirement age. Plan E  further provides that an employee's accrued benefit as of any plan year  is equal to the employee's fractional rule benefit multiplied by a  fraction, the numerator of which is the employee's years of service as  of the plan year, and the denominator of which is the employee's  projected years of service at normal retirement age. For purposes of  determining this fraction, the plan limits the years of service taken  into account for an employee to the number of years the employee has  participated in the plan. However, all years of service (including years  of service before the employee commenced participation in the plan) are  taken into account in determining an employee's normal retirement  benefit under the plan's benefit formula. Plan E fails to satisfy this  paragraph (b)(4) because the years of service over which benefits accrue  differ from the years of service used in applying the benefit formula  under the plan. See paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan F provides a normal retirement benefit equal to  2.0 percent of average annual compensation, plus 0.65 percent of average  annual compensation above covered compensation, for each year of service   up to 25.

Thus, the  benefit formula may not recognize years of service before an employee  commenced participation in the plan because, otherwise, the definition  of years of service for determining the normal retirement benefit would  differ from the definition of years of service for determining the  accrued benefit under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section. See  paragraph (b)(4)(ii), Example 7, of this section. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, an insurance contract plan adopted and in effect on September  19, 1991, may continue to recognize years of service prior to an  employee's participation in the plan for an employee who is a  participant in the plan on that date to the extent provided by the  benefit formula in the plan on such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The scheduled premium payments under an individual or group  insurance contract used to fund an employee's normal retirement benefit  must be level annual payments to normal retirement age.

The  second formula provides the minimum benefit described in section  416(c)(1) and is available to all non-key employees who complete at  least 1,000 hours of service during the plan year. Plan C does not  satisfy the general rule in paragraph (b)(6)(xi)(D)(1) of this section  because the two formulas are not available on the same terms to all  employees (i.e., the second formula is only available to all non-key  employees). Nonetheless, because the second formula is a top-heavy  formula, the special availability rules for top-heavy formulas in  paragraph (b)(6)(xi)(D)(3) of this section apply. Thus, the second  formula does not fail to be available on the same terms as the first  formula   merely because the second formula is available solely to all non-key  employees on the same terms.

In 1994, the plan is amended to provide a benefit of two  percent of average annual compensation per year of service after 1993,  while continuing to provide a benefit of one percent of average annual  compensation per year of service for all years of service before 1994.  Thus, the plan's amended benefit formula provides a benefit equal to the  sum of the benefits determined under two benefit formulas: one percent  of average annual compensation per year of service, plus one percent of  average annual compensation per year of service after 1993. Plan E  satisfies this paragraph (b)(6)(xi).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that the  plan amendment in 1994 decreases the benefit to 0.75 percent of average  annual compensation per year of service after 1993, while retaining the  one-percent formula for all years of service before 1994. Thus, the  plan's amended benefit formula provides a benefit equal to the sum of  the benefits determined under two benefit formulas: 0.75 percent of  average annual compensation per year of service, plus 0.25 percent of  average annual compensation per year of service before 1994. Under these  facts, the second formula does not separately satisfy any of the safe  harbors in this paragraph (b) because the years of service over which  each employee's benefit accrues under the second formula (i.e., all  years of service) are not the same years of service that are taken into  account in applying the benefit formula under the plan to that employee  (i.e., years of service before 1994). See paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this  section. But see paragraph (b)(6)(vii) of this section and Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-13, which provide rules under which Plan E, as amended, may  be able to satisfy this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Plan F provides a benefit to all employees of one percent  of average annual compensation per year of service. Employee M was hired  as the president of the employer in December 1994 and was not a HCE  under section 414(q) during the 1994 calendar plan year. In 1994, Plan F  is amended to provide a benefit that is the greater of the benefit  determined under the pre-existing formula in the plan and a new formula  that is available solely to some NHCEs (including Employee M). The new  formula does not satisfy the uniformity requirements of paragraph (b)(2)  of this section, because it provides a different benefit for some NHCEs  than for other NHCEs. As a result of this change, Employee M receives a  higher accrual in 1994 than the NHCEs who are not eligible for the new  formula. In 1995, when Employee M first becomes a HCE, the second  formula no longer applies to Employee M. It would be inconsistent with  the purpose of preventing discrimination in favor of HCEs for Plan F to  use the special rule for a formula that is available solely to some or  all NHCEs to satisfy the separate testing requirement of paragraph  (b)(6)(xi)(C) of this section for the 1994 calendar plan year.

Thus, an employee is in the rate group  for each HCE who has a normal accrual rate less than or equal to the  employee's normal accrual rate, and who also has a most valuable accrual  rate less than or equal to the employee's most valuable accrual rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Satisfaction of section 410(b) by a rate group.

For this purpose, five percent of the number of HCEs may be determined  by rounding to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1.4 rounds to 1 and 1.5  rounds to 2).

The normal accrual rate for an employee for a plan year is  the increase in the employee's accrued benefit (within the meaning of  section 411(a)(7)(A)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i))</em> during the measurement period, divided by the  employee's testing service during the measurement period, and expressed  either as a dollar amount or as a percentage of the employee's average  annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Most valuable accrual rate. The most valuable accrual rate for  an employee for a plan year is the increase in the employee's most  valuable optional form of payment of the accrued benefit during the  measurement period, divided by the employee's testing service during the  measurement period, and expressed either as a dollar amount or as a  percentage of the employee's average annual compensation. The employee's  most valuable optional form of payment of the accrued benefit is  determined by calculating for the employee the normalized QJSA  associated with the accrued benefit that is potentially payable in the  current or any future plan year at any age under the plan and selecting  the largest (per year of testing service). If the plan provides a QSUPP,  the most valuable accrual rate also takes into account the QSUPP payable  in conjunction with the QJSA at each age under the plan. Thus, the most  valuable accrual rate reflects the value of all benefits accrued or  treated as accrued under section 411(d)(6) that are payable in any form  and at any time under the plan, including early retirement benefits,  retirement-type subsidies, early retirement window benefits, and QSUPPs.  In addition, the most valuable accrual rate must take into account any  such benefits that are available during a plan year, even if the  benefits cease to be available before the end of the current or any  future plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Measurement period. The measurement period can be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The current plan year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The current plan year and all prior years; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The current plan year and all prior and future years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Testing service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. Testing service means an  employee's years of service as defined in the plan for purposes of  applying the benefit formula under the plan, subject to the requirements  of paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B) of this section. Alternatively, testing  service means service determined for all employees in a reasonable  manner that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B) of  this section. For example, the number of plan years that an employee has  benefited under the plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-3(a) is an  acceptable definition of testing service because it determines service  in a reasonable manner and satisfies paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B) of this  section. See also Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3) (additional limits on  service that may be taken into account as testing service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requirements for testing service--(1) Employees not credited  with years of service under the benefit formula. An employee must be  credited with testing service for any year in which the employee  benefits under the plan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-3(a)),  unless that year is part of a period of service that may not be taken  into account under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3). This rule applies even if  the employee does not receive service credit under the benefit formula  for that year (e.g., because of a service cap in the benefit formula or  because of a transfer out of the group of employees covered by the  plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Current year testing service. In the case of a measurement  period that is the current plan year, testing service for the plan year  equals one (1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules of application--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consistency requirement. Both normal  and most valuable accrual rates must be determined in a consistent  manner for all employees for the plan year. Thus, for example, the same  measurement periods must be used, and the rules of this paragraph (d)(2)  and any available options described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section  must be applied consistently. If plan benefits are not expressed   as straight life annuities beginning at employees' testing ages, they  must be normalized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determining plan benefits, service and compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. Potential plan benefits, testing service, and average annual  compensation must be determined in a reasonable manner, reflecting  actual or projected service and compensation only through the end of the  measurement period. The determination of potential plan benefits is not  reasonable if it incorporates an assumption that, in future years, an  employee's compensation will increase or the employee will terminate  employment before the employee's testing age (other than the assumptions  under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section that the employee's service  will end in connection with the payment of each potential QJSA in future  years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> as of the end of the measurement period,  they must also be taken into account as of the beginning of the  measurement period. If the limits of section 415 are not taken into  account in testing the plan for the current plan year, but were taken  into account in testing the plan for the preceding plan year, any  resulting increase in the accrued benefits taken into account in testing  the plan is treated as an increase in accrued benefits during the  current plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirements for measurement period that includes future  years--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Discriminatory pattern of accruals. A measurement period that  includes future years (as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this  section) may not be used if the pattern of accruals under the plan  discriminates in favor of HCEs (i.e., if projected benefits for HCEs are  relatively frontloaded when compared to the degree of front loading or  backloading for NHCEs). This determination is made based on all of the  relevant facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Future-period limitation. Future years beginning after an  employee's attainment of the employee's testing age (or after the  employee's assumed termination in the case of most valuable accrual  rates) may not be included in the measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Optional rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Imputation of permitted disparity. The  disparity permitted under section 401(l) may be imputed in accordance  with the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grouping of accrual rates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. An employer may  treat all employees who have accrual rates within a specified range  above and below a midpoint rate chosen by the employer as having an  accrual rate equal to the midpoint rate within that range. Accrual rates  within a given range may not be grouped under this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)  if the accrual rates of HCEs within the range generally are  significantly higher than the accrual rates of NHCEs in the range. The  specified ranges within which all employees are treated as having the  same accrual rate may not overlap and may be no larger than provided in  paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Accrual rates of employees that  are not within any of these specified ranges are determined without  regard to this paragraph (d)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Size of specified ranges. In the case of normal accrual rates,  the lowest and highest accrual rates in the range must be within five  percent (not five percentage points) of the midpoint rate. In the case  of most valuable accrual rates, the lowest and highest accrual rates in  the range must be within 15 percent (not 15 percentage points) of the  midpoint rate. If accrual rates are determined as a percentage of  average annual compensation, the lowest and highest accrual rates need  not be within five percent (or 15 percent) of the midpoint rate, if they  are no more than one twentieth of a percentage point above or below the  midpoint rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of  this section, a measurement period for a fresh-start group is permitted  to be limited to the period beginning after the fresh-start date with  respect to that group if the plan makes a fresh start that satisfies  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c) (without regard to Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(2)(i)  and (ii)). If the measurement period is so limited or the measurement  period is the plan year (whether or not so limited), any compensation  adjustments during the measurement period to the frozen accrued benefit  as of the fresh-start date that are permitted under the rules of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) may be disregarded in determining the increase in  accrued benefits during the measurement period, but only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan makes a fresh start as of the fresh-start date that  satisfies Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c) (without regard to Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 13(c)(2)(ii)) in conjunction with a bona fide amendment to the benefit  formula or accrual method under the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amendment provides for adjustments to employees' frozen  accrued benefits as of the fresh-start date in accordance with the rules  of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application of consistency requirements. Limiting the  application of the fresh-start alternative in this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)  to a fresh-start group that consists of fewer than all employees does  not violate the consistency requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Floor on most valuable accrual rate. In lieu of determining an  employee's most valuable accrual rate in accordance with the definition  in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, an employer may determine an  employee's most valuable accrual rate for the current plan year as the  employee's highest most valuable accrual rate determined for any prior  plan year. This option may be used only if the employee's normal accrual  rate has not changed significantly from the normal accrual rate for the  relevant prior plan year and, there have been no plan amendments in the  interim period since that prior plan year that affect the determination  of most valuable accrual rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The employees in Plan A have the following normal accrual  rates (expressed as percentage of average annual compensation): 0.8  percent, 0.83 percent, 0.9 percent, 1.9 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.1  percent. Because the first three rates are within a range of no more  than one twentieth of a percentage point above or below 0.85 percent (a  midpoint rate chosen by the employer), the employer may treat the  employees who have those rates as having an accrual rate of 0.85 percent  (provided that the accrual rates of HCEs within the range are not  significantly higher than the accrual rates for NHCEs within the range).  Because the last three rates are within a range of no more than five  percent above or below 2.0 percent (a midpoint rate chosen by the  employer), the employer may treat the employees who have those rates as  having an accrual rate of 2.0 percent (provided that the accrual rates  of HCEs within the range are not significantly higher than the accrual  rates for NHCEs within the range).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer X maintains a plan under which headquarters  employees accrue a benefit of 1.25 percent of average compensation for  the first 10 years of service and 0.75 percent of average compensation  for subsequent years of service, while all other employees accrue a  benefit of one percent of compensation for all years of service. Assume  that the group of headquarters employees does not satisfy section  410(b). Under these facts, the pattern of accruals under the plan  discriminates in favor of HCEs, and, therefore, under paragraph  (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the measurement period for determining  accrual rates under the plan may not include future service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Compensation rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (e) provides  rules for determining average annual compensation. Safe harbor plans  that satisfy paragraph (b) of this section must determine benefits  either as a dollar amount unrelated to employees' compensation or as a  percentage of each employee's average annual compensation. In contrast,  plans that must satisfy the general test of paragraph (c) of this  section are not required under this section to determine benefits under  any particular definition of compensation or in any particular manner,  but the accrual rates used in testing these   plans must be expressed either as a dollar amount or determined as a  percentage of each employee's average annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Average annual compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An employee's  average annual compensation is the average of the employee's annual  section 414(s) compensation determined over the averaging period in the  employee's compensation history during which the average of the  employee's annual section 414(s) compensation is the highest. For this  purpose, an averaging period must consist of three or more consecutive  12-month periods, but need not be longer than the employee's period of  employment. An employee's compensation history may begin at any time,  but must be continuous, be no shorter than the averaging period, and end  in the current plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain permitted modifications to average annual  compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use of plan year compensation. If the measurement  period for determination of accrual rates is the current plan year, or  the plan is an accumulation plan that satisfies paragraph (b) of this  section, then plan year compensation may be substituted for average  annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Drop-out years. Any of the following types of 12-month periods  in an employee's compensation history may be disregarded in determining  the employee's average annual compensation (including for purposes of  the requirement to average section 414(s) compensation over consecutive  12-month periods), but only if the plan disregards the employee's  compensation for those periods in determining benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The 12-month period in which the employee terminates employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All 12-month periods in which the employee performs no services;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All 12-month periods in which the employee performs services for  less than a specified number of hours or specified period of time in the  12-month period.

If a plan determines an  employee's average annual compensation using 12-month periods that do  not end on a fixed date (e.g., average annual compensation as of a date  is defined as the average of the employee's section 414(s) compensation  for the 60 consecutive months within the compensation history in which  the average is highest), then, for purposes of determining a 12-month  period, any of the following type of months may be disregarded  (including for purposes of the requirement to average section 414(s)  compensation over consecutive 12-month periods), but only if the plan  disregards the employee's compensation for those months in determining  benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The month in which the employee terminates employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All months in which the employee performs no services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All months in which the employee performs services for less than  a specified number of hours or specified period of time in the month.

In the case of an  employee who normally works less than full-time, the rules in paragraphs  (e)(2)(ii)(B)(3) and (e)(2)(ii)(C)(3) of this section may be applied in  relation to that employee's normal work schedule (instead of a full-  time employee's work schedule) by prorating the specified number of  hours or specified period of time, based on the employee's normal work  schedule as a fraction of a full-time schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> applies only if the plan does not take into  account whether 12-month periods of compensation   are consecutive in determining average compensation for purposes of  calculating benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consistency requirements.

The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A is a defined benefit plan. Plan A determines  benefits on the basis of the average of each employee's annual  compensation for the five consecutive plan years (or the employee's  period of employment, if shorter) during the employee's compensation  history in which the average of the employee's annual compensation is  the highest. The compensation history used for this purpose is the last  10 plan years, plus the current plan year. In determining compensation  for each plan year in the compensation history, Plan A defines  compensation using a single definition that satisfies section 414(s) as  a safe harbor definition under Sec. 1.414(s)-1(c). Plan A determines  benefits on the basis of average annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan B is a defined benefit plan. Plan B determines  benefits on the basis of the average of each employee's compensation for  the five consecutive 12-month periods (or the employee's period of  employment, if shorter) during the employee's compensation history in  which the average of the employee's annual compensation is the highest.  The compensation history used for this purpose is the 10 consecutive 12- month periods ending on the employee's termination date. In determining  the average, Plan B disregards all months in which the employee performs  services for less than 100 hours (60 percent of a full-time work  schedule of 173 hours). In the case of an employee whose normal work  schedule is less than a full-time schedule, Plan B disregards all months  in which that employee performs services for less than 60 percent of the  employee's normal work schedule. Plan B defines compensation for each  12-month period using a single definition that satisfies Sec. 1.414(s)- 1. Plan B determines benefits on the basis of average annual  compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that,  for plan years prior to 1996, the compensation for a plan year was  determined under a rate of pay definition of compensation that satisfies  section 414(s), while, for plan years after 1995, the compensation for a  plan year is determined using a definition that satisfies section 414(s)  as a safe harbor definition under Sec. 1.414(s)-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The underlying definition of compensation for each plan year in  the employee's compensation history is section 414(s) compensation,  because for each plan year the definition satisfies the requirements for  section 414(s) compensation under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12. Therefore, Plan  A determines benefits on the basis of average annual compensation, even  though the underlying definition used to measure the amount of  compensation for each plan year in an employee's compensation history is  not the same for all plan years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Plan  A determines benefits on the basis of the average of the employee's  annual section 414(s) compensation for the five consecutive 12-month  periods ending on June 30 during the employee's compensation history in  which the average is highest. An employee's compensation history begins  when the employee commences participation in the plan and ends in the  current plan year. In the case of an employee with less than five  consecutive years of plan participation as of June 30, the compensation  history is extended prior to the employee's commencement of  participation to include the five consecutive 12-month periods ending on  June 30 of the current plan year (or the employee's total period of  employment, if shorter). Plan A determines benefits on the basis of  average annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5.

Any special rule provided in this  paragraph (f) that is optional must, if used, apply uniformly to all  employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain qualified disability benefits. In general, qualified  disability benefits (within the meaning of section 411(a)(9)) are not  taken into account under this section. However, a qualified disability  benefit that results from the crediting of compensation or service for a  period of disability in the same manner as actual compensation or  service is credited under a plan's benefit formula is permitted to be  taken into account under this section as an accrued benefit upon the  employee's return to service with the employer following the period of  disability, provided that the qualified disability benefit is then  treated in the same manner as an accrued benefit for all purposes under  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Accruals after normal retirement age--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An  employee's accruals for any plan year after the plan year in which the  employee attains normal retirement age are taken into account for  purposes of this section. However, any plan provision that provides for  increases in an employee's accrued benefit solely because the employee  has delayed commencing benefits beyond the normal retirement age  applicable to the employee under the plan may be disregarded, but only  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The same uniform normal retirement age applies to all employees;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The percentage factor used to increase the employee's accrued  benefit is no greater than the largest percentage factor that could be  applied to increase actuarially the employee's accrued benefit using any  standard mortality table and any standard interest rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (f)(3). In each example, it is assumed that the plan satisfies  the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A provides a benefit of two percent of average  annual compensation per year of service for all employees. In addition,  Plan A provides an actuarial increase in an employee's accrued benefit  of six percent for each year that an employee defers commencement of  benefits beyond normal retirement age. For employees who continue in  service beyond normal retirement age, the employee's two-percent accrual  for the current plan year is offset by the six-percent actuarial  increase, as permitted under section 411(b)(1)(H)(iii)(II). For purposes  of this section, the actuarial increase (and hence the offset) may be  disregarded, and thus all employees may be treated as if they were  accruing at the rate of two percent of average annual compensation per  year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  employee's two- percent accrual for the current plan year is not offset  by the six-percent actuarial increase.

An early retirement window benefit  is disregarded for purposes of determining an employee's normal accrual  rate, even if the early retirement window benefit consists of a  temporary change in a plan's benefit formula. However, if an early  retirement window benefit consists of a temporary change in a plan's  benefit formula, the plan does not satisfy paragraph (b) of this section  during the period for which the change is effective unless the plan  satisfies paragraph (b) of this section both reflecting the temporary  change in the benefit formula and disregarding that change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effect of early retirement window benefit on most valuable  accrual rate. In determining an employee's most valuable optional form  of payment of the   accrued benefit (which is used in determining the employee's most  valuable accrual rate under paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (f)(4)(i) of this  section), an early retirement window benefit that is currently available  to the employee (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this  section) and that is not disregarded for a plan year under paragraph  (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is taken into account in that plan year  with respect to the employee's accrued benefit as of the earliest of the  employee's date of termination, the close of the early retirement  window, or the last day of that plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Effect of early retirement window benefit on average benefit  percentage test. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a  rate group under a plan that provides an early retirement window benefit  is deemed to satisfy the average benefit percentage test of Sec.  1.410(b)-5 if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All rate groups under the plan would satisfy the ratio  percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(2) if the early retirement window  benefit were disregarded; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The group of employees to whom the early retirement window  benefit is currently available (within the meaning of paragraph  (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section) satisfies section 410(b) without regard  to the average benefit percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Early retirement window benefit defined. For purposes of this  paragraph (f)(4), an early retirement window benefit is an early  retirement benefit, retirement-type subsidy, QSUPP, or other optional  form of benefit under a plan that is available, or a change in the  plan's benefit formula that is applicable, only to employees who  terminate employment within a limited period specified by the plan (not  to exceed one year) under circumstances specified by the plan. A benefit  does not fail to be described in the preceding sentence merely because  the plan contains provisions under which certain employees may receive  the benefit even though, for bona fide business reasons, they terminate  employment within a reasonable period after the end of the limited  period. An amendment to an early retirement window benefit that merely  extends the periods in the preceding sentences is not treated as a  separate early retirement window benefit, provided that the periods, as  extended, satisfy the preceding sentences. However, any other amendment  to an early retirement window benefit creates a separate early  retirement window benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (f)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan A provides a benefit of one percent of average  annual compensation per year of service and satisfies the requirements  of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Thus, the plan provides the same  benefit to all employees with the same years of service under the Plan.  Plan A is amended to treat all employees with ten or more years of  service who terminate employment after attainment of age 55 and between  March 1, 1999, and January 31, 2000, as if they had an additional five  years of service under the benefit formula. However, in order to ensure  the orderly implementation of the early retirement window, the plan  amendment provides that designated employees in the human resources  department who would otherwise be eligible for the early retirement  window benefit are eligible to be treated as having the additional five  years of service only if they terminate between January 1, 2000, and  April 30, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> into two component plans: Component Plan A1, consisting  of all   employees who are not eligible for the early retirement window benefit  and all of their accruals and benefits, rights, and features under the  plan, and Component Plan A2, consisting of all employees who are  eligible for the early retirement window benefit (including the  designated employees in the human resource department) and all of their  accruals and benefits, rights, and features under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Component Plan A1 still satisfies paragraph (b) of this section,  because there has been no change for the employees in that component  plan. Similarly, Component Plan A2 satisfies paragraph (b) of this  section disregarding the change in the benefit formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Because the early retirement window benefit consists of a  temporary change in the benefit formula, paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this  section requires that the plan satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)  of this section reflecting the change in order to remain a safe harbor  plan. After reflecting the change, Component Plan A2 still provides the  same benefit (albeit higher than under the regular benefit formula) to  all employees with the same years of service that may be taken into  account in testing the plan, and thus the benefit formula (as  temporarily amended) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) (i)  and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Since Component Plan A2 also satisfies all of the other  requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the safe harbor of  paragraph (b)(3) of this section reflecting the change in the benefit  formula, Component Plan A2 satisfies this paragraph (b) both reflecting  and disregarding the change in the benefit formula. Thus, Component Plan  A2 satisfies paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Plan  A's benefit formula used the maximum amount of permitted disparity under  section 401(l) prior to the amendment. The analysis is the same as in  paragraphs (a) through the first sentence of paragraph (e) of Example 1.  In order to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, a plan that uses permitted disparity must satisfy the  requirements of section 401(l) after reflecting the change in the  benefit formula. Because, as stated in Example 1, the additional five  years of service may not be taken into account for purposes of  satisfying paragraph (b) of this section, the disparity that results  from crediting that service exceeds the maximum permitted disparity  under section 401(l). Thus, Component Plan A2 does not satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Plan  A is tested under the general test in paragraph (c) of this section. The  early retirement window benefit is disregarded for purposes of  determining the normal accrual rates, but is taken into account in 1999  for purposes of determining the most valuable accrual rates, of  employees who were eligible for the early retirement window benefit  (regardless of whether they elected to receive it). As stated in Example  1, the additional five years of service do not represent past service,  pre-participation service, or imputed service, and thus under Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(i)(A) may not be taken into account as testing  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unpredictable contingent event benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. In  general, an unpredictable contingent event benefit (within the meaning  of section 412(l)(7)(B)(ii)) is not taken into account under this  section until the occurrence of the contingent event. Thus, the special  rule in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(d)(7) (treating the contingent event as  having occurred) does not apply for purposes of this section. In the  case of an unpredictable contingent event that is expected to result in  the termination from employment of certain employees within a period of  time consistent with the rules for defining an early retirement window  benefit in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, the unpredictable  contingent event benefit available to those employees is permitted to be  treated as an early retirement window benefit, thus permitting the rules  of paragraph (f)(4) of this section to be applied to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  paragraph (f)(5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer X operates various manufacturing plants and  maintains Plan A, a defined benefit plan that covers all of its  nonexcludable employees. Plan A provides an early retirement benefit  under which employees who retire after age 55 but before normal  retirement age and who have at least 10 years of service receive a  benefit equal to their normal retirement benefit reduced by four percent  per year for each year prior to normal retirement age. Plan A also  provides a plant-closing benefit under which employees who satisfy the  conditions for receiving the early retirement benefit and who work at a  plant where operations have ceased and whose employment has been  terminated will receive an unreduced normal retirement benefit. The  plant-closing benefit is an unpredictable contingent event benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> During the 1998 plan year, Employer X begins to close one plant.  Employees M through Z, who are employees at the plant that is closing,  are expected to terminate employment with Employer X during the plan  year and will satisfy the conditions for the plant-closing benefit.  Therefore, in testing Plan A under this section for the 1998 plan year,  the availability of the plant-closing benefit to Employees M through Z  must be taken into account in determining their accrual rates or in  determining whether the plan satisfies one of the safe harbors under  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Because the employees eligible for the unpredictable contingent  event benefit are expected to terminate employment with Employer X  during a period consistent with the rules for defining an early  retirement window benefit, in testing Plan A under this section for the  1998 plan year, the special rules in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this  section may be applied. Thus, for example, normal accrual rates may be  determined without reference to the unpredictable contingent event  benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Despite the closing of the plant, Employee Q remains an employee  into the 1999 plan year. Under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section,  the availability of the plant-closing benefit to Employee Q may be  disregarded in the 1999 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Determination of benefits on other than plan-year basis. For  purposes of this section, accruals are generally determined based on the  plan year. Nevertheless, an employer may determine accruals on the basis  of any period ending within the plan year as long as the period is at  least 12 months in duration. For example, accruals for all employees may  be determined based on accrual computation periods ending within the  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em>, actuarial equivalence  must be determined in a uniform manner for all employees using  reasonable actuarial assumptions. A standard interest rate and a  standard mortality table are among the assumptions considered reasonable  for this purpose. Thus, for example, if an employee has commenced  receipt of benefits in accordance with the minimum distribution  requirements of section 401(a)(9), and the plan reduces the employee's  accrued benefit to take into account the amount of the distributions,  the employee's accrued benefit for purposes of this section is restored  to the value it would have had if the distributions had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em>  applies only if the QPSA charges apply uniformly to all employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Disregard of certain offsets--(i) General rule. For purposes of  this section, an employee's accrued benefit under a plan includes that  portion of the benefit that is offset under an offset provision  described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(i)(D). The rule in the preceding  sentence applies only to the extent that the benefit by which the  benefit under the plan being tested is offset is attributable to periods  for which the plan being tested credits pre-participation service  (within the meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(ii)(A)) that satisfies  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(iii) or past service (within the meaning of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B))</em>, and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The benefit under the plan being tested is offset by either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Benefits under a qualified defined benefit plan or defined  contribution plan (whether or not terminated); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Benefits under a foreign plan that are reasonably expected to be  paid; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If any portion of the benefit that is offset is nonforfeitable  (within the meaning of section 411), that portion is offset by a benefit  (or portion of a benefit) that is also nonforfeitable (or vested, in the  case of a foreign plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (f)(9):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(iii)</em>. Plan B offsets the benefits  determined under Plan B by the employee's vested benefits under Plan A.  Plan A does not credit additional benefit service or accrual service  after employees transfer to Plan B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Plan B provision providing for an offset of benefits under  Plan A satisfies Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(i)(D). This is because the  provision applies to similarly-situated employees and the benefits under  Plan A that are offset against the Plan B benefits are attributable to  pre-participation service taken into account under Plan B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> This paragraph (f)(9) applies in determining the benefits that  are taken into account under this section for employees in Plan B who  are transferred from Plan A. This is because the offset provision is  described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(i)(D), the benefits under the  other plan by which the benefits under the plan being tested are offset  are attributable solely to pre-participation service that satisfies  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3)(iii), and the benefits are offset solely by  vested benefits under another qualified plan. Thus, for example, the  accrual rates of employees in Plan B are determined as if there were no  offset, i.e., by adding back the benefits that are offset to the net  benefits under Plan B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The result would be the same even if Plan A continued to  recognize compensation paid after the transfer in the determination of  benefits under Plan A. However, if Plan A continued to credit benefit or  accrual service after the transfer, then, to the extent that Plan B's  offset of benefits under Plan A increased as a result, the additional  benefits offset under Plan B would not be added back in determining the  benefits under Plan B that are taken into account under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Plan  A is not a plan described in paragraph (f)(9)(i)(A) of this section.  None of the benefits under Plan B that are offset by benefits under Plan  A may be added back in determining the benefits under Plan B that are  taken into account under this section. Thus, benefits under Plan B are  tested on a net basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Special rule for multiemployer plans. For purposes of this  section, if a multiemployer plan increases benefits for service prior to  a specific date subject to a plan provision requiring employees to  complete a specified amount of service (not to exceed five years) after  that date, then benefits are permitted to be determined disregarding the  service condition, provided that the condition is applicable to all  employees in the multiemployer plan (including collectively bargained  employees).  [T.D. 8485, 58 FR 46785, Sept. 3, 1993]    Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4  Nondiscriminatory availability of benefits,  rights, and features.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. This section provides rules for determining  whether the benefits, rights, and features provided under a plan (i.e.,  all optional forms of benefit, ancillary benefits, and other rights and  features available to any employee under the plan) are made available in  a nondiscriminatory manner. Benefits, rights, and features provided  under a plan are made available to employees in a nondiscriminatory  manner only if each benefit, right, or feature satisfies the current  availability requirement of paragraph (b) of this section and the  effective availability requirement of paragraph (c) of this section.  Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for applying these  requirements. Paragraph (e) of this section defines optional form of  benefit, ancillary benefit, and other right or feature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Current availability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The current availability  requirement of this paragraph (b) is satisfied if the group of employees  to whom a benefit, right, or feature is currently available during the  plan year satisfies section 410(b) (without regard to the average  benefit percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-5). In determining whether the  group of employees satisfies section 410(b), an employee is treated as  benefiting only if the benefit, right, or feature is currently available  to the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of current availability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Whether  a benefit, right, or feature that is subject to specified eligibility  conditions is currently available to an employee generally is determined  based on the current facts and circumstances with respect to the  employee (e.g., current   compensation, accrued benefit, position, or net worth).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain conditions disregarded--(A) Certain age and service  conditions--(1) General rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of  this section, any specified age or service condition with respect to an  optional form of benefit or a social security supplement is disregarded  in determining whether the optional form of benefit or the social  security supplement is currently available to an employee. Thus, for  example, an optional form of benefit that is available to all employees  who terminate employment on or after age 55 with at least 10 years of  service is treated as currently available to an employee, without regard  to the employee's current age or years of service, and without regard to  whether the employee could potentially meet the age and service  conditions prior to attaining the plan's normal retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section, an age or  service condition is not disregarded in determining the current  availability of an optional form of benefit or social security  supplement if the condition must be satisfied within a limited period of  time. However, in determining the current availability of an optional  form of benefit or a social security supplement subject to such an age  or service condition, the age and service of employees may be projected  to the last date by which the age condition or service condition must be  satisfied in order to be eligible for the optional form of benefit or  social security supplement under the plan. Thus, for example, an  optional form of benefit that is available only to employees who  terminate employment between July 1, 1995, and December 31, 1995, after  attainment of age 55 with at least 10 years of service is treated as  currently available to an employee only if the employee could satisfy  those age and service conditions by December 31, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain other conditions. Specified conditions on the  availability of a benefit, right, or feature requiring a specified  percentage of the employee's accrued benefit to be nonforfeitable,  termination of employment, death, satisfaction of a specified health  condition (or failure to meet such condition), disability, hardship,  family status, default on a plan loan secured by a participant's account  balance, execution of a covenant not to compete, application for  benefits or similar ministerial or mechanical acts, election of a  benefit form, execution of a waiver of rights under the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act or other federal or state law, or  absence from service, are disregarded in determining the employees to  whom the benefit, right, or feature is currently available. In addition,  if a multiemployer plan includes a reasonable condition that limits  eligibility for an ancillary benefit, or other right or feature, to  those employees who have recent service under the plan (e.g., a  condition on a death benefit that requires an employee to have a minimum  number of hours credited during the last two years) and the condition  applies to all employees in the multiemployer plan (including the  collectively bargained employees) to whom the ancillary benefit, or  other right or feature, is otherwise currently available, then the  condition is disregarded in determining the employees to whom the  ancillary benefit, or other right or feature, is currently available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Certain conditions relating to mandatory cash-outs. In the case  of a plan that provides for mandatory cash-outs of all terminated  employees who have a vested accrued benefit with an actuarial present  value less than or equal to a specified dollar amount (not to exceed the  cash-out limit in effect under Sec. 1.411(a)-11(c)(3)(ii)) as permitted  by sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e), the implicit condition on any  benefit, right, or feature (other than the mandatory cash-out) that  requires the employee to have a vested accrued benefit with an actuarial  present value in excess of the specified dollar amount is disregarded in  determining the employees to whom the benefit, right, or feature is  currently available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other dollar limits. A condition that the amount of an  employee's vested accrued benefit or the actuarial present value of that  benefit be less than or equal to a specified dollar amount is  disregarded in determining   the employees to whom the benefit, right, or feature is currently  available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Certain conditions on plan loans. In the case of an employee's  right to a loan from the plan, the condition that an employee must have  an account balance sufficient to be eligible to receive a minimum loan  amount specified in the plan (not to exceed $1,000) is disregarded in  determining the employees to whom the right is currently available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Benefits, rights, and features that are eliminated  prospectively--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special testing rule. Notwithstanding paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, a benefit, right, or feature that is eliminated  with respect to benefits accrued after the later of the eliminating  amendment's adoption or effective date (the elimination date), but is  retained with respect to benefits accrued as of the elimination date,  and that satisfies this paragraph (b) as of the elimination date, is  treated as satisfying this paragraph (b) for all subsequent periods.  This rule does not apply if the terms of the benefit, right, or feature  (including the employees to whom it is available) are changed after the  elimination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Elimination of a benefit, right, or feature--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule.  For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a benefit, right, or feature  provided to an employee is eliminated with respect to benefits accrued  after the elimination date if the amount or value of the benefit, right,  or feature depends solely on the amount of the employee's accrued  benefit (within the meaning of section 411(a)(7)) as of the elimination  date, including subsequent income, expenses, gains, and losses with  respect to that benefit in the case of a defined contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for benefits, rights, and features that are not  section 411(d)(6)-protected benefits. Notwithstanding paragraph  (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, in the case of a benefit, right, or  feature under a defined contribution plan that is not a section  411(d)(6)-protected benefit (within the meaning of Sec. 1.411(d)-4,  Q&A-1;), e.g., the availability of plan loans, for purposes of this  paragraph (b)(3)(ii) each employee's accrued benefit as of the  elimination date may be treated, on a uniform basis, as consisting  exclusively of the dollar amount of the employee's account balance as of  the elimination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Special rule for benefits, rights, and features that depend on  adjusted accrued benefits. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a  benefit, right, or feature provided to an employee under a plan that has  made a fresh start does not fail to be eliminated as of an elimination  date that is the fresh-start date merely because it depends solely on  the amount of the employee's adjusted accrued benefit (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective availability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Based on all of the  relevant facts and circumstances, the group of employees to whom a  benefit, right, or feature is effectively available must not  substantially favor HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer X maintains Plan A, a defined benefit plan that  covers both of its highly compensated nonexcludable employees and nine  of its 12 nonhighly compensated nonexcludable employees. Plan A provides  for a normal retirement benefit payable as an annuity and based on a  normal retirement age of 65, and an early retirement benefit payable  upon termination in the form of an annuity to employees who terminate  from service with the employer on or after age 55 with 30 or more years  of service. Both HCEs of Employer X currently meet the age and service  requirement, or will have 30 years of service by the time they reach age  55. All but two of the nine NHCEs of Employer X who are covered by Plan  A were hired on or after age 35 and, thus, cannot qualify for the early  retirement benefit. Even though the group of employees to whom the early  retirement benefit is currently available satisfies the ratio percentage  test of Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(2) when age and service are disregarded  pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, absent other facts,  the group of employees to whom the early retirement benefit is  effectively available substantially favors HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer Y maintains Plan B, a defined benefit plan that  provides for a normal retirement benefit payable as an annuity and based  on a normal retirement age of 65. By a plan amendment first adopted and  effective December 1, 1998, Employer Y amends Plan B to provide an early  retirement benefit that is available only to employees who terminate  employment by December 15, 1998, and who are at least age 55 with 30 or  more years of service. Assume   that all employees were hired prior to attaining age 25 and that the  group of employees who have, or will have, attained age 55 with 30 years  of service by December 15, 1998, satisfies the ratio percentage test of  Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(2). Assume, further, that the employer takes no  steps to inform all eligible employees of the early retirement option on  a timely basis and that the only employees who terminate from employment  with the employer during the two-week period in which the early  retirement benefit is available are HCEs. Under these facts, the group  of employees to whom this early retirement window benefit is effectively  available substantially favors HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employer Z amends Plan C on June 30, 1999, to provide for  a single sum optional form of benefit for employees who terminate from  employment with Employer Z after June 30, 1999, and before January 1,  2000. The availability of this single sum optional form of benefit is  conditioned on the employee's having a particular disability at the time  of termination of employment. The only employee of the employer who  meets this disability requirement at the time of the amendment and  thereafter through December 31, 1999, is a HCE. Under paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the disability condition is disregarded  in determining the current availability of the single sum optional form  of benefit. Nevertheless, under these facts, the group of employees to  whom the single sum optional form of benefit is effectively available  substantially favors HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mergers and acquisitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special testing  rule. A benefit, right, or feature available under a plan solely to an  acquired group of employees is treated as satisfying paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section during the period that each of the following  requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The benefit, right, or feature must satisfy paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section (determined without regard to the special rule in  section 410(b)(6)(C)) on the date that is selected by the employer as  the latest date by which an employee must be hired or transferred into  the acquired trade or business for an employee to be included in the  acquired group of employees. This determination is made with reference  to the plan of the current employer and its nonexcludable employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The benefit, right, or feature must be available under the plan  of the current employer after the transaction on the same terms as it  was available under the plan of the prior employer before the  transaction. This requirement is not violated merely because of a change  made to the benefit, right, or feature that is permitted by section  411(d)(6), provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The change is a replacement of the benefit, right, or feature  with another benefit, right, or feature that is available to the same  employees as the original benefit, right, or feature, and the original  benefit, right, or feature is of inherently equal or greater value  (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section) than the  benefit, right, or feature that replaces it; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The change is made before January 12, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Scope of special testing rule. This paragraph (d)(1) applies  only to benefits, rights, and features with respect to benefits accruing  under the plan of the current employer, and not to benefits, rights, and  features with respect to benefits accrued under the plan of the prior  employer (unless, pursuant to the transaction, the plan of the prior  employer becomes the plan of the current employer, or the assets and  liabilities with respect to the acquired group of employees under the  plan of the prior employer are transferred to the plan of the current  employer in a plan merger, consolidation, or other transfer described in  section 414(l)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  paragraph (d)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example. Employer X maintains Plan A, a defined benefit plan with a  single sum optional form of benefit for all employees. Employer Y  acquires Employer X and merges Plan A into Plan B, a defined benefit  plan maintained by Employer Y that does not otherwise provide a single  sum optional form of benefit. Employer Y continues to provide the single  sum optional form of benefit under Plan B on the same terms as it was  offered under Plan A to all employees who were acquired in the  transaction with Employer X (and to no other employees). The optional  form of benefit satisfies paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section  immediately following the transaction (determined without taking into  account section 410(b)(6)(C)) when tested with reference to Plan B and  Employer Y's nonexcludable employees. Under these facts, Plan B is  treated as satisfying this section with respect to the single sum  optional form   of benefit for the plan year of the transaction and all subsequent plan  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Frozen participants. A plan must satisfy the nondiscriminatory  availability requirement of this section not only with respect to  benefits, rights, and features provided to employees who are currently  benefiting under the plan, but also separately with respect to benefits,  rights, and features provided to nonexcludable employees with accrued  benefits who are not currently benefiting under the plan (frozen  participants). Thus, each benefit, right, and feature available to any  frozen participant under the plan is separately subject to the  requirements of this section. A plan satisfies paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section with respect to a benefit, right, or feature available to  any frozen participant under the plan only if one or more of the  following requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The benefit, right, or feature must be one that would satisfy  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if it were not available to any  employee currently benefiting under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The benefit, right, or feature must be one that would satisfy  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if all frozen participants were  treated as employees currently benefiting under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No change in the availability of the benefit, right, or  feature may have been made that is first effective in the current plan  year with respect to a frozen participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any change in the availability of the benefit, right, or  feature that is first effective in the current plan year with respect to  a frozen participant must be made in a nondiscriminatory manner. Thus,  any expansion in the availability of the benefit, right, or feature to  any highly compensated frozen participant must be applied on a  consistent basis to all nonhighly compensated frozen participants.  Similarly, any contraction in the availability of the benefit, right, or  feature that affects any nonhighly compensated frozen participant must  be applied on a consistent basis to all highly compensated frozen  participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Early retirement window benefits. If a benefit, right, or  feature meets the definition of an early retirement window benefit in  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(f)(4)(iii) (or would meet that definition if the  definition applied to all benefits, rights, and features), the benefit,  right, or feature is disregarded for purposes of applying this section  with respect to an employee for all plan years other than the first plan  year in which the benefit is currently available to the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Permissive aggregation of certain benefits, rights, or  features--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An optional form of benefit, ancillary  benefit, or other right or feature may be aggregated with another  optional form of benefit, ancillary benefit, or other right or feature,  respectively, and the two may be treated as a single optional form of  benefit, ancillary benefit, or other right or feature, if both of the  following requirements are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> One of the two optional forms of benefit, ancillary benefit, or  other rights or features must in all cases be of inherently equal or  greater value than the other. For this purpose, one benefit, right, or  feature is of inherently equal or greater value than another benefit,  right, or feature only if, at any time and under any conditions, it is  impossible for any employee to receive a smaller amount or a less  valuable right under the first benefit, right, or feature than under the  second benefit, right, or feature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The optional form of benefit, ancillary benefit, or other right  or feature of inherently equal or greater value must separately satisfy  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section (without regard to this paragraph  (d)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation may be applied more than once. The aggregation rule  in this paragraph (d)(4) may be applied more than once. Thus, for  example, an optional form of benefit may be aggregated with another  optional form of benefit that itself constitutes two separate optional  forms of benefit that are aggregated and treated as a single optional  form of benefit under this paragraph (d)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (d)(4):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A is a defined benefit plan that provides a single  sum optional form of benefit to all employees. The single sum optional  form of benefit is available on the   same terms to all employees, except that, for employees in Division S, a  five-percent discount factor is applied and, for employees of Division  T, a seven-percent discount factor is applied. Under paragraph (e)(1) of  this section, the single sum optional form of benefit constitutes two  separate optional forms of benefit. Assume that the single sum optional  form of benefit available to employees of Division S separately  satisfies paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section without taking into  account this paragraph (d)(4). Because a lower discount factor is  applied in determining the single sum optional form of benefit available  to employees of Division S than is applied in determining the single sum  optional form of benefit available to employees of Division T, the first  single sum optional form of benefit is of inherently greater value than  the second single sum optional form of benefit. Under these facts, these  two single sum optional forms of benefit may be aggregated and treated  as a single optional form of benefit for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, in  order to receive the single sum optional form of benefit, employees of  Division S (but not employees of Division T) must have completed at  least 20 years of service. The single sum optional form of benefit  available to employees of Division S is not of inherently equal or  greater value than the single sum optional form of benefit available to  employees of Division T, because an employee of Division S who  terminates employment with less than 20 years of service would receive a  smaller single sum amount (i.e., zero) than a similarly-situated  employee of Division T who terminates employment with less than 20 years  of service. Under these facts, the two single sum optional forms of  benefit may not be aggregated and treated as a single optional form of  benefit for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>,  a qualified joint and survivor annuity, qualified preretirement survivor  annuity, or spousal death benefit is deemed to be nonsubsidized if it is  provided under a defined contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special ESOP rules. An ESOP does not fail to satisfy paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this section merely because it makes an investment  diversification right or feature or a distribution option available  solely to all qualified participants (within the meaning of section  401(a)(28)(B)(iii)), or merely because the restrictions of section  409(n) apply to certain individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)(B)(ii))</em> is tested under this section as if the event  had occurred. Thus, the current availability of a benefit that becomes  an optional form of benefit upon the occurrence of an unpredictable  contingent event is tested by deeming the event to have occurred and by  disregarding age and service conditions on the eligibility for that  benefit to the extent permitted for optional forms of benefit under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Optional form of benefit--(i) General rule. The  term optional form of benefit means a distribution alternative  (including the normal form of benefit) that is available under a plan  with respect to benefits described in section 411(d)(6)(A) or a  distribution alternative that is an early retirement benefit or  retirement-type subsidy described in section 411(d)(6)(B)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, including  a QSUPP. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section,  different optional forms of benefit exist if a distribution alternative  is not payable on substantially the same terms as another distribution  alternative. The relevant terms include all terms affecting the value of  the optional form, such as the method of benefit calculation and the  actuarial assumptions used to determine the amount distributed. Thus,  for example, different optional forms of benefit may result from  differences in terms relating to the payment schedule, timing,  commencement, medium of distribution (e.g., in cash or in kind),  election   rights, differences in eligibility requirements, or the portion of the  benefit to which the distribution alternative applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Differences in benefit formula or accrual  method. A distribution alternative available under a defined benefit  plan does not fail to be a single optional form of benefit merely  because the benefit formulas, accrual methods, or other factors  (including service-computation methods and definitions of compensation)  underlying, or the manner in which employees vest in, the accrued  benefit that is paid in the form of the distribution alternative are  different for different employees to whom the distribution alternative  is available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, differences in the normal  retirement ages of employees or in the form in which the accrued benefit  of employees is payable at normal retirement age under a plan are taken  into account in determining whether a distribution alternative  constitutes one or more optional forms of benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Differences in allocation formula. A distribution alternative  available under a defined contribution plan does not fail to be a single  optional form of benefit merely because the allocation formula or other  factors (including service-computation methods, definitions of  compensation, and the manner in which amounts described in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(iii) are allocated) underlying, or the manner in  which employees vest in, the accrued benefit that is paid in the form of  the distribution alternative are different for different employees to  whom the distribution alternative is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Distributions subject to section 417(e). A distribution  alternative available under a defined benefit plan does not fail to be a  single optional form of benefit merely because, in determining the  amount of a distribution, the plan applies a lower interest rate to  determine the distribution for employees with a vested accrued benefit  having an actuarial present value not in excess of $25,000, as required  by section 417(e)(3) and Sec. 1.417(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Differences attributable to uniform normal retirement age. A  distribution alternative available under a defined benefit plan does not  fail to be a single optional form of benefit, to the extent that the  differences are attributable to differences in normal retirement dates  among employees, provided that the differences do not prevent the  employees from having the same uniform normal retirement age under the  definition of uniform normal retirement age in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (e)(1):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A is a defined benefit plan that benefits all  employees of Divisions S and T. The plan offers a qualified joint and  50-percent survivor annuity at normal retirement age, calculated by  multiplying an employee's single life annuity payment by a factor. For  an employee of Division S whose benefit commences at age 65, the plan  provides a factor of 0.90, but for a similarly-situated employee of  Division T the plan provides a factor of 0.85. The qualified joint and  survivor annuity is not available to employees of Divisions S and T on  substantially the same terms, and thus it constitutes two separate  optional forms of benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan B is a defined benefit plan that benefits all  employees of Divisions U and V. The plan offers a single sum  distribution alternative available on the same terms and determined  using the same actuarial assumptions, to all employees. However,  different benefit formulas apply to employees of each division. Under  the exception provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the  single sum optional form of benefit available to employees of Division U  is not a separate optional form of benefit from the single sum optional  form of benefit available to employees of Division V.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Defined benefit Plan C provides an early retirement  benefit based on a schedule of early retirement factors that is a single  optional form of benefit. Plan C is amended to provide an early  retirement window benefit that consists of a temporary change in the  plan's benefit formula (e.g., the addition of five years of service to  an employee's actual service under the benefit formula) applicable in  determining the benefits for certain employees who terminate employment  within a limited period of time. Under the exception provided in  paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the early retirement optional  form of benefit available to window-eligible employees is not a separate  optional form of benefit from the early retirement optional form of  benefit available to the other employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ancillary benefit. The term ancillary benefit means social  security supplements (other than QSUPPs), disability benefits not in  excess of a qualified disability benefit described in section 411(a)(9),  ancillary life insurance and health insurance benefits, death benefits  under a defined contribution plan, preretirement death benefits under a  defined benefit plan, shut-down benefits not protected under section  411(d)(6), and other similar benefits. Different ancillary benefits  exist if an ancillary benefit is not available on substantially the same  terms as another ancillary benefit. Principles similar to those in  paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section apply in making this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other right or feature--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The term other right  or feature generally means any right or feature applicable to employees  under the plan. Different rights or features exist if a right or feature  is not available on substantially the same terms as another right or  feature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions to definition of other right or feature.  Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, a right or feature  is not considered an other right or feature if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is an optional form of benefit or an ancillary benefit under the  plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is one of the terms that are taken into account in determining  whether separate optional forms of benefit or ancillary benefits exist,  or that would be taken into account but for paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this  section (e.g., benefit formulas or the manner in which benefits vest);  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Cannot reasonably be expected to be of meaningful value to an  employee (e.g., administrative details).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples.

This paragraph (a) provides rules  for determining whether the timing of a plan amendment or series of  amendments has the effect of discriminating significantly in favor of  HCEs or former HCEs. For purposes of this section, a plan amendment  includes, for example, the establishment or termination of the plan, and  any change in the benefits, rights, or features, benefit formulas, or  allocation formulas under the plan. Paragraph (b) of this section sets  forth additional requirements that must be satisfied in the case of a  plan termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Facts-and-circumstances determination. Whether the timing of a  plan amendment or series of plan amendments has the effect of  discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs or former HCEs is  determined at the time the plan amendment first becomes effective for  purposes of section 401(a), based on all of the relevant facts and  circumstances. These include, for example, the relative numbers of  current and former HCEs and NHCEs affected by the plan amendment, the  relative length of service of current and former HCEs and NHCEs, the  length of time the plan or plan provision being amended has been in  effect, and the turnover of employees prior to the plan amendment. In  addition, the relevant facts and circumstances include the relative  accrued benefits of current and former HCEs and NHCEs before and after  the plan amendment and any additional benefits provided to current and  former HCEs and NHCEs under other plans (including plans of other  employers, if relevant). In the case of a plan amendment that provides  additional benefits based on an employee's service prior to the  amendment, the relevant facts and circumstances also include the  benefits that employees and former employees who do not benefit under  the amendment would have received had the plan, as amended, been in  effect throughout the period on which the additional benefits are based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)(B))</em>. However, this safe harbor is not available if the plan  amendment granting the service credit (or increasing benefits) is part  of a pattern of amendments that has the effect of discriminating  significantly in favor of HCEs or former HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A is a defined benefit plan that covered both HCEs  and NHCEs for most of its existence. The employer decides to wind up its  business. In the process of ceasing operations, but at a time when the  plan covers only HCEs, Plan A is amended to increase benefits and  thereafter is terminated. The timing of this plan amendment has the  effect of discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan B is a defined benefit plan that provides a social  security supplement that is not a QSUPP. After substantially all of the  HCEs of the employer have benefited from the supplement, but before a  substantial number of NHCEs have become eligible for the supplement,  Plan B is amended to reduce significantly the amount of the supplement.  The timing of this plan amendment has the effect of discriminating  significantly in favor of HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan C is a defined benefit plan that contains an  ancillary life insurance benefit available to all employees. The plan is  amended to eliminate this benefit at a time when life insurance payments  have been made only to beneficiaries of HCEs. Because all employees  received the benefit of life insurance coverage before Plan C was  amended, the timing of this plan amendment does not have the effect of  discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs or former HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Plan D provides for a benefit of one percent of average  annual compensation per year of service. Ten years after Plan D is  adopted, it is amended to provide a benefit of two percent of average  annual compensation per year of service, including years of service  prior to the amendment. The amendment is effective only for employees  currently employed at the time of the amendment. The ratio of HCEs to  former HCEs is significantly higher than the ratio of NHCEs to former  NHCEs. In the absence of any additional factors, the timing of this plan  amendment has the effect of discriminating significantly in favor of  HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that, in  addition, the years of prior service are equivalent between HCEs and  NHCEs who are current employees, and the group of current employees with  prior service would satisfy the nondiscriminatory classification test of  Sec. 1.410(b)-4 in the current and all prior plan years for which past  service credit is granted. The timing of this plan amendment does not  have the effect of discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs or  former HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Employer V maintains Plan E, an accumulation plan. In  1994, Employer V amends Plan E to provide that the compensation used to  determine an employee's benefit for all preceding plan years shall not  be less than the employee's average annual compensation as of the close  of the 1994 plan year. The years of service and percentage increases in  compensation for HCEs are reasonably comparable to those of NHCEs. In  addition, the ratio of HCEs to former HCEs is reasonably comparable to  the ratio of NHCEs to former NHCEs. The timing of this plan amendment  does not have the effect of discriminating significantly in favor of  HCEs or former HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Employer W currently has six nonexcludable employees, two  of whom, H1 and H2, are HCEs, and the remaining four of whom, N1 through  N4, are NHCEs. The ratio of HCEs to former HCEs is significantly higher  than the ratio of NHCEs to former NHCEs. Employer W establishes Plan F,  a defined benefit plan providing a benefit of one percent of average  annual compensation per year of service, including years of service  prior to the establishment of the plan. H1 and H2 each have 15 years of  prior service, N1 has nine years of past service, N2 has five years, N3  has three years, and N4 has one year. The timing of this plan  establishment has the effect of discriminating significantly in favor of  HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except that N1  through N4 were hired in the current year, and Employer W never employed  any NHCEs prior to the current year. Thus, no NHCEs would have received  additional benefits had Plan F been in existence during the preceding 15  years. The timing of this plan establishment does not have the effect of  discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs or former HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The facts are the same as in Example 7, except that Plan  F limits the grant of past service credit to five years, and the grant  of past service otherwise satisfies the safe harbor in paragraph (a)(3)  of this section. The timing of this plan establishment is deemed not to  have the effect of discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs or  former HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that,  five years after the establishment of Plan F, Employer W amends the plan  to provide a benefit equal to two percent of average annual compensation  per year of service, taking into account all years of service since the  establishment of the plan. The ratio of HCEs to former HCEs who  terminated employment during the five-year period since the  establishment of the plan is significantly higher than the ratio of  NHCEs to former NHCEs who terminated employment during the five-year  period since the establishment of the plan. Although the amendment  described in this example might separately satisfy the safe harbor in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the safe harbor is not available with  respect to the amendment because, under these facts, the amendment is  part of a pattern of amendments that has the effect of discriminating  significantly in favor of HCEs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Employer Y maintains Plan G, a defined benefit plan,  covering all its employees. In 1995, Employer Y acquires Division S from  Employer Z. Some of the employees of Division S had been covered under a  defined benefit plan maintained by Employer Z. Soon after the  acquisition, Employer Y amends Plan G to cover all employees of Division  S and to credit those who were in Division S's defined benefit plan with  years of service for years of employment with Employer Z. Because the  timing of the plan amendment was determined by the timing of the  transaction, the timing of this plan amendment does not have the effect  of discriminating significantly in favor of HCEs or former HCEs. See  also Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3) for other rules regarding the crediting  of pre-participation service.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Plan H is an insurance contract plan within the meaning  of section 412(i). For all plan years before 1999, Plan H purchases  insurance contracts from Insurance Company J. In 1999, Plan H shifts  future purchases of insurance contracts to Insurance Company K. The  shift in insurance companies is a plan amendment subject to this  paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Pre-termination restrictions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Required provisions in defined  benefit plans. A defined benefit plan has the effect of discriminating  significantly in favor of   HCEs or former HCEs unless it incorporates provisions restricting  benefits and distributions as described in paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of  this section at the time the plan is established or, if later, as of the  first plan year to which Sec.

For this purpose, a plan's target age is the  lower of age 50 or the average attained age of the HCEs in the plan  minus X years, where X equals 20 minus the product of five times the  employee contribution rate under the plan. In no case, however, may X  years be fewer than zero (0) years. Thus, for example, if the average  attained age of the HCEs in the plan is 53 and the employee contribution  rate is two percent of plan year compensation, the plan's target age is  43 years (i.e., 53-(20-(5x2))).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ratio test.

Attained ages must be determined as of the  beginning of the plan year.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan A is a contributory DB plan that is a defined  benefit excess plan providing a benefit equal to 2.0 percent of  employees' average annual compensation at or below covered compensation,  plus 2.5 percent of average annual compensation above covered  compensation, times years of service up to 35. Under the plan, average  annual compensation is determined using a five-consecutive-year period  for purposes of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(e)(2). The plan requires employee  contributions at a rate of four percent of plan year compensation for  all employees. Assume that the plan satisfies the demographic  requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Under these  facts, the plan satisfies the eligibility requirements of paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Assume, further, that the average attained  age for all employees in the plan is 55, and that the average years of  participation of all employees in the plan is 10. The average entry age  for the plan is therefore 45, and, accordingly, the appropriate factor  under the table is 0.2. Thus, in applying the safe harbor requirements  of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b) to this plan for the plan year (including the  requirements of Sec. 1.401(l)-3), the employee's base benefit  percentage and excess benefit percentage are each reduced by 0.8 percent  (4 percentx0.2) and equal 1.2 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  employee contribution rate is two percent of plan year compensation up  to the covered compensation level, and four percent for plan year  compensation at or above that contribution breakpoint. The employer  elects to apply the alternative method in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of  this section to determine the reduction in the base benefit percentage.  Because the contribution breakpoint is equal to the integration level,  the weight of the employee contribution rate below the contribution  breakpoint is 100 percent, and the weight of the employee contribution  rate above the contribution breakpoint is zero. Thus, the weighted  average of employee contribution rates is two percent. Under the  alternative method in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section, the  reduction in the employee's base benefit percentage is 0.4. In applying  the safe harbor requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b) to this plan  (including the requirements of Sec. 1.401(l)-3), the employee's base  benefit percentage is 1.6 percent, and the employee's excess benefit  percentage is 1.7.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  employee contribution rate is two percent of plan year compensation up  to 50 percent of the covered compensation level, and four percent for  plan year compensation at or above that contribution breakpoint. Because  the contribution breakpoint is equal to 50 percent of the integration  level, the weight of the employee contribution rate below the  contribution breakpoint is 50 percent, and the weight of the employee  contribution rate above the contribution breakpoint is 50 percent. Thus,  the weighted average of employee contribution rates is three percent.  Under the alternative method in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this  section, the reduction in the employee's base benefit percentage is 0.6.  In applying the safe harbor requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b) to  this plan (including the requirements of Sec. 1.401(l)-3), the  employee's base benefit percentage is 1.4 percent, and the employee's  excess benefit percentage is 1.7.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the  plan is tested using the general test in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(c). Assume  Employee M benefits under Plan A and has a normal accrual rate for the  plan year (calculated with respect to Employee M's total accrued  benefit) of 2.2 percent of average annual compensation. In applying the  general test in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(c) with respect to employer-provided  benefits, this rate is reduced by 0.8 to yield a normal accrual rate of  1.4 percent. This rate may then be adjusted using either of the optional  rules in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(3)(i) or (ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minimum-benefit method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application of uniform factors.

The portion of  Employee M's benefit accrual for the plan year beginning in 1994 derived  from employee contributions is $2,000, determined by applying the rules  of section 411(c) to such contributions. The requirement of paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section is not satisfied for the plan year beginning  in 1994 unless the plan provides that Employee M's benefit accrual for  the plan year beginning in 1994 is equal to $3,500 ($2,000+(50  percentx$3,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(ii)(D)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Government-plan method.

Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for imputing permitted  disparity with respect to employer-provided contributions by adjusting  each employee's unadjusted allocation rate.

This adjusted allocation rate is used to determine  whether the amount of contributions under the plan satisfies the general  test of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c) and to apply the average benefit  percentage test on the basis of contributions under Sec. 1.410(b)-5(d).

For purposes of this paragraph (c), the following  definitions apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Covered compensation. Covered compensation means covered  compensation as defined in Sec. 1.401(l)-1(c)(7).

Unadjusted accrual rate means the  normal or most valuable accrual rate, whichever is being determined for  the employee under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(d), expressed as a percentage of  average annual compensation, without imputing permitted disparity under  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Employees with negative unadjusted accrual rates.  Notwithstanding the formulas in paragraph (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this  section, if an employee's unadjusted accrual rate is less than zero, the  employee's adjusted accrual rate is deemed to be the employee's  unadjusted accrual rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in this  paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)-3(d)(1)(iii)(A)</em>. Employee M has an unadjusted normal accrual  rate of 1.48 percent, average annual compensation of $21,000, and an  employer-provided accrual of $311 (1.48 percentx$21,000). Employee N has  an unadjusted normal accrual rate of 1.7 percent, average annual  compensation of $106,000, and an employer-provided accrual of $1,802  (1.7 percentx$106,000). The covered compensation of both Employees M and  N is $25,000, and social security retirement age for both employees is  65. Neither employee has testing service of more than 35 years and  neither has ever participated in another plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because Employee M's average annual compensation does not exceed  covered compensation, Employee M's A rate is 2.96 percent (2.0x1.48  percent), and Employee M's B rate is 2.23 percent (1.48 percent+0.75  percent). Thus, Employee M's adjusted accrual rate is 2.23 percent, the  lesser of the A rate and the B rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Because Employee N's average annual compensation exceeds covered  compensation, Employee N's C rate is 1.93 percent ($1,802/($106,000- (0.5x$25,000))), and Employee N's D rate is 1.88 percent (($1,802+(0.75  percentx$25,000))/$106,000).

Thus, if an employee who benefits  under the plan for the current plan year also benefits under a section  401(l) plan for the plan year ending with or within the current plan  year, permitted disparity may not be imputed for that employee for the  plan year. See Sec. 1.401(l)-5(b)(9), Example 4. Similarly, if an  employee who benefits under the plan for the current plan year also  benefits under another plan of the employer for the plan year ending  with or within the current plan year, disparity may be imputed for that  employee under only one of the plans.

In determining whether a plan  has broadly available allocation rates for the plan year within the  meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, an employee's  allocation may be disregarded to the extent that the allocation is a  transition allocation for the plan year.

Plan provisions providing for transition allocations for the  plan year must specify both the group of employees who are eligible for  the transition allocations and the amount of the transition allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> does not apply to a plan amendment that reduces  transition allocations to HCEs, makes de minimis changes in the  calculation of the transition allocations (such as a change in the  definition of compensation to include section 132(f) elective  reductions), or adds or removes a provision permitted under paragraph  (b)(1)(iii)(C)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain permitted plan provisions. An allocation does not fail  to be a transition allocation within the meaning of paragraph  (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section merely because the plan provides that  each employee who is eligible for a transition allocation receives the  greater of such allocation and the allocation for which the employee  would otherwise be eligible under the plan. In a plan that contains such  a provision, for purposes of determining whether the plan has broadly  available allocation rates within the meaning of paragraph  (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the allocation for which an employee  would otherwise be eligible is considered currently available to the  employee, even if the employee's transition allocation is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Defined benefit replacement allocation.

An employer that accepts a transfer of  assets (within the meaning of section 414(l)) from the plan of a prior  employer may continue to treat any transition allocations provided under  that plan as transition allocations under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of  this section, provided that the successor employer continues to satisfy  the applicable requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(C)  through (E) of this section for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gradual age or service schedule--(A) In general. A plan has a  gradual age or service schedule for the plan year if the allocation  formula for all employees under the plan provides for a single schedule  of allocation rates under which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The schedule defines a series of bands based solely on age,  years of service, or the number of points representing the sum of age  and years of service (age and service points), under which the same  allocation rate applies to all employees whose age, years of service, or  age and service points are within each band; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The allocation rates under the schedule increase smoothly at  regular intervals, within the meaning of paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) and  (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Smoothly increasing schedule of allocation rates. A schedule of  allocation rates increases smoothly if the allocation rate for each band  within the schedule is greater than the allocation rate for the  immediately preceding band (i.e., the band with the next lower number of  years of age, years of service, or age and service points) but by no  more than 5 percentage points. However, a schedule of allocation rates  will not be treated as increasing smoothly if the ratio of the  allocation rate for any band to the rate for the immediately preceding  band is more than 2.0 or if it exceeds the ratio of allocation rates  between the two immediately preceding bands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Regular intervals. A schedule of allocation rates has regular  intervals of age, years of service or age and service points, if each  band, other than the band associated with the highest age, years of  service, or age and service points, is the same length. For this  purpose, if the schedule is based on age, the first band is deemed to be  of the same length as the other bands if it ends at or before age 25. If  the first age band ends after age 25, then, in determining whether the  length of the first band is the same as the length of other bands, the  starting age for the first age band is permitted to be treated as age 25  or any age earlier than 25. For a schedule of allocation rates based on  age and service points, the rules of the preceding two sentences are  applied by substituting 25 age and service points for age 25. For a  schedule of allocation rates based on service, the starting service for  the first service band is permitted to be treated as one year of service  or any lesser amount of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Minimum allocation rates permitted. A schedule of allocation  rates under a plan does not fail to increase smoothly at regular  intervals, within the meaning of paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (C) of  this section, merely because a minimum uniform allocation rate is  provided for all employees or the minimum benefit described in section  416(c)(2) is provided for all non-key employees (either because the plan  is top heavy or without regard to whether the plan is top heavy) if the  schedule satisfies one of the following conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iv)(B)</em> and (C) of this section, where  the hypothetical schedule has a lowest allocation rate no lower than 1%  of plan year compensation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a plan using a schedule of allocation rates based on age,  for each age band in the schedule that provides an allocation rate  greater than the minimum allocation rate, there could be an employee in  that age band with an equivalent accrual rate that is less than or equal  to the equivalent accrual rate that would apply to an employee whose age  is the highest age for which the allocation rate equals the minimum  allocation rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Uniform target benefit allocations. A plan has allocation rates  that are based on a uniform target benefit allocation for the plan year  if the plan fails to satisfy the requirements for the safe harbor  testing method in paragraph (b)(3) of this section merely because the  determination of the allocations under the plan differs from the  allocations determined under that safe harbor testing method for any of  the following reasons--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The interest rate used for determining the actuarial present  value of the stated plan benefit and the theoretical reserve is lower  than a standard interest rate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The stated benefit is calculated assuming compensation increases  at a specified rate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The plan computes the current year contribution using the actual  account balance instead of the theoretical reserve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Minimum allocation gateway--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. A plan satisfies  the minimum allocation gateway of this paragraph (b)(1)(vi) if each NHCE  has an allocation rate that is at least one third of the allocation rate  of the HCE with the highest allocation rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deemed satisfaction. A plan is deemed to satisfy the minimum  allocation gateway of this paragraph (b)(1)(vi) if each NHCE receives an  allocation of at least 5% of the NHCE's compensation within the meaning  of section 415(c)(3), measured over a period of time permitted under the  definition of plan year compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Determination of allocation rate. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, allocations and allocation rates are  determined under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2), but without taking into  account the imputation of permitted disparity under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7.  However, in determining whether the plan has broadly available  allocation rates as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section,  differences in allocation rates attributable solely to the use of  permitted disparity described in Sec. 1.401(l)-2 are disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (b)(1):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plan M, a defined contribution plan without a minimum  service requirement, provides an allocation formula under which  allocations are provided to all employees according to the following  schedule:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Ratio of</p><p class="depth0">allocation</p><p class="depth0">rate for</p><p class="depth0">Allocation    band to</p><p class="depth0">Completed years of service              rate (in    allocation</p><p class="depth0">percent)     rate for</p><p class="depth0">immediately</p><p class="depth0">preceding</p><p class="depth0">band ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 0-5...........................................          3.0        (\1\) 6-10..........................................          4.5         1.50 11-15.........................................          6.5         1.44 16-20.........................................          8.5         1.31 21-25.........................................         10.0         1.18 26 or more....................................         11.5        1.15 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ Not applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan M provides that allocation rates for all employees are  determined using a single schedule based solely on service, as described  in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A)(1) of this section.

In addition, the bands (other  than the highest band) are all 5 years long, so the increases occur at  regular intervals as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this  section.

However, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(D) of this section, the  schedule of allocation rates does not fail to increase smoothly at  regular intervals merely because the minimum allocation rate of 3%  results in a first band that is longer than the other bands, if either  of the conditions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(D)(1) or (2) of this section  is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In this case, in order to define a hypothetical schedule that  could include the allocation rates in the actual schedule of allocation  rates, each of the bands below age 40 would have to be 5 years long (or  be treated as 5 years long).

Accordingly, in order for the applicable  allocations rates under this hypothetical schedule to increase smoothly,  the ratio of the allocation rate for each band in the hypothetical  schedule below age 40 to the allocation rate for the immediately  preceding band would have to be 2.0. Thus, the allocation rate for the  hypothetical band applicable for employees under age 30 would be .75%,  the allocation rate for the hypothetical band for employees in the range  30-34 would be 1.5% and the allocation rate for employees in the range  35-39 would be 3%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Because the lowest allocation rate under any possible  hypothetical schedule is less than 1% of plan year compensation, Plan O  will be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraphs  (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (C) of this section only if the schedule of allocation  rates satisfies the steepness condition described in paragraph  (b)(1)(iv)(D)(2) of this section. In this case, the steepness condition  is not satisfied because the equivalent accrual rate for an employee age  39 is 2.81%, but there is no hypothetical employee in the band for ages  40-44 with an equal or lower equivalent accrual rate (since the lowest  equivalent accrual rate for hypothetical employees within this band is  3.74% at age 44).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Since the schedule of allocation rates under the plan does not  increase smoothly at regular intervals, Plan O's schedule of allocation  rates is not a gradual age or service schedule. Further, Plan O does not  provide uniform target benefit allocations. Therefore, under paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of this section, Plan O cannot satisfy the nondiscrimination  in amount requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) for the plan year on  the basis of benefits unless either Plan O provides for broadly  available allocation rates for the plan year as described in paragraph  (b)(1)(iii) of this section (i.e., the allocation rate at each age is  provided to a group of employees that satisfies section 410(b) without  regard to the average benefit percentage test), or Plan O satisfies the  minimum allocation gateway of paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section for  the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plan P is a profit-sharing plan maintained by  Employer A that covers all of Employer A's employees, consisting of two  HCEs, X and Y, and 7 NHCEs. Employee   X's compensation is $170,000 and Employee Y's compensation is $150,000.  The allocation for Employees X and Y is $30,000 each, resulting in an  allocation rate of 17.65% for Employee X and 20% for Employee Y. Under  Plan P, each NHCE receives an allocation of 5% of compensation within  the meaning of section 415(c)(3), measured over a period of time  permitted under the definition of plan year compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the allocation rate for X is not currently available to  any NHCE, Plan P does not have broadly available allocation rates within  the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.

Thus, under paragraph  (b)(1)(i) of this section, Plan P can satisfy the nondiscrimination in  amount requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) for the plan year on the  basis of benefits only if Plan P satisfies the minimum allocation  gateway of paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The highest allocation rate for any HCE under Plan P is 20%.

An employee's equivalent accrual rate for a plan year is the annual  benefit that is the result of normalizing the increase in the employee's  account balance during the measurement period, divided by the number of  years in which the employee benefited under the plan during the  measurement period, and expressed either as a dollar amount or as a  percentage of the employee's average annual compensation. A measurement  period that includes future years may not be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules of application--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determination of account balance. The  increase in the account balance during the measurement period taken into  account under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section does not include  income, expenses, gains, or losses allocated during the measurement  period that are attributable to the account balance as of the beginning  of the measurement period, but does include any additional amounts that  would have been included in the increase in the account balance but for  the fact that they were previously distributed (including a reasonable  adjustment for interest). In the case of a measurement period that is  the current plan year, an employer may also elect to disregard the  income, expenses, gains, and losses allocated during the current plan  year that are attributable to the increase in account balance since the  beginning of the year, and thus, determine the increase in account  balance during the plan year taking into account only the allocations  described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(ii). In addition, an employer may  disregard distributions made to a NHCE as well as distributions made to  any employee in plan years beginning before a selected date no later  than January 1, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Normalization. The account balances determined under paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section are normalized by treating them as single- sum benefits that are immediately and unconditionally payable to the  employee. A standard interest rate, and a straight life annuity factor  that is based on the same or a different standard interest rate and on a  standard mortality table, must be used in normalizing these benefits. In  addition, no mortality may be assumed prior to the employee's testing  age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> (dealing with compensation adjustments to the frozen  accrued benefit) is not applicable. No other options are available in  determining an employee's equivalent accrual rate except those (e.g.,  selection of alternative measurement periods) specifically provided in  this paragraph (b)(2). Thus, for example, none of the optional special  rules in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(f) (e.g., determination of benefits on  other than a plan year basis under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(f)(6)) is  available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consistency rule. Equivalent accrual rates must be determined  in a consistent manner for all employees for the plan year. Thus, for  example, the same measurement periods and standard interest rates must  be used, and any available options must be applied consistently if at  all.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safe-harbor testing method for target benefit plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General  rule. A target benefit plan is a money purchase pension plan under which  contributions to an employee's account are determined by reference to  the amounts necessary to fund the employee's stated benefit under the  plan. Whether a target benefit plan satisfies section 401(a)(4) with  respect to an equivalent amount of benefits is generally determined  under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A target benefit  plan is deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(4) with respect to an  equivalent amount of benefits, however, if each of the following  requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stated benefit formula. Each employee's stated benefit must be  determined as the straight life annuity commencing at the employee's  normal retirement age under a formula that would satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(4)(i)(C) (1) or (2), and that  would satisfy each of the uniformity requirements in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 3(b)(2) (taking into account the relevant exceptions provided in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(6)), if the plan were a defined benefit plan with the  same benefit formula. In determining whether these requirements are  satisfied, the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(f) do not apply, and, in  addition, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section,  an employee's stated benefit at normal retirement age under the stated  benefit formula is deemed to accrue ratably over the period ending with  the plan year in which the employee is projected to reach normal  retirement age and beginning with the latest of: the first plan year in  which the employee benefited under the plan, the first plan year taken  into account in the stated benefit formula, and any plan year  immediately following a plan year in which the plan did not satisfy this  paragraph (b)(3). Thus, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of  this section, under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(2)(v) an employee's stated  benefit may not take into account service in years prior to the first  plan year that the employee benefited under the plan, and an employee's  stated benefit may not take into account service in plan years prior to  the current plan year unless the plan satisfied this paragraph (b)(3) in  all of those prior plan years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employer and employee contributions. Employer contributions with  respect to each employee must be based exclusively on the employee's  stated benefit using the method provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this  section, and forfeitures and any other amounts under the plan taken into  account under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(ii) (other than employer  contributions) are used exclusively to reduce employer contributions.  Employee contributions (if any) may not be used to fund the stated  benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Permitted disparity. If permitted disparity is taken into  account, the stated benefit formula must satisfy Sec. 1.401(l)-3. For  this purpose, the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess or offset  allowance in Sec. 1.401(l)-3(b)(2)(i) or (b)(3)(i), respectively, as  adjusted in accordance with Sec. 1.401(l)-3(d)(9) (and, if the  employee's normal retirement age is not the employee's social security  retirement age, Sec. 1.401(l)-3(e)), is further reduced by multiplying  the factor by 0.80.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Changes in stated benefit formula. A plan does not fail to  satisfy paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section merely because the plan  determines each employee's stated benefit in the current   plan year under a stated benefit formula that differs from the stated  benefit formula used to determine the employee's stated benefit in prior  plan years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii))</em>, provided that the limitation applies on the same  terms to all employees. Thus, post-normal retirement benefits required  under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(2)(ii) must be provided under the stated  benefit formula, subject to any uniformly applicable service cap under  the formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Method for determining required employer contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  General rule. An employer's required contribution to the account of an  employee for a plan year is determined based on the employee's stated  benefit and the amount of the employee's theoretical reserve as of the  date the employer's required contribution is determined for the plan  year (the determination date). Paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section  provides rules for determining an employee's theoretical reserve.  Paragraph (b)(3)(iv) (C) and (D) of this section provides rules for  determining an employer's required contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Theoretical reserve--(1) Initial theoretical reserve. An  employee's theoretical reserve as of the determination date for the  first plan year in which the employee benefits under the plan, the first  plan year taken into account under the stated benefit formula (if that  is the current plan year), or the first plan year immediately following  any plan year in which the plan did not satisfy this paragraph (b)(3),  is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Theoretical reserve in subsequent plan years. An employee's  theoretical reserve as of the determination date for a plan year (other  than a plan year described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this  section) is the employee's theoretical reserve as of the determination  date for the prior plan year, plus the employer's required contribution  for the prior plan year (as limited by section 415, but without regard  to the additional contributions described in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this  section) both increased by interest from the determination date for the  prior plan year through the determination date for the current plan  year, but not beyond the determination date for the plan year that  includes the employee's normal retirement date. (Thus, an employee's  theoretical reserve as of the determination date for a plan year does  not include the amount of the employer's required contribution for the  plan year.) The interest rate for determining employer contributions  that was in effect on the determination date in the prior plan year must  be applied to determine the required interest adjustment for this  period. For plan years beginning after the effective date applicable to  the plan under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(a) or (b), a standard interest rate  must be used, and may not be changed except on the determination date  for a plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Required contributions for employees under normal retirement  age. The required employer contributions with respect to an employee  whose attained age is less than the employee's normal retirement age  must be determined for each plan year as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine the employee's fractional rule benefit (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.411(b)-1(b)(3)(ii)(A)) under the plan's stated  benefit formula as if the plan were a defined benefit plan with the same  benefit formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine the actuarial present value of the fractional rule  benefit determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(1) of this section as of  the determination date for the current plan year, using a standard  interest rate and a standard mortality table that are set forth in the  plan and that are the same for all employees, and assuming no mortality  before the employee's normal retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)(B)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determine the required employer contribution for the current  plan year by amortizing on a level annual basis, using the same interest  rate used for   paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(2) of this section, the result in paragraph  (b)(3)(iv)(C)(3) of this section over the period beginning with the  determination date for the current plan year and ending with the  determination date for the plan year in which the employee is projected  to reach normal retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Required contributions for employees over normal retirement age.  The required employer contributions with respect to an employee whose  attained age equals or exceeds the employee's normal retirement age is  the excess, if any, of the actuarial present value, as of the  determination date for the current plan year, of the employee's stated  benefit for the current plan year (determined using an immediate  straight life annuity factor based on a standard interest rate and a  standard mortality table, for an employee whose attained age equals the  employee's normal retirement age) over the employee's theoretical  reserve as of the determination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effect of section 415 and 416 requirements. A target benefit  plan does not fail to satisfy this paragraph (b)(3) merely because  required contributions under the plan are limited by section 415 in a  plan year. Similarly, a target benefit plan does not fail to satisfy  this paragraph (b)(3) merely because additional contributions are made  consistent with the requirements of section 416(c)(2) (regardless of  whether the plan is top-heavy).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certain conditions on allocations. A target benefit plan does  not fail to satisfy this paragraph (b)(3) merely because required  contributions under the plan are subject to the conditions on  allocations permitted under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Special rules for target benefit plans qualified under prior  law--(A) Service taken into account prior to satisfaction of this  paragraph. For purposes of determining whether the stated benefit  formula satisfies paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section (e.g., whether  the period over which an employee's stated benefit is deemed to accrue  is the same as the period taken into account under the stated benefit  formula as required by paragraph (b)(3)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section), a target  benefit plan that was adopted and in effect on September 19, 1991, is  deemed to have satisfied this paragraph (b)(3), and an employee is  treated as benefiting under the plan, in any year prior to the effective  date applicable to the plan under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13 (a) or (b) that  was taken into account in the stated benefit formula under the plan on  September 19, 1991, if the plan satisfied the applicable  nondiscrimination requirements for target benefit plans for that prior  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> of this section, a target benefit plan under which the  stated benefit formula takes into account service for an employee for  plan years prior to the first plan year in which the plan satisfied this  paragraph (b)(3), as permitted under paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A) of this  section, must determine an initial theoretical reserve for the employee  as of the determination date for the last plan year beginning before  such plan year under the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Satisfaction of prior law. In determining whether a plan  satisfied the applicable nondiscrimination requirements for target  benefit plans for any period prior to the effective date applicable to  the plan under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13 (a) or (b), no amendments after  September 19, 1991, other than amendments necessary to satisfy section  401(l), are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples.

For the 1995 plan year, Employee M's average annual  compensation continues to be $60,000.

An employee's equivalent normal and most valuable  allocation rates for a plan year are, respectively, the actuarial  present value of the increase over the plan year in the benefit that  would be taken into account in determining the employee's normal and  most valuable accrual rates for the plan year, expressed either as a  dollar amount or as a percentage of the employee's plan year  compensation. In the case of a contributory DB plan, the rules in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-6(b)(1), (b)(5), or (b)(6) must be used to determine the  amount of each employee's employer-provided benefit that would be taken  into account for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for determining actuarial present value.

The optional rules in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(iv)  (imputation of permitted disparity) and (v) (grouping of rates) may be  applied to determine an employee's equivalent normal and most valuable  allocation rates by substituting those rates (determined without regard  to the option) for the employee's allocation rate in that section where  appropriate. In addition, the limitations under section 415 may be taken  into account under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(2)(ii)(B), and qualified  disability benefits may be taken into account as accrued benefits under  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(f)(2), in determining the increase in an employee's  accrued benefit during a plan year for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)  of this section, if those rules would otherwise be available. No other  options are available in determining an employee's equivalent normal and  most valuable allocations rate except those (e.g., selection of  alternative standard interest rates) specifically provided in this  paragraph (c)(2). Thus, while all of the mandatory rules in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-3(d) and (f) for determining the amount of benefits used to  determine an employee's normal and most valuable accrual rates (e.g.,  the treatment of early retirement window benefits in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 3(f)(4)) are applicable in determining an employee's equivalent normal  and most valuable allocation rates, none of the optional rules under  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3 is available (except the options relating to the  section 415 limits and qualified disability benefits noted above).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consistency rule. Equivalent allocation rates must be  determined in a consistent manner for all employees for the plan year.

A cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that defines  benefits for each employee by reference to the employee's hypothetical  account. An employee's hypothetical account is determined by reference  to hypothetical allocations and interest adjustments that are analogous  to actual allocations of contributions and earnings to an employee's  account under a defined contribution plan. Because a cash balance plan  is a defined benefit plan, whether it satisfies section 401(a)(4) with  respect to the equivalent amount of contributions is generally  determined under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. However,  a cash balance plan that satisfies each of the requirements in  paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) through (xi) of this section is deemed to satisfy  section 401(a)(4) with respect to an equivalent amount of contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan requirements in general. The plan must be an accumulation  plan. The benefit formula under the plan must provide for hypothetical  allocations for each employee in the plan that satisfy paragraph  (c)(3)(iii) of this section, and interest adjustments to these  hypothetical allocations that satisfy paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this  section. The benefit formula under the plan must provide that these  hypothetical allocations and interest adjustments are accumulated as a  hypothetical account for each employee, determined in accordance with  paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section. The plan must provide that an  employee's accrued benefit under the plan as of any date is an annuity  that is the actuarial equivalent of the employee's projected  hypothetical account as of normal retirement age, determined in  accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section. In addition, the  plan must satisfy paragraphs (c)(3)(vii) through (xi) of this section  (to the extent applicable) regarding optional forms of benefit, past  service credits, post-normal retirement age benefits, certain uniformity  requirements, and changes in the plan's benefit formula, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hypothetical allocations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The hypothetical  allocations provided under the plan's benefit formula must satisfy  either paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section. Paragraph  (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section provides a design-based safe harbor that   does not require the annual comparison of hypothetical allocations under  the plan. Paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section requires the annual  comparison of hypothetical allocations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>, the plan's benefit formula must provide for  hypothetical allocations for all employees in the plan for all plan  years of amounts that would satisfy Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(3) for each  such plan year if the hypothetical allocations were the only allocations  under a defined contribution plan for the employees for those plan  years. Thus, the plan's benefit formula must provide for hypothetical  allocations for all employees in the plan for all plan years that are  the same percentage of plan year compensation or the same dollar amount.  In determining whether the hypothetical allocations satisfy Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(3), the only provisions of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(5)  that apply are Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(5)(ii) (section 401(l) permitted  disparity, (iii) (entry dates), (vi) (certain limits on allocations),  and (vii) (dollar allocation per uniform unit of service). Thus, for  example, the plan's benefit formula may take permitted disparity into  account in a manner allowed under Sec. 1.401(l)-2 for defined  contribution plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>,  the plan's benefit formula must provide for hypothetical allocations for  all employees in the plan for the plan year that would satisfy the  general test in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c) for the plan year, if the  hypothetical allocations were the only allocations for the employees  taken into account under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(ii) under a defined  contribution plan for the plan year. In determining whether the  hypothetical allocations satisfy Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c), the provisions  of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(iii) through (v) apply. Thus, for example,  permitted disparity may be imputed under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(2)(iv)  in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7(b) applicable to  defined contribution plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Interest adjustments to hypothetical allocations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General  rule. The plan benefit formula must provide that the dollar amount of  the hypothetical allocation for each employee for a plan year is  automatically adjusted using an interest rate that satisfies paragraph  (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, compounded no less frequently than  annually, for the period that begins with a date in the plan year and  that ends at normal retirement age. This requirement is not satisfied if  any portion of the interest adjustments to a hypothetical allocation are  contingent on the employee's satisfaction of any requirement. Thus, for  example, the interest adjustments to a hypothetical allocation must be  provided through normal retirement age, even though the employee  terminates employment or commences benefits before that age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requirements with respect to interest rates. The interest rate  must be a single interest rate specified in the plan that is the same  for all employees in the plan for all plan years. The interest rate must  be either a standard interest rate or a variable interest rate. If the  interest rate is a variable interest rate, it must satisfy paragraph  (c)(3)(iv)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permissible variable interest rates.

The current value of  the variable interest rate that applies for a period must be either the  value of the variable interest rate determined as of a specified date in  the period or the immediately preceding period, or the average of the  values of the variable interest rate as of two or more specified dates  during the current period or the immediately preceding period. The value  as of a date of the rate on a Treasury Bill is the average auction rate  for the week or month in which the date falls, as reported in the  Federal Reserve Bulletin. The value as of a date of the yield on a  Treasury Constant Maturity is the average yield for the week, month, or  year in which the date falls, as reported in the Federal Reserve  Bulletin. (The Federal Reserve Bulletin is published by the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System and is available from  Publication Services, Mail Stop 138, Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System, Washington DC 20551.) The plan may limit the current  value of the variable interest rate to a maximum (not less than the  highest standard interest rate), or a minimum (not more than the lowest  standard interest rate), or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Hypothetical account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Current value of hypothetical account.  As of any date, the current value of an employee's hypothetical account  must equal the sum of all hypothetical allocations and the respective  interest adjustments to each such hypothetical allocation provided  through that date for the employee under the plan's benefit formula  (without regard to any interest adjustments provided under the plan's  benefit formula for periods after that date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Value of hypothetical account as of normal retirement age. Under  paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section, the value of an employee's  hypothetical account must be determined as of normal retirement age in  order to determine the employee's accrued benefit as of any date at or  before normal retirement age. As of any date at or before normal  retirement age, the value of an employee's hypothetical account as of  normal retirement age must equal the sum of each hypothetical allocation  provided through that date for the employee under the plan's benefit  formula, plus the interest adjustments provided through normal  retirement age on each of those hypothetical allocations for the  employee under the plan's benefit formula (without regard to any  hypothetical allocations that might be provided after that date under  the plan's benefit formula). If the interest rate specified in the plan  is a variable interest rate, the plan must specify that the  determination in the preceding sentence is made by assuming that the  current value of the variable interest rate for all future periods is  either the current value of the variable interest rate for the current  period or the average of the current values of the variable interest  rate for the current period and one or more periods immediately  preceding the current period (not to exceed 5 years in the aggregate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Determination of accrued benefit--(A) Definition of accrued  benefit.

The separate  benefit that each employee accrues for a plan year is an annuity that is  the actuarial equivalent of the employee's hypothetical allocation for  that plan year, including the   automatic adjustments for interest through normal retirement age  required under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Normal form of benefit. The annuity specified in paragraph  (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section must provide an annual benefit payable in  the same form at the same uniform normal retirement age for all  employees in the plan. The annual benefit must be the normal retirement  benefit under the plan (within the meaning of section 411(a)(9)) under  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determination of actuarial equivalence. For purposes of this  paragraph (c)(3)(vi) and paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section, actuarial  equivalence must be determined using a standard mortality table and  either a standard interest rate or the interest rate specified in the  plan for making interest adjustments to hypothetical allocations. If the  interest rate used is the interest rate specified in the plan, and that  rate is a variable interest rate, the assumed value of the variable  interest rate for all future periods must be the same value that would  be assumed for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) of this section. The  same actuarial assumptions must be used for all employees in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Effect of section 415 and 416 requirements. A plan does not fail  to satisfy this paragraph (c)(3)(vi) merely because the accrued benefits  under the plan are limited by section 415, or merely because the accrued  benefits under the plan are the greater of the accrued benefits  otherwise determined under the plan and the minimum benefit described in  section 416(c)(1) (regardless of whether the plan is top-heavy).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Optional forms of benefit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.

Except as otherwise  required under section 415(b), if the plan provides for a distribution  alternative that is subject to the interest rate restrictions under  section 417(e), the actuarial present value of the benefit paid to an  employee under the distribution alternative must equal the  nonforfeitable percentage (determined under the plan's vesting schedule)  of the greater of the following two amounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The current value of the employee's hypothetical account as of  the date the distribution commences, calculated in accordance with  paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The actuarial present value (calculated in accordance with Sec.  1.417(e)-1(d)) of the employee's accrued benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Determination of actuarial present value.

In order to satisfy this requirement, the hypothetical  allocation attributable to a year of past service must be adjusted for  interest in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section for the  period (including the retroactive period) beginning with the year of  past service to which the hypothetical allocation is attributable and  ending at normal retirement age. If the interest rate specified in the  plan is a variable interest rate, the interest adjustments for the  period prior to the current plan year either must be based on the  current value of the variable interest rate for the period in which the  grant of past service first becomes effective or must be reconstructed  based on the then current value of the variable interest rate that would  have applied during each prior period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Employees beyond normal retirement age. In the case of an  employee who commences receipt of benefits after normal retirement age,  the plan must provide that interest adjustments continue to be made to  an employee's hypothetical account until the employee's benefit  commencement date.

In addition, because the 15% allocation rate is  available only to HCEs, the defined contribution plan cannot satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2 and does not have broadly available  allocation rates within the meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(1)(iii).  Further, the defined contribution plan does not satisfy the minimum  allocation gateway of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(1)(vi) (3% is less than \1/ 3\ of the 15% HCE rate). Therefore, the defined contribution plan within  the DB/DC plan cannot separately satisfy Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) and  does not constitute a broadly available separate plan within the meaning  of paragraph (b)(2)(v)(C) of this section. Accordingly, the aggregated  plans are permitted to demonstrate satisfaction of the nondiscrimination  in amounts requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) on the basis of  benefits only if the aggregated plans satisfy the minimum aggregate  allocation gateway of paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employee A has an aggregate normal allocation rate of 18.93%  under the aggregated plans (3.93% from Plan O plus 15% from Plan P),  which is the highest aggregate normal allocation rate for any HCE under  the plans.

The average of the equivalent allocation  rates for all of the NHCEs under Plan O is 2.19% (the sum of 5.91%,  1.74%, .77%, and .34%, divided by 4). Accordingly, Employer B is  permitted to treat all of the NHCEs as having an equivalent allocation  rate attributable to Plan O equal to 2.19%. Thus, all of the NHCEs can  be treated as having an aggregate normal allocation rate of 5.19% for  this purpose (3% from the defined contribution plan and 2.19% from the  defined benefit plan) and the aggregated DB/DC plan satisfies the  minimum aggregate allocation gateway of paragraph (b)(2)(v)(D) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Optional rules for demonstrating nondiscrimination in  availability of certain benefits, rights, and features--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Current  availability.

The fact that it may be difficult or  impossible to provide a benefit, right, or feature described in  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section under a plan of a different type  than the plan or plans under which it is provided is one of the factors  taken into account in determining whether the plan satisfies the  effective availability requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Plan restructuring--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A plan may be treated, in  accordance with this paragraph (c), as consisting of two or more  component plans for purposes of determining whether the plan satisfies  section 401(a)(4). If each of the component plans of a plan satisfies  all of the requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) as if it were a  separate plan, then the plan is treated as satisfying section 401(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identification of component plans. A plan may be restructured  into component plans, each consisting of all the allocations, accruals,  and other benefits, rights, and features provided to a selected group of  employees. The employer may select the group of employees used for this  purpose in any manner, and the composition of the groups may be changed  from plan year to plan year. Every employee must be included in one and  only one component plan under the same plan for a plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Satisfaction of section 401(a)(4) by a component plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. The rules applicable in determining whether a component  plan satisfies section 401(a)(4) are the same as those applicable to a  plan. Thus, for this purpose, any reference to a plan in section  401(a)(4) and the regulations thereunder (other than this paragraph (c))  is interpreted as a reference to a component plan. As is true for a  plan, whether a component plan satisfies the uniformity and other  requirements applicable to safe harbor plans under Sec. Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-2(b) and 1.401(a)(4)-3(b) is determined on a design basis.  Thus, for example, plan provisions are not disregarded merely because  they do not currently apply to employees in the component plan if they  will apply to those employees as a result of the mere passage of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> for rules regarding the  inapplicability of restructuring to section 401(k) plans and section  401(m) plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Satisfaction of section 410(b) by a component plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General  rule. The rules applicable in determining whether a component plan  satisfies section 410(b) are generally the same as those applicable to a  plan. However, a component plan is deemed to satisfy the average benefit  percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-5 if the plan of which it is a part  satisfies Sec. 1.410(b)-5 (without regard to Sec. 1.410(b)-5(f)). In  the case of a component plan that is part of a plan that relies on Sec.  1.410(b)-5(f) to satisfy the average benefit percentage test, the  component plan is deemed to satisfy the average benefit percentage test  only if the component plan separately satisfies Sec. 1.410(b)-5(f). In  addition, all component plans of a plan are deemed to satisfy the  average benefit percentage test if the plan makes an early retirement  window benefit (within the meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(f)(4)(iii))  currently available (within the meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 3(f)(4)(ii)(A)) to a group of employees that satisfies section 410(b)   (without regard to the average benefit percentage test), and if it would  not be necessary for the plan or any rate group or component plan of the  plan to satisfy that test in order for the plan to satisfy sections  401(a)(4) and 410(b) in the absence of the early retirement window  benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relationship to satisfaction of section 410(b) by the plan.  Satisfaction of section 410(b) by a component plan is relevant solely  for purposes of determining whether the plan of which it is a part  satisfies section 401(a)(4), and not for purposes of determining whether  the plan satisfies section 410(b) itself. The plan must still  independently satisfy section 410(b) in order to be a qualified plan.  Similarly, satisfaction of section 410(b) by a plan is relevant solely  for purposes of determining whether the plan, and not the component  plan, satisfies section 410(b). Thus, for example, a component plan that  does not satisfy the ratio percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(2)  must still satisfy the average benefit test of Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(3),  even though the plan of which it is a part satisfies the ratio  percentage test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of restructuring under other sections. The restructuring  rules provided in this paragraph (c) apply solely for purposes of  sections 401(a)(4) and 401(l), and those portions of sections 410(b),  414(s), and any other provisions that are specifically applicable in  determining whether the requirements of section 401(a)(4) are satisfied.  Thus, for example, a component plan is not treated as a separate plan  under section 401(a)(26).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples.

Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the plan  may be treated as consisting of two component defined benefit plans, one  providing retirement benefits equal to 1.0 percent of average annual  compensation times years of service to the employees at Plant S, and  another providing benefits equal to 1.5 percent of average annual  compensation times years of service to employees at Plant T.

A plan satisfies Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) with respect to  the amount of contributions or benefits provided to former employees if,  under all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the amount of  contributions or benefits provided to former employees does not  discriminate significantly in favor of former HCEs.

Because this amendment increases the disparity in the plan  formula beyond the maximum permitted disparity adjusted for any  reasonable approximation of the increase in the cost of living since the   HCEs retired, Plan A discriminates significantly in favor of former  HCEs, and thus does not satisfy this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Plan  A is only amended to increase the benefits of former employees in pay  status who terminated employment with Employer X after attaining early  retirement age.

This is because service for such periods generally would have  been credited for the employee but for the timing of the plan  establishment or amendment, and the timing of the plan establishment or  amendment must satisfy Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-5(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pre-participation and imputed service. Notwithstanding paragraph  (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that a plan treats pre- participation service and imputed service as actual service with the  employer, such service may be taken into account in determining whether  the plan satisfies Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1 (b)(2) and (b)(3) if the service  satisfies each of the requirements in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this  section taking into account, in the case of imputed service, the  additional rules in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Additional limitations on service-crediting in the case of  certain offsets. Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(3)(i) (B) and (C) of  this section, if a plan credits benefit service or accrual service under  paragraph (d)(3)(i) (B) or (C) of this section for a period before an  employee becomes a participant in the plan, but offsets the benefits  determined under the plan by benefits under another plan (whether or not  qualified or terminated) that are attributable to the same period for  which that service is credited, then that service may not be taken into  account for purposes of determining whether the first plan satisfies  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1 (b)(2) or (b)(3) unless the offset provision applies  on the same basis to all similarly-situated employees (within the  meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pre-participation service. For purposes of  this section, pre-participation service includes all years of service  credited under a plan for years of service with the employer or a prior  employer for periods before the employee commenced or recommenced  participation in the plan (other than past service described in  paragraph (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Imputed service. For purposes of this section, imputed service  includes any service credited for periods after an employee has  commenced participation in a plan while the employee is not performing  services as an employee for the employer (including a period in which  the employee performs services   for another employer, e.g., a joint venture), or while the employee has  a reduced work schedule and would not otherwise be credited with service  at the level being credited under the general terms of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Requirements for pre-participation and imputed service--(A)  Provision applied to all similarly-situated employees--(1) General rule.  A plan provision crediting pre-participation service or imputed service  to any HCE must apply on the same terms to all similarly-situated NHCEs.  Whether two employees are similarly situated for this purpose must be  determined based on reasonable business criteria, generally taking into  account only the circumstances resulting in the employees being covered  under the plan or being granted imputed service and on the situation of  the employees (e.g., the plan in which the employees benefit or the  employer by which they are employed) during the period for which the  pre-participation service or imputed service is credited. For example,  employees who enter a plan as a result of a particular merger and who  participated in the same plan of a prior employer are generally  similarly situated. As another example, employees who are transferred to  different joint ventures or different spun-off divisions are generally  not similarly situated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer X maintains defined benefit Plans A and B and  defined contribution Plan C. Plan A covers all employees who work at the  headquarters of Employer X. Plan B covers some employees in Division M  of Employer X, and Plan C covers the other employees of Division M.  Plans B and C have not been aggregated for purposes of satisfying  section 401(a)(4) or 410(b) for the period for which service is being  credited. Plan A provides that, whenever an employee covered by Plan B  transfers from Division M to the headquarters, the employee's service  credited under Plan B is credited under Plan A, and the employee's  benefit under Plan A is offset by the employee's benefit under Plan B.  However, Plan A provides for no similar recognition of service or offset  for employees covered by Plan C who transfer from Division M to the  headquarters. Plan A does not fail to satisfy this paragraph  (d)(3)(iii)(A) merely because it credits service for employees  transferring from Plan B but not from Plan C, because it is reasonable  to treat employees participating in different plans that have not been  aggregated as not being similarly situated.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Employer X acquires two trades or businesses from different employers.  Employees of the acquired trades or businesses become employees of  Division M and become covered by Plan B. In addition, Plan B is amended  to credit service with one of the trades or businesses but not the  other. Plan B does not fail to satisfy this paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A)  merely because it credits service for one acquired trade or business but  not another, because it is reasonable to treat employees of one acquired  trade or business as not similarly situated to employees of another  acquired trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Legitimate business reason--(1) General rule. There must be a  legitimate business reason, based on all of the relevant facts and  circumstances, for a plan to credit imputed service or for a plan to  credit pre-participation service for a period of service with another  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relevant facts and circumstances when crediting service with  another employer. The following are examples of relevant facts and  circumstances for determining whether a legitimate business reason  exists for a plan to credit pre-participation or imputed service for a  period of service with another employer as service with the employer:  whether one employer has a significant ownership, control, or similar  interest in, or relationship with, the other employer (though not enough  to cause the two employers to be treated as a single employer under  section 414); whether the two employers share interrelated business  operations; whether the employers maintain the same multiple-employer  plan; whether the employers share similar attributes, such as operation  in the same industry or the same geographic area; and whether the  employees are an acquired group of employees or the employees became  employed by the other employer in a transaction between the two  employers that was a stock or asset acquisition, merger, or other  similar transaction involving a change in the employer of the employees  of a trade or business. Other factors may also be relevant for this  purpose, such as the plan's treatment of service with other employers  with which the employer has a similar   relationship and the type of service being credited (e.g., vesting  service as compared to benefit service or accrual service). A legitimate  business reason is deemed to exist for a plan to credit military service  as service with the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)(B)</em>:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Twenty unrelated employers jointly sponsor a multiple- employer plan that covers all employees of the employers. From time to  time, employees transfer employment among the employers. There is a  legitimate business reason for a disaggregated portion of the plan that  benefits the employees of one of the employers to treat service with any  of the other employers as service with the employer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer X owns 20 percent of the outstanding stock of  Employer Y. From time to time, employees transfer from Employer X to  Employer Y at the request of Employer X. Employer X maintains defined  benefit Plan A. Plan A provides that years of service include an  employee's years of service with Employer Y. There is a legitimate  business reason for Plan A to credit service with Employer Y because  Employer X, through its 20-percent ownership interest, benefits from the  service that the transferred employees provide to Employer Y.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employer Z manufactures widgets and belongs to the  National Widget Manufacturers' Association. From time to time, Employer  Z hires employees from other widget manufacturers. Employer Z maintains  a defined benefit plan, Plan B, which credits pre-participation service  for periods of service with all other members of the Association located  in the western half of the United States as service with Employer Z.  There is a legitimate business reason for Plan B to treat service with  other members of the Association as service with Employer Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> No significant discrimination--(1) General rule. Based on all of  the relevant facts and circumstances, a plan provision crediting pre- participation or imputed service must not by design or in operation  discriminate significantly in favor of HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relevant facts and circumstances. The following are examples of  relevant facts and circumstances for determining whether a plan  provision crediting pre-participation service or imputed service  discriminates significantly in favor of HCEs: whether the service credit  does not duplicate benefits but merely makes an employee whole (i.e.,  prevents the employee from being disadvantaged with respect to benefits  by a change in job or employer or provides the employee with benefits  comparable to those of other employees); the degree of business ties  between the current employer and the prior employer, such as the degree  of ownership interest or other affiliation; the degree of excess  coverage under section 410(b) of NHCEs for the plan crediting the  service, taking into account employees who are credited with pre- participation service; whether the other employer maintains a qualified  plan for its employees; the existence of reciprocal service credit under  other plans of the employer or the prior employer; the circumstances  underlying the employee's transfer into the group of employees covered  by the plan; the type of service being credited; and the relative number  of employees other than five-percent owners or the most highly-paid HCEs  of the employer (determined without regard to the one officer rule of  section 414(q)(5)(B)) who are being credited with pre-participation  service or imputed service. The relative number referred to in the last  factor is determined taking into account all employees who have been  over time, or are reasonably expected to be in the future, credited with  such service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iii)(C)</em>. It is assumed that facts not described in an  example do not, in the aggregate, suggest that the relevant plan  provision either does or does not discriminate significantly in favor of  HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer U maintains defined benefit Plans A and B.  Plan A covers all employees who work at the headquarters of Employer U.  Plan B covers all employees of Division M of Employer U. Plan A provides  that, whenever an employee transfers from Division M to the  headquarters, the employee's service credited under Plan B is credited  under Plan A, and the employee's benefit under Plan A is offset by the  employee's benefit under Plan B. Employees, including a meaningful  number of NHCEs, are periodically transferred from Division M to the  headquarters of Employer U for bona fide business reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Plan A provision crediting service under Plan B does not  discriminate significantly in favor of HCEs. The provision is designed  only to prevent employees from being disadvantaged by being transferred  from Division M to the headquarters, and a meaningful number of NHCEs  can be expected to benefit from it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  the only employees transferred from Division M to the headquarters of  Employer U are HCEs (but not the most highly-paid HCEs of Employer U).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> for the current  year, taking into account significant demographic changes over this  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Plan A provision crediting service under Plan B does not  significantly discriminate in favor of HCEs in the current year. This  conclusion is based on the fact that the circumstances underlying the  transfers indicate that they were made for bona fide business reasons,  that Plan A would have satisfied sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) had the  transferred employees participated in Plan A during the period for which  the pre-participation service is credited, and that the transferred  employees are not the most highly-paid HCEs of Employer U.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  the only employee who is transferred from Division M to the headquarters  of Employer U is Employee P, who is among the most highly-paid HCEs of  Employer U. Plan A provides an unreduced early retirement benefit at age  55 for employees with 20 years of service, but Plan B's early retirement  benefits are not subsidized. Employee P is transferred to the  headquarters with 20 years of service credited under Plan B and shortly  before attainment of age 55. Employee P is expected to retire upon  reaching age 55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Plan A provision crediting service under Plan B  discriminates significantly in favor of HCEs in the year of the  transfer. This is because the circumstances underlying this transfer  (i.e., its occurrence shortly before Employee P's expected retirement  and the fact that the transfer significantly increased Employee P's  early retirement benefits) indicate that Employee P was transferred to  the headquarters primarily to obtain the higher pension benefits  provided under Plan A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> are  likely to be higher than those of other employees because, while the  pre-participation service may be used to determine Employee P's benefits  under Plan A, the service must be disregarded in determining Employee  P's testing service. Also, if Employee P's pre-participation service is  used in determining Employee P's entitlement to a benefit, right, or  feature under Plan A, the fact that the service must be disregarded in  determining Employee P's entitlement service for purposes of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-4 may cause the benefit, right, or feature to be treated as  a separate benefit, right, or feature that is currently available only  to Employee P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer V manufactures widgets and belongs to the  National Widget Manufacturers' Association. Each member of the  Association maintains a defined benefit plan that credits pre- participation service for periods of service with other members and  offsets benefits under the plan by benefits under the plans of the other  members. Employer V maintains defined benefit Plan C. Employer V  periodically hires employees from other widget manufacturers who are not  among its most highly-paid HCEs. In 1997, however, the only employee  hired by Employer V from another member of the Association is Employee  Q, who is among Employer V's most highly-paid HCEs. Employee Q receives  pre-participation service credit in accordance with the terms of Plan C.  Some of the plans maintained by other members of the Association  credited pre-participation service to NHCEs for the same period for  which the pre-participation service is credited to Employee Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The provision of Plan C crediting pre-participation service with  other members of the Association does not discriminate significantly in  1997, despite the fact that the only employee who received pre- participation service credit under the provision in that year was among  the most highly-paid HCEs of Employer V. This conclusion is based on the  relative number of employees other than Employer V's most highly-paid  HCEs who have been credited in the past, or are reasonably expected to  be credited in the future, with pre-participation service for periods of  service with other members of the Association, and the fact that other  employees who are NHCEs are being credited with pre-participation  service under a reciprocal agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Employer W owns 79 percent of the outstanding stock of  Employer X. From time to time, employees transfer from Employer W to  Employer X at the request of Employer W. The only employees who have   ever been transferred are HCEs. Employer W maintains a defined benefit  plan, Plan D, which credits employees transferred to Employer X with  imputed benefit and accrual service while employed by Employer X.  Employer X maintains no qualified plan. Plan D would fail either section  401(a)(4) or section 410(b) in the current plan year if the individuals  employed by Employer X were treated as employed by Employer W. In  addition, Plan D would fail either section 401(a)(4) or section 410(b)  in the current plan year if the portion of Plan D covering the  transferred employees were treated as maintained by Employer X. The Plan  D provision crediting imputed benefit and accrual service to employees  transferred to Employer X significantly discriminates in favor of HCEs  in the current plan year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that Plan  D credits the individuals who transfer to Employer X only with imputed  vesting and entitlement service. The Plan D provision crediting imputed  vesting and entitlement service to individuals transferred to Employer X  does not significantly discriminate in favor of HCEs in the current plan  year, because there is less potential for discrimination when the only  types of service being imputed are vesting and entitlement service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(A)(1)</em> also  does not apply in the case of vesting and entitlement service if the  employee is performing services for another employer that is being  treated under the plan as actual service with the original employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain presumptions applicable. Whether an individual has  permanently ceased to perform services as an employee for an employer is  determined taking into account all of the relevant facts and  circumstances. There is a rebuttable presumption for a period of up to  two years that an individual who has ceased to perform services as an  employee for an employer is nonetheless expected to resume performing  services as an employee for the employer, if the employer continues to  treat the individual as an employee for significant purposes unrelated  to the plan. After two years, there is a rebuttable presumption that an  individual who has ceased to perform services as an employee for the  employer is not expected to resume performing services as an employee  for the employer. The fact that an individual is absent to perform jury  duty or military service automatically rebuts the latter presumption.  Other evidence, such as the employer's layoff policy, the terms of an  employment contract, or specific leave to pursue a degree requiring more  than two years of study, may also rebut this presumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)(A)</em> (1) and (2) of this section apply in  the case of an employee whose work hours are temporarily reduced and who  therefore would normally be credited with service at a reduced rate, but  who continues to be credited with service at the same rate as before the  reduction (e.g., an employee who continues to be credited with service  as if the employee were a full-time employee during a temporary change  from a full-time to a part-time work schedule).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Additional factors for determining whether a provision crediting  imputed service discriminates significantly. In addition to the factors  described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, relevant facts  and circumstances for determining whether a plan provision crediting  imputed service during a leave of absence or a period of reduced  services discriminates significantly include any employer policies or  practices that restrict the ability of employees to take leaves of  absence or work temporarily on a part-time basis, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Satisfaction of other service-crediting rules. A plan does not  fail to satisfy this paragraph (d)(3) merely because it credits service  to the extent necessary to satisfy the service-crediting rules in  section 410(a), 411(a), 413, or 414(a), Sec. 1.410(a)-7 (elapsed-time  method of service-crediting) or 29 CFR 2530.200b-2 (regarding hours of  service to be credited), whichever is applicable, or 29 CFR Sec.  2530.204-2(d) (regarding double proration of service and compensation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Family aggregation rules. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Governmental plans. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Corrective amendments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A corrective amendment  that satisfies the rules of this paragraph (g) is taken into account for  purposes of satisfying certain section 401(a) requirements for a plan  year, by treating the corrective amendment as if it were adopted and  effective as of the first day of the plan year. These rules apply in  addition to the rules of section 401(b). Paragraph (g)(2) of this  section describes the scope of the corrective amendments that are  permitted to be made. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section specifies the  conditions under which a corrective amendment may be made. Paragraph  (g)(4) of this section provides a rule prohibiting a corrective  amendment from being taken into account to the extent that it does not  have substance. Paragraph (g)(5) of this section discusses the effect of  the corrective amendments permitted under this paragraph (g) under  provisions other than section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, or the  nondiscriminatory plan amendment requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 1(b)(4), a corrective amendment may retroactively increase accruals or  allocations for employees who benefited under the plan during the plan  year being corrected, or may grant accruals or allocations to  individuals who did not benefit under the plan during the plan year  being corrected. In addition, for purposes of satisfying the  nondiscriminatory current availability requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 4(b) for benefits, rights, or features, a corrective amendment may make  a benefit, right, or feature available to employees to whom it was  previously not available. A corrective amendment may not, however,  correct for a failure to incorporate the pre-termination restrictions of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-5(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Conditions for corrective amendments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  corrective amendment is not taken into account prior to its adoption  under this paragraph (g) unless it satisfies each of the requirements of  paragraph (g)(3) (ii) through (vii) of this section, whichever are  applicable. Thus, for example, if any of the applicable requirements are  not satisfied, any additional accruals arising from an amendment adopted  after the end of a plan year are not given retroactive effect and, thus,  are tested in the plan year in which the amendment is adopted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benefits not reduced. Except as permitted under paragraph  (g)(3)(vi)(C)(2) of this section, the corrective amendment may not  result in a reduction of an employee's benefits (including any benefit,  right, or feature), determined based on the terms of the plan in effect  immediately before the amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> merely because it is not effective prior to the date of  adoption and, therefore, the benefit, right, or feature is not made  currently   available to those employees before that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Time when amendment must be adopted and put into effect--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  General rule. Any corrective amendment intended to apply to the  preceding plan year must be adopted and implemented on or before the  15th day of the 10th month after the close of the plan year in order to  be taken into account for the preceding plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination letter requested by employer or plan  administrator. If, on or before the end of the period set forth in  paragraph (g)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, the employer or plan  administrator files a request pursuant to Sec. 601.201(o) of this  chapter (Statement of Procedural Rules) for a determination letter on  the amendment, the initial or continuing qualification of the plan, or  the trust that is part of the plan, the period set forth in paragraph  (g)(3)(iv)(A) of this section is extended in the same manner as provided  for an extension of the remedial amendment period under Sec. 1.401(b)- 1(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Corrective amendment for coverage or amounts testing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Retroactive benefits must be provided to nondiscriminatory group. Except  as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(v)(B) of this section, if the corrective  amendment is adopted after the close of the plan year, the additional  allocations or accruals for the preceding year resulting from the  corrective amendment must separately satisfy section 401(a)(4) for the  preceding plan year and must benefit a group of employees that  separately satisfies section 410(b) (determined by applying the same  rules as are applied in determining whether a component plan separately  satisfies section 410(b) under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(c)(4)). Thus, for  example, in applying the rules of this paragraph (g)(3)(v), an employer  may not aggregate the additional accruals or allocations for the  preceding plan year resulting from the corrective amendment with the  other accruals or allocations already provided under the terms of the  plan as in effect during the preceding plan year without regard to the  corrective amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Corrective amendment to conform to safe harbor. The requirements  of paragraph (g)(3)(v)(A) of this section need not be met if the  corrective amendment is for purposes of conforming the plan to one of  the safe harbors in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(b) or Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)  (including for purposes of applying the requirements of those safe  harbors under the optional testing methods in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8 (b)(3)  or (c)(3)), or ensuring that the plan continues to meet one of those  safe harbors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Conditions for corrective amendment of the availability of  benefits, rights, and features.

In the case of a section  401(k) plan, a corrective amendment may only be taken into account for  purposes of satisfying Sec. 1.410(b)-3(a)(2)(i) under this paragraph  (g) for a given plan year to the extent that the corrective amendment  grants qualified nonelective contributions within the meaning of Sec.  1.401(k)-6 (QNECs) to nonhighly compensated nonexcludable employees who  were not eligible employees within the meaning of Sec. 1.401(k)-6 for  the given plan year, and the amount of the QNECs granted to each  nonhighly compensated nonexcludable employee equals the product of the  nonhighly compensated nonexcludable employee's plan year compensation  and the actual deferral percentage (within the meaning of section  401(k)(3)(B)) for the given plan year for the group of NHCEs who are  eligible employees. Similarly, in the case of a section 401(m) plan, a  corrective amendment may only be taken into account for purposes of  satisfying Sec. 1.410(b)-3(a)(2)(i) under this paragraph (g) for a  given plan year to the extent that the corrective amendment grants  qualified nonelective contributions (QNECs) to nonhighly compensated  nonexcludable employees who were not eligible employees within the  meaning of Sec. 1.401(m)-5 for the given plan year, and the amount of  the QNECs granted to each nonhighly compensated nonexcludable employee  equals the product of the nonhighly compensated nonexcludable employee's  plan year compensation and the actual contribution percentage (within  the meaning of section 401(m)(3)) for the given plan year for the group  of NHCEs who are eligible employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Correction of rate of match. In the case of a section 401(m)  plan, allocations for a given plan year granted under a corrective  amendment to NHCEs who made contributions for the plan year eligible for  a matching contribution may be treated as matching contributions. These  allocations treated as matching contributions may be taken into account  for purposes of satisfying the current availability requirement of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-4(b) with respect to the right to a rate of match, but may  not be taken into account for satisfying other amounts testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>  if the benefit, right, or feature is made available to all employees in  the plan as of the date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect under other statutory requirements. A corrective  amendment under this paragraph (g) is treated as if it were adopted and  effective as of the first day of the plan year only for the specific  purposes described in this paragraph (g). Thus, for example, the  corrective amendment is taken into account not only for purposes of  sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b), but also for purposes of determining  whether the plan satisfies sections 401(l). By contrast, the amendment  is not given retroactive effect for purposes of section 404 (deductions  for employer contributions) or section 412 (minimum funding standards),  unless otherwise provided for in rules applicable to those sections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (g):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer U maintains a calendar year defined benefit plan  that in 1994 is tested using the safe harbor for flat benefit plans in  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(4). In 1996, Employer U is concerned that the  plan will not satisfy the demographic requirement in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-   3(b)(4)(i)(C)(3) for the 1995 plan year because the average of the  normal accrual rates for all NHCEs is less than 70 percent of the  average of the normal accrual rates for all HCEs. Provided the  corrective amendment would otherwise satisfy this paragraph (g),  Employer U may make a corrective amendment to the plan to increase the  number of NHCEs so that the amended plan satisfies the safe harbor for  the 1995 plan year. The corrective amendment need not satisfy paragraph  (g)(3)(v)(A) of this section because Employer U is retroactively  amending the plan to conform to a safe harbor in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b).  See paragraph (g)(3)(v)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)-4(b)</em> during the 1996 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-4 for 1996 using a safe harbor percentage (or if lower,  the ratio percentage of the plan for 1996). In addition, the corrective  amendment making the right to direct investments available to a larger  group of employees must remain in effect through the end of the 1998  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In order for Employer V to take the corrective amendment into  account for purposes of satisfying the current availability requirement  of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(b) for the portion of the 1997 plan year before  the amendment, the group of employees to whom the right to direct  investments is currently available, taking into account the amendment,  must satisfy the nondiscriminatory classification test of Sec.  1.410(b)-4 for 1997 using a safe harbor percentage (or if lower, the  ratio percentage of the plan for 1997).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternatively, if Employer V adopts the corrective amendment  before the end of the 1996 plan year, the corrective amendment need only  remain in force through the end of the 1997 plan year, or the corrective  amendment may eliminate the right to direct investments (provided that  the elimination remains in effect through the end of the 1997 plan  year).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2. In 1997, Employer  V makes a corrective amendment to extend the plan to employees of  Division O as well as Divisions M and N. Assume that the corrective  amendment satisfies paragraph (g)(3)(v)(A) of this section, and thus,  may be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the  nondiscriminatory amounts requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2) or  the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b). However, the  employees in Division O will not be taken into account in determining  whether the right to direct investments meets the current availability  requirements of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(b) unless the corrective amendment  meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(3)(vi) of this section. Thus,  for example, the group of employees to whom the right to direct  investments is made available as a result of the expansion of coverage,  after taking into account the corrective amendment, must satisfy the  nondiscriminatory clarification test of Sec. 1.410(b)-4 for 1996 using  a safe harbor percentage (or if lower, the ratio percentage of the plan  for 1996). In addition, the amendment making the right to direct  investments available to a larger group of employees must remain in  effect though the end of the 1998 plan year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Employer W maintains a defined benefit plan that covers  all employees and that offsets an employee's benefit by the employee's  projected primary insurance amount. The plan is not eligible to use the  safe harbors under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b) because the plan does not  satisfy section 401(l). Under the plan, the accrual rates for all HCEs  (determined under the general test of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(c)) for 1998  are less than 1.5 percent of average annual compensation, and the  accrual rates for all NHCEs (determined under the general test of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-3(c)) for 1998 are two percent of average annual  compensation. If Employer W adopts a corrective amendment adopted in  1999 that retroactively increases HCEs' benefits under the plan so that  their accrual rates equal those of the NHCEs, the corrective amendment  may not be taken into account in testing the 1998 plan year (i.e., the  accruals that result from the corrective amendment are treated as 1999  accruals), because the accruals for the 1998 plan year resulting from  the corrective amendment would not separately satisfy sections 410(b)  and 401(a)(4). This is the case   even if, after taking the amendment into account, the plan would satisfy  sections 410(b) and 401(a)(4) for the 1998 plan year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Employer X maintains two plans--Plan A and Plan B. Plan A  satisfies the ratio percentage test of Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(2), but Plan  B does not. Thus, in order to satisfy section 410(b), Plan B must  satisfy the average benefits test of Sec. 1.410(b)-2(b)(3). The average  benefit percentage of Plan B is 60 percent. Employer X may take into  account a corrective amendment that increases the accruals under either  Plan A or Plan B so that the average benefit percentage meets the 70  percent requirement of the average benefits test, if the amendment  satisfies paragraph (g)(3)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Employer Y maintains Plan C, which does not satisfy  section 401(a)(4) in a plan year. Under the terms of paragraph (g)(2) of  this section, Employer Y amends Plan C to increase the benefits of  certain employees retroactively. In designing the amendment, Employer Y  identifies those employees who have terminated without vested benefits  during the period after the end of the prior plan year and before the  adoption date of the amendment, and the amendment provides increases in  benefits primarily to those employees. It would be inconsistent with the  purpose of preventing discrimination in favor of HCEs for Plan C to  treat the amendment as retroactively effective under this paragraph (g).  See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Employer Z maintains both a section 401(k) plan and a  section 401(m) plan that provides matching contributions at a rate of 50  percent with respect to elective contributions under the section 401(k)  plan. In plan year 1995, the section 401(k) plan fails to satisfy the  actual deferral percentage test of section 401(k)(3). In order to  satisfy section 401(k)(3), Employer Z makes corrective distributions to  HCEs H1 through H10 of their excess contributions as provided under  Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b). The matching contributions that H1 through H10 had  received on account of their excess contributions are not forfeited,  however. Thus, the effective rate of matching contributions provided to  H1 through H10 is increased as a result of the corrective distributions.  See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(e)(3)(iii)(G). Since no NHCE in the section  401(m) plan is provided with an equivalent rate of matching  contributions, the rate of matching contributions provided to H1 through  H10 does not satisfy the nondiscriminatory availability requirement of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4 in plan year 1995. Employer Z makes a corrective  amendment by October 15, 1996, that grants allocations to NHCEs who made  contributions for the 1995 plan year eligible for a matching  contribution. Employer Z may treat the allocations granted under the  corrective amendment to those NHCEs as matching contributions for the  1995 plan year and, as a result, take them into account in determining  whether the availability of the rate of matching contributions provided  to H1 through H10 satisfies the current availability requirement of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(b) for the 1995 plan year.

Accumulation plan means a defined benefit plan  under which the benefit of every employee for each plan year is  separately determined, using plan year compensation (if benefits are  determined as a percentage of compensation rather as than a dollar  amount) separately calculated for the plan year, and each employee's  total accrued benefit as of the end of a plan year is the sum of the  separately determined benefit for that plan year and the total accrued  benefit as of the end of the preceding plan year.</p><p class="depth0">Acquired group of employees. Acquired group of employees means  employees of a prior employer who become employed by the employer in a  transaction between the employer and the prior employer that is a stock  or asset acquisition, merger, or other similar transaction involving a  change in the employer of the employees of a trade or business, plus  employees hired by or transferred into the acquired trade or business on  or before a date selected by the employer that is within the transition  period defined in section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii). In addition, in the case of  a transaction prior to the effective date of these regulations, the date  by which employees must be hired by or transferred into the acquired  trade or business in order to be included in the acquired group of  employees may be any date prior to February 11, 1993, without regard to  whether it is later than the end of the transition period defined in  section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Actuarial equivalent.

Benefit formula means the formula a defined benefit  plan applies to determine the accrued benefit (within the meaning of  section 411(a)(7)(A)(i)) in the form of an annual benefit commencing at  normal retirement age of an employee who continues in service until  normal retirement age. Thus, for example, the benefit formula does not  include the accrual method the plan applies (in conjunction with the  benefit formula) to determine the accrued benefit of an employee who  terminates employment before normal retirement age. For purposes of this  definition, a change in plan provisions that applies only to certain  employees who terminate within a limited period of time (e.g., an early  retirement window benefit) is treated as a change in the plan's benefit  formula for the employees to whom the change is potentially applicable  during the period that the change is potentially applicable to them.

In the case  of a section 401(l) plan that is an offset plan, each employee's accrued  social security supplement equals the dollar amount of the offset  accrued for the employee under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> PIA offset plan. In the case of a PIA offset plan, each  employee's accrued social security supplement equals the dollar amount  of the offset accrued for the employee under the plan. For this purpose,  a PIA offset plan is a plan that reduces an employee's benefit by an  offset based on a stated percentage of the employee's primary insurance  amount under the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other plans. In the case of any other plan, each employee's  social security supplement accrues ratably over the period beginning  with the later of the employee's commencement of participation in the  plan or the effective date of the social security supplement and ending  with the earliest age at which the social security supplement is payable  to the employee. The effective date of the social security supplement is  the later of the effective date of the amendment adding the social  security supplement or the effective date of the amendment modifying an  existing social security supplement to comply with the requirements of  this definition.

For example, if the QJSA is in the  form of a joint annuity with a 50-percent survivor's benefit, the social  security supplement must provide a 50-percent survivor's benefit. When  section 417(c) requires the determination of a QJSA for purposes of  determining a qualified pre-retirement survivor's annuity as defined in  section 417(c) (QPSA), the social security supplement payable in  conjunction with that QJSA must be paid in conjunction with the QPSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> (other than for purposes of sections  401(a)(11) and 417).

This adjustment is disregarded in determining  whether the underlying definition of compensation used satisfies the  requirements of section 414(s). Thus, for example, if the underlying  definition of compensation is an alternative definition that must  satisfy the nondiscrimination requirement of Sec. 1.414(s)-1(d)(3), in  determining whether that requirement is satisfied with regard to the  underlying definition, the compensation included for any employee is  determined without   any adjustment to reflect the equivalent of full-time compensation  required by 29 CFR 2530.204-2(d).</p><p class="depth0">Social security supplement.

The maximum age is generally 65.

This paragraph (c) provides rules that must be satisfied in order to use  the fresh-start testing options for defined benefit plans in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(6)(vii) and (d)(3)(iii), relating to the safe harbors  and the general test, respectively. Those fresh-start options are  designed to allow a plan to be tested without regard to benefits accrued  before a selected fresh-start date. To the extent provided in paragraph  (d) of this section, those options also may be used to disregard certain  increases in benefits attributable to compensation increases after a  fresh-start date. Although this paragraph (c) generally requires a plan  to be amended to freeze employees' accrued benefits as of a fresh-start  date and to provide any additional accrued benefits after the fresh- start date solely in accordance with certain specified formulas, certain  of these requirements do not apply to a plan that is tested under the  general test of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(c). See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 3(b)(6)(vii) and (d)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General rule. A defined benefit plan satisfies this paragraph  (c) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accrued benefits of employees in the fresh-start group are  frozen as of the fresh-start date in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accrued benefits after the fresh-start date for employees in  the fresh-start group are determined under one of the fresh-start  formulas in paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (c)(5) of this section is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of frozen--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An employee's accrued  benefit under a plan is frozen as of the fresh-start date if it is  determined as if the employee terminated employment with the employer as  of the fresh-start date (or the date the employee actually terminated  employment with the employer, if earlier), and without regard to any  amendment to the plan adopted after that date, other than amendments  recognized as effective as of or before that date under section 401(b)  or Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(g). The assumption that an employee has  terminated employment applies solely for purposes of this paragraph  (c)(3). Thus, for example, the fresh start has no effect on the service  taken into account for purposes of determining vesting and eligibility  for benefits, rights, and features under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permitted compensation adjustments. An employee's accrued  benefit under a plan that satisfies paragraph (d) of this section does  not fail to be frozen as of the fresh-start date merely because the plan  makes the adjustments described in paragraph (d)(7) and (8) of this  section with regard to the fresh-start date. In addition, if the frozen  accrued benefit of an employee under the plan includes top-heavy minimum  benefits, an employee's accrued benefit under a plan does not fail to be  frozen as of the fresh-start date merely because the plan increases the  frozen accrued benefit of each employee in the fresh-start group solely  to the extent necessary to comply with the average compensation  requirement of section 416(c)(1)(D)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Permitted changes in optional forms. An employee's accrued  benefit under a plan does not fail to be frozen as of the fresh-start  date merely because the plan provides a new optional form of benefit  with respect to the frozen accrued benefit, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The optional form is provided with respect to each employee's  entire accrued benefit (i.e., accrued both before and after the fresh- start date);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The plan provided meaningful coverage as of the fresh-start  date, as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The plan provides meaningful current benefit accruals as  described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Floor-offset plans. In the case of a plan that was a floor- offset plan described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(d) prior to the   fresh-start date, an employee's accrued benefit as of the fresh-start  date does not fail to be frozen merely because the actuarial equivalent  of the account balance in the defined contribution plan that is offset  against the defined benefit plan varies as a result of investment return  that is different from the assumed interest rate used to determine the  actuarial equivalent of the account balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fresh-start formulas--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Formula without wear-away. An  employee's accrued benefit under the plan is equal to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The employee's frozen accrued benefit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The employee's accrued benefit determined under the formula  applicable to benefit accruals in the current plan year (current  formula) as applied to the employee's years of service after the fresh- start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Formula with wear-away. An employee's accrued benefit under the  plan is equal to the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The employee's frozen accrued benefit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The employee's accrued benefit determined under the current  formula as applied to the employee's total years of service (before and  after the fresh-start date) taken into account under the current  formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Formula with extended wear-away. An employee's accrued benefit  under the plan is equal to the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount determined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules of application--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consistency requirement. This  paragraph (c)(5) is not satisfied unless the fresh-start rules in this  paragraph (c) (and paragraph (d) of this section, if applicable) are  applied consistently to all employees in the fresh-start group. Thus,  for example, the same fresh-start date and fresh-start formula (within  the meaning of paragraph (c)(4) of this section) must apply to all  employees in the fresh-start group. Similarly, if a plan makes a fresh  start for all employees with accrued benefits on the fresh-start date  and, for a later plan year, is aggregated for purposes of section  401(a)(4) with another plan that did not make the same fresh start, the  aggregated plan must make a new fresh start in order to use the fresh- start rules for that later plan year or any subsequent plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of fresh-start group. Generally, the fresh-start  group with respect to a fresh start consists of all employees who have  accrued benefits as of the fresh-start date and have at least one hour  of service with the employer after that date. However, a fresh-start  group with respect to a fresh start may consist exclusively of all  employees who have accrued benefits as of the fresh-start date, have at  least one hour of service with the employer after that date, and are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Section 401(a)(17) employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this  section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> of this section) and for  whom the current formula is different from the formula used to determine  the frozen accrued benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of fresh-start date. Generally, the fresh-start  date is the last day of a plan year. However, a plan may use a fresh- start date other than the last day of the plan year if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The plan satisfied the safe harbor rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 3(b) for the period from the beginning of the plan year through the  fresh-start date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fresh-start group is an acquired group of employees, and the  fresh-start date is the latest date of hire or transfer into an acquired  trade or business selected by the employer for any employees to be  included in the acquired group of employees; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The fresh-start group is the group of employees with a frozen  accrued benefit that is attributable to assets and liabilities  transferred to the plan and the fresh-start date is the date as of which  the employees begin accruing benefits under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer X maintains a defined benefit plan with a  calendar plan year. The plan formula provides an employee with a normal  retirement benefit at age 65 of one percent of average annual  compensation up to covered compensation multiplied by the employee's  years of service for Employer X, plus 1.5 percent of average annual  compensation in excess of covered compensation, multiplied by the  employee's years of service for Employer X up to 40.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For plan years beginning after 1994, Employer X amends the plan  formula to provide a normal retirement benefit of 0.75 percent of  average annual compensation up to covered compensation multiplied by the  employee's total years of service for Employer X up to 35, plus 1.4  percent of average annual compensation in excess of covered compensation  multiplied by the employee's years of service for Employer X up to 35.  For plan years after 1994, each employee's accrued benefit is determined  under the fresh-start formula in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section  (formula with extended wear-away), using December 31, 1994, as the  fresh-start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> As of December 31, 1994, Employee M has 10 years of service for  Employer X, has average annual compensation of $38,000, and has covered  compensation of $30,000. Employee M's accrued benefit as of December 31,  1994, is therefore $4,200 ((1 percentx$30,000x10 years)+(1.5  percentx$8,000x10 years)). As of December 31, 1995, Employee M has 11  years of service for Employer X, has average annual compensation of  $40,000 (determined by taking into account compensation before and after  the fresh-start date), and has covered compensation of $32,000. Employee  M's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1995, is $4,552, the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $4,552, the sum of Employee M's accrued benefit frozen as of  December 31, 1994, ($4,200) and the amended formula applied to Employee  M's years of service after 1994 ((0.75 percentx$32,000x1 year)+(1.4  percentx$8,000x1 year), or $352); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $3,872, the amended formula applied to Employee M's total years  of service ((0.75 percentx$32,000x11 years)+(1.4 percentx$8,000x11  years)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)-3(b)</em> if all  accrued benefits were determined under it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because Plan A satisfied the requirements for a safe harbor plan  for the period from the beginning of the plan year through the selected  date, paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) of this section permits the selected date  to be a fresh-start date, even if it is not the last day of the plan  year. Thus, Plan A satisfies the requirements in this paragraph (c) for  a fresh start as of the fresh-start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> a second time as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compensation adjustments to frozen accrued benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Introduction. In addition to the fresh-start rules in paragraph (c) of  this section, this paragraph (d) sets forth requirements that must be  satisfied in order for a plan to disregard increases in benefits accrued  as of a fresh-start date that are attributable to increases in  employees' compensation after the fresh-start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section, if  applicable) if paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(7) of this section are  satisfied. Thus, for example, in determining whether such a plan  satisfies Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b), any compensation adjustments to the  employee's frozen accrued benefit described in paragraph (d)(8) of this  section are disregarded. Similarly, in the case of a defined benefit  plan tested under the general test in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(c), the  compensation adjustments described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section  may be disregarded under the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(3)(iii) if  paragraphs (d)(3) through   (d)(7) of this section are satisfied. Of course, any increases in  accrued benefits exceeding these adjustments must be taken into account  under the general test, and a plan providing such excess increases  generally will fail to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-3(b). Where paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(7) of this section  are satisfied with respect to a plan as of the fresh-start date, but one  or more of those paragraphs fail to be satisfied for a later plan year,  further compensation adjustments described in paragraph (d)(8) of this  section may not be disregarded in testing the plan under Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> if the Commissioner determines, based on all of the relevant  facts and circumstances, that the plan provision described in the first  sentence of this paragraph (d)(3) was added primarily in order to  provide additional benefits to HCEs that are disregarded under the  special testing rules described in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Post-fresh-start date. The plan by its terms must provide that  the accrued benefits of each employee in the fresh-start group after the  fresh-start date be at least equal to the employee's adjusted accrued  benefit (i.e., the frozen accrued benefit as of the fresh-start date,  adjusted as provided under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, plus the  compensation adjustments described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> is included in the employee's frozen accrued benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Meaningful ongoing coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The fresh-start  group must have satisfied the minimum coverage requirements of section  410(b) for all plan years from the first plan year beginning after the  fresh-start date through the current plan year. Thus, if a fresh-start  group fails to satisfy the minimum coverage requirements of section  410(b) for any plan year, this paragraph (d)(5) is not satisfied for  that plan year or any subsequent plan year; however, such a failure is  not taken into account in determining whether this paragraph (d)(5) is  satisfied for any previous plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative rules. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this  section, a fresh-start group is deemed to satisfy this paragraph (d)(5)  for all plan years following the fresh-start date if any one of the  following requirements is satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Section 410(b) coverage for first five years. The fresh-start  group must have satisfied the minimum coverage requirements of section  410(b) for the first five plan years beginning after the fresh-start  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ratio percentage coverage as of fresh-start date. The fresh- start group must have satisfied the ratio percentage test of Sec.  1.410(b)-2(b)(2) as of the fresh-start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C))</em> as of the fresh-start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Fresh start before applicable effective date. The fresh-start  date with respect to the fresh-start group must have been on or before  the effective date applicable to the plan under paragraph (a) or (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Meaningful current benefit accruals. The benefit formula and  accrual method under the plan that applies to the fresh-start group in  the aggregate must provide benefit accruals in the current plan year  (other than increases in benefits accrued as of the fresh-start date) at  a rate that is meaningful in comparison to the rate at which benefits  accrued for the fresh-start group in plan years beginning before the  fresh-start date. Whether this requirement is satisfied with respect to  a fresh-start group that does not include all employees in the plan with  an hour of service after the fresh-start date may be determined taking  into account the rate at which benefits are provided to other employees  in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Minimum benefit adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a  section 401(l) plan or a plan that imputes disparity under Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-7, the plan must make the minimum benefit adjustment  described in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excess or offset plans. In the case of a plan that is a defined  benefit excess plan as of the fresh-start date, each employee's frozen  accrued benefit is adjusted so that the base benefit percentage is not  less than 50 percent of the excess benefit percentage. In the case of a  plan that is a PIA offset plan (as defined in paragraph (2)(iii) of the  definition of QSUPP in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12) as of the fresh-start date,  each employee's offset as applied to determine the frozen accrued  benefit is adjusted so that it does not exceed 50 percent of the benefit  determined without applying the offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other plans. In the case of a plan that is not described in  paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, each employee's frozen accrued  benefit is adjusted in a manner that is economically equivalent to the  adjustment required under that paragraph, taking into account the plan's  benefit formula, accrual rate, and relevant employee factors, such as  period of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Adjusted accrued benefit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The term adjusted  accrued benefit means an employee's frozen accrued benefit that is  adjusted as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section and then  multiplied by a fraction (not less than one), the numerator of which is  the employee's compensation for the current plan year and the  denominator of which is the employee's compensation as of the fresh- start date determined under the same definition. For purposes of this  adjustment, the compensation definition must be either the same  compensation definition and formula used to determine the frozen accrued  benefit or average annual compensation (determined without regard to  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(e)(2)(ii)(A) (use of plan year compensation)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.  The numerator of the fraction is the employee's average annual  compensation for the current plan year. The denominator of the fraction  is the employee's reconstructed average annual compensation as of the  fresh-start date. An employee's reconstructed average annual  compensation is determined by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Selecting a single plan year beginning after the fresh-start  date but beginning not later than the last day of the first plan year to  which these regulations apply under paragraph (a) or (b) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determining the employee's average annual compensation for the  selected plan year under the same method used to determine the  employee's average annual compensation for the current plan year under  this paragraph (d)(8)(ii); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Multiplying the employee's average annual compensation for the  selected plan year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  employee's compensation as of the fresh-start date determined under the  same compensation definition and formula used to determine the  employee's frozen accrued   benefit and the denominator of which is the employee's compensation for  the selected plan year determined under the compensation definition and  formula used to determine the employee's frozen accrued benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of section 401(a)(17). In determining the numerators  and the denominators of the fractions described in this paragraph  (d)(8), the annual compensation limit under section 401(a)(17) generally  applies. See, however, Sec. 1.401(a)(17)-1(e)(4) for special rules  applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Option to make less than the full permitted adjustment. A plan  may limit the increase in an employee's frozen accrued benefit for the  current and all future years to a percentage (not more than 100 percent)  of the increase otherwise provided under this paragraph (d)(8).  Furthermore, the plan may, at any time, terminate all future adjustments  permitted under this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, only if it is reasonable to expect as of the fresh-start date  that, over time, the use of this method instead of the general rule of  paragraph (d)(8)(i) will not discriminate significantly in favor of  HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer X maintains a defined benefit plan that is  an excess plan with a calendar plan year. For plan years before 1989,  the plan is integrated with benefits provided under the Social Security  Act, providing each employee with a normal retirement benefit equal to  one percent of the employee's average annual compensation in excess of  the employee's covered compensation, multiplied by the employee's years  of service for Employer X. The benefit formula thus provides no benefit  with respect to average annual compensation up to covered compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As of December 31, 1988, Employee M has 10 years of service for  Employer X and has covered compensation of $25,000 and average annual  compensation of $20,000. Employee M's average annual compensation has  never exceeded $20,000. Therefore, as of December 31, 1988, Employee M's  accrued benefit under the plan is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(4)(i)</em> of this section will be adjusted under this paragraph (d),  using the same compensation definition and formula used to determine the  frozen accrued benefit under paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(7)</em> of  this section. Because the excess benefit percentage under the plan for  years before 1989 was one percent, the plan must provide a base benefit  percentage for those years of at least 0.5 percent. After the minimum  benefit adjustment, Employee M's accrued benefit as of December 31,  1988, is $1,000 (0.5 percentx$20,000x10 years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> As of December 31, 1992, Employee M has 14 years of service and  has covered compensation of $30,000 and average annual compensation of  $35,000. Employee M's adjusted accrued benefit as of December 31, 1992,  is $1,750 ($1,000x$35,000/$20,000), and Employee M's accrued benefit as  of December 31, 1992, is $2,710 (the sum of $1,750 plus $960 ((0.6  percentx$30,000x4 years) plus (1.2 percentx$5,000x4 years))).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  in determining adjusted accrued benefits, the plan specifies the  alternative method of paragraph (d)(8)(v) of this section. This method  may be used because it is reasonable to expect as of the fresh-start  date that, over time, the use of this method instead of the general rule  of   paragraph (d)(8)(i) will not discriminate significantly in favor of  HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As of December 31, 1992, Employee M's adjusted accrued benefit  is $2,000 (10 years of service prior to the fresh-start datex(0.5  percent of $30,000+1.0 percent of the excess of $35,000 over $30,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Alternatively, Employer X may choose to use the method of  paragraph (d)(8)(v) of this section but freezes the covered compensation  level at the dollar level in place as of the fresh-start date. In such  case, Employee M's adjusted accrued benefit as of December 31, 1992,  would have been $2,250 (10 years of service prior to the fresh-start  datex(0.5 percent of $25,000+1.0 percent of the excess of $35,000 over  $25,000)). This method may be used because it is reasonable to expect as  of the fresh-start date that, over time, the use of this method instead  of the general rule of paragraph (d)(8)(i) will not discriminate  significantly in favor of HCEs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  for plan years before 1989, the plan provided a minimum benefit to  certain employees equal to $120 per year of service.

In order to satisfy the optional testing method of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-8(c)(3) after a fresh-start date, a cash balance plan must  apply the rules of paragraph (c) of this section as modified under this  paragraph (f). Paragraph (f)(2) of this section provides an alternative  formula that may be used in addition to the formulas in paragraphs  (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section.

If the plan does not offer a single sum  distribution as of the fresh-start date, the actuarial present value of  the employee's frozen accrued benefit as of the fresh-start date must be  determined using a standard mortality table and the applicable section  417(e) rates, as defined in Sec. 1.417(e)-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Alternative opening hypothetical account.

With respect to service by the employee for the  employer before the determination date, the actual compensation paid to  the employee by the employer during all periods of service of the  employee for the employer covered by the Social Security Act must be  used in determining an employee's projected primary insurance amount.  With respect to years before the employee's commencement of service for  the employer, in determining the employee's projected primary insurance  amount, it may be assumed that the employee received compensation in an  amount computed by using a six-percent salary scale projected backwards  from the determination date to the employee's 21st birthday. However, if  the employee provides the employer with satisfactory evidence of the  employee's actual past compensation for the prior years treated as wages  under the Social Security Act at the time the compensation was earned  and the actual past compensation results in a smaller projected primary  insurance amount, the plan must use the actual past compensation. The  plan administrator must give clear written notice to each employee of  the employee's right to supply actual compensation history and of the  financial consequences of failing to supply the history. The notice must  be given each time the summary plan description is provided to the  employee and must also be given upon the employee's separation from  service. The notice must also state   that the employee can obtain the actual compensation history from the  Social Security Administration.

The following examples illustrate this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer Z maintains a noncontributory defined benefit  plan that uses the calendar year as its plan year. The plan provides a  normal retirement benefit, commencing at age 65, equal to $500 a year,  multiplied by the employee's years of service for Z, limited to the  excess of the amount of the employee's final pay from Z (as determined  in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section) over the employee's  employer-provided primary insurance amount attributable to the  employee's service for Z. If an employee's social security retirement  age is greater than 65, the plan provides for reduction of the  employee's employer-provided primary insurance amount in accordance with  paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section. The plan provides no limitation  on the number of years of service taken into account in determining  benefits under the plan. Employee A retires on July 6, 1995, at A's  social security retirement age of 65 with 35 years of service for Z. The  plan uses the plan year as the 12-month period for determining an  employee's year of final highest pay from the employer. A's compensation  for A's final 5 plan years is as follows:  1995 plan year................................................   $10,500 1994 plan year................................................   $20,000</p><p class="depth0">1993 plan year................................................   $18,000 1992 plan year................................................   $17,000 1991 plan year................................................   $16,500</p><p class="depth0">A's annual primary insurance amount under social security,  determined as of A's social security retirement age, is $9,000, of which  $4,500 is the employer-provided portion attributable to A's service for  Z ($9,000x50 percentx35/35). Under the plan's benefit formula  (disregarding the final pay limitation), A would be entitled to receive  a normal retirement benefit of $17,500 ($500x35 years). However, under  the plan, A's otherwise determined normal retirement benefit of $17,500  is limited to the excess of the amount of A's final pay from Z over A's  employer-provided primary insurance amount under social security  attributable to A's service for Z. Accordingly, A's normal retirement  benefit is determined to be $15,500 ($20,000 (A's final pay from Z) less  $4,500 (A's employer-provided primary insurance amount attributable to  A's service for Z)) rather than $17,500. The final pay limitation in Z's  plan satisfies section 401(a)(5)(D) and this paragraph (e). Accordingly,  the plan maintained by Z does not discriminate in favor of highly  compensated employees within the meaning of section 401(a)(4) merely  because of the final pay limitation contained in the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

However, the plan  provides that A's normal retirement benefit of $16,000 will be limited  to $15,500 ($20,000 (the amount of A's final pay from Z) less $4,500  (\1/2\ of A's primary insurance amount under the Social Security Act)).  The final pay limitation does not satisfy this paragraph (e). The  portion of A's employer-provided primary insurance amount under the  Social Security Act attributable to A's service for Z is 32/35x$4,500,  or $4,114. Therefore, to satisfy this paragraph (e), the final pay  provision in Z's plan may not limit A's otherwise determined normal  retirement benefit of $16,000 to less than $15,886 ($20,000 (the amount  of X's final pay) minus $4,114 (the portion of A's employer-provided  primary insurance amount attributable to A's service for Z)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employer X maintains a noncontributory defined  benefit plan that uses the calendar year as its plan year.

The plan  determines an employee's employer-provided projected primary insurance  amount under social security attributable to the employee's service for  X in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section and applies the  reductions applicable under paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section if  benefits commence before social security retirement age.

Under  the plan formula, A's accrued benefit as of the close of the 2014 plan  year is $11,250 (90 percentx$15,000x25/30). As of the close of the 2014  plan year, the plan's final pay limitation does not affect A's benefit  because A's benefit under the plan as of the close of the plan year and  before application of the final pay limitation ($11,250) does not exceed  A's final pay of $15,400 from X, determined as of the close of the plan  year, less A's employer-provided projected primary insurance amount  under social security attributable to A's service for X ($4,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Assume that, as of the close of the 2015 plan year, A's final  average compensation from X is $14,500 and A's final pay from X is  $15,400.

Accordingly, A's benefit as of the close  of the 2015 plan year and before application of the final pay limitation  is $11,310 (90 percentx$14,500x26/30). Under the plan's final pay  limitation, A's benefit of $11,310 would be limited to $11,200, the  amount of A's final pay from X ($15,400), less A's employer-provided  projected primary insurance amount under social security attributable to  A's service for X ($4,200).

Consequently, if the employee is a 5- percent owner or retired, such employee's required beginning date is  April 1, 2004. However, if the employee's date of birth was July 1,  1933, the 70th anniversary of such employee's birth would be July 1,  2003.

However, if  distributions commence before the employee's required beginning date  under a particular distribution option, such as in the form of an  annuity, the distribution option fails to satisfy section 401(a)(9) at  the time distributions commence if, under terms of the particular  distribution option, distributions to be made for the employee's first  distribution calendar year or any subsequent distribution calendar year  will fail to satisfy section 401(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. If distributions have begun to an employee during the  employee's lifetime (in accordance with section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii)), how  must distributions be made after an employee's death?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. Section 401(a)(9)(B)(i) provides that if the distribution of  the employee's interest has begun in accordance with section  401(a)(9)(A)(ii) and the employee dies before his entire interest has  been distributed to him, the remaining portion of such interest must be  distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution method being  used under section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii) as of the date of his death. The  amount required to be distributed for each distribution calendar year  following the calendar year of death generally depends on whether a  distribution is in the form of distributions from an individual account  under a defined contribution plan or annuity payments under a defined  benefit plan. For the method of determining the required minimum  distribution in accordance with section 401(a)(9)(B)(i) from an  individual account, see Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5. In the case of annuity  payments from a defined benefit plan or an annuity contract, see Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-6.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. For purposes of section 401(a)(9)(B), when are distributions  considered to have begun to the employee in accordance with section  401(a)(9)(A)(ii)?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in A-10 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-6, distributions are not treated as having begun to the  employee in accordance with section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii) until the  employee's required beginning date, without regard to whether payments  have been made before that date. Thus, section 401(a)(9)(B)(i) only  applies if an   employee dies on or after the employee's required beginning date. For  example, if employee A retires in 2003, the calendar year A attains age  65\1/2\, and begins receiving installment distributions from a profit- sharing plan over a period not exceeding the joint life and last  survivor expectancy of A and A's spouse, benefits are not treated as  having begun in accordance with section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii) until April 1,  2009 (the April 1 following the calendar year in which A attains age  70\1/2\). Consequently, if A dies before April 1, 2009 (A's required  beginning date), distributions after A's death must be made in  accordance with section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii) or (iii) and (iv) and Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-3, and not section 401(a)(9)(B)(i). This is the case without  regard to whether the plan has distributed the minimum distribution for  the first distribution calendar year (as defined in A-1(b) of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5) before A's death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a plan provides, in accordance with A-2(e) of this section,  that the required beginning date for purposes of section 401(a)(9) for  all employees is April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar  year in which an employee attains age 70\1/2\, an employee who dies on  or after the required beginning date determined under the plan terms is  treated as dying after the employee's distributions have begun for  purposes of this A-6 even though the employee dies before the April 1  following the calendar year in which the employee retires.

Further, a plan need not have the same method of  distribution for the benefits of all employees in order to satisfy  section 401(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Elections. A plan may adopt a provision that permits employees  (or beneficiaries) to elect on an individual basis whether the 5-year  rule in section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii) or the life expectancy rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv) applies to distributions after the death of  an employee who has a designated beneficiary. Such an election must be  made no later than the earlier of the end of the calendar year in which  distribution would be required to commence in order to satisfy the  requirements for the life expectancy rule in section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii)  and (iv) (see A-3 of this section for the determination of such calendar  year) or the end of the calendar year which contains the fifth  anniversary of the date of death of the employee. As of the last date  the election may be made, the election must be irrevocable with respect  to the beneficiary (and all subsequent beneficiaries) and must apply to  all subsequent calendar years. If a plan provides for the election, the  plan may also specify the method of distribution that applies if neither  the employee nor the beneficiary makes the election. If neither the  employee nor the beneficiary elects a method and the plan does not  specify which method applies, distribution must be made in accordance  with paragraph (a) of this A-4.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5.

Pursuant to section 401(a)(9)(B)(iv)(II), if the surviving  spouse is the employee's sole designated beneficiary and dies after the  employee, but before distributions to such spouse have begun under  section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv), the 5-year rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(ii) and the life expectancy rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) are to be applied as if   the surviving spouse were the employee. In applying this rule, the date  of death of the surviving spouse shall be substituted for the date of  death of the employee. However, in such case, the rules in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iv) are not available to the surviving spouse of the  deceased employee's surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6.

Who is a designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9)(E)?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. A designated beneficiary is an individual who is designated as  a beneficiary under the plan. An individual may be designated as a  beneficiary under the plan either by the terms of the plan or, if the  plan so provides, by an affirmative election by the employee (or the  employee's surviving spouse) specifying the beneficiary. A beneficiary  designated as such under the plan is an individual who is entitled to a  portion of an employee's benefit, contingent on the employee's death or  another specified event. For example, if a distribution is in the form  of a joint and survivor annuity over the life of the employee and  another individual, the plan does not satisfy section 401(a)(9) unless  such other individual is a designated beneficiary under the plan. A  designated beneficiary need not be specified by name in the plan or by  the employee to the plan in order to be a designated beneficiary so long  as the individual who is to be the beneficiary is identifiable under the  plan. The members of a class of beneficiaries capable of expansion or  contraction will be treated as being identifiable if it is possible, to  identify the class member with the shortest life expectancy. The fact  that an employee's interest under the plan passes to a certain  individual under a will or otherwise under applicable state law does not  make that individual a designated beneficiary unless the individual is  designated as a beneficiary under the plan. See A-6 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-8 for rules which apply to qualified domestic relation  orders.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. Must an employee (or the employee's spouse) make an affirmative  election specifying a beneficiary for a person to be a designated  beneficiary under section 40l(a)(9)(E)?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. No, a designated beneficiary is an individual who is designated  as a beneficiary under the plan whether or not the designation under the  plan was made by the employee. The choice of beneficiary is subject to  the requirements of sections 401(a)(11), 414(p), and 417.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. May a person other than an individual be considered to be a  designated beneficiary for purposes of section 401(a)(9)?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. No, only individuals may be designated beneficiaries for  purposes of section 401(a)(9). A person that is not an individual, such  as the employee's estate, may not be a designated beneficiary. If a  person other than an individual is designated as a beneficiary of an  employee's benefit, the employee will be treated as having no designated  beneficiary for purposes of section 401(a)(9), even if there are also  individuals designated as beneficiaries. However, see A-5 of this  section for special rules that apply to trusts and A-2 and A-3 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-8 for rules that apply to separate accounts.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. When is the designated beneficiary determined?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. (a) General rule. In order to be a designated beneficiary, an  individual must be a beneficiary as of the date of death. Except as  provided in paragraph (b) and Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6, the employee's  designated beneficiary will be determined based on the beneficiaries  designated as of the date of death who remain beneficiaries as of  September 30   of the calendar year following the calendar year of the employee's  death. Consequently, except as provided in Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6, any  person who was a beneficiary as of the date of the employee's death, but  is not a beneficiary as of that September 30 (e.g., because the person  receives the entire benefit to which the person is entitled before that  September 30), is not taken into account in determining the employee's  designated beneficiary for purposes of determining the distribution  period for required minimum distributions after the employee's death.  Accordingly, if a person disclaims entitlement to the employee's  benefit, pursuant to a disclaimer that satisfies section 2518 by that  September 30 thereby allowing other beneficiaries to receive the benefit  in lieu of that person, the disclaiming person is not taken into account  in determining the employee's designated beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Surviving spouse. As provided in A-5 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3, if  the employee's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary as of September  30 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the employee's  death, and the surviving spouse dies after the employee and before the  date on which distributions have begun to the surviving spouse under  section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv), the rule in section  40l(a)(9)(B)(iv)(II) will apply. Thus, for example, the relevant  designated beneficiary for determining the distribution period after the  death of the surviving spouse is the designated beneficiary of the  surviving spouse. Similarly, such designated beneficiary will be  determined based on the beneficiaries designated as of the date of the  surviving spouse's death and who remain beneficiaries as of September 30  of the calendar year following the calendar year of the surviving  spouse's death. Further, if, as of that September 30, there is no  designated beneficiary under the plan with respect to that surviving  spouse, distribution must be made in accordance with the 5-year rule in  section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii) and A-2 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deceased beneficiary. For purposes of this A-4, an individual  who is a beneficiary as of the date of the employee's death and dies  prior to September 30 of the calendar year following the calendar year  of the employee's death without disclaiming continues to be treated as a  beneficiary as of the September 30 of the calendar year following the  calendar year of the employee's death in determining the employee's  designated beneficiary for purposes of determining the distribution  period for required minimum distributions after the employee's death,  without regard to the identity of the successor beneficiary who is  entitled to distributions as the beneficiary of the deceased  beneficiary. The same rule applies in the case of distributions to which  A-5 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 applies so that, if an individual is  designated as a beneficiary of an employee's surviving spouse as of the  spouse's date of death and dies prior to September 30 of the year  following the year of the surviving spouse's death, that individual will  continue to be treated as a designated beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. If a trust is named as a beneficiary of an employee, will the  beneficiaries of the trust with respect to the trust's interest in the  employee's benefit be treated as having been designated as beneficiaries  of the employee under the plan for purposes of determining the  distribution period under section 401(a)(9)?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. (a) If the requirements of paragraph (b) of this A-5 are met  with respect to a trust that is named as the beneficiary of an employee  under the plan, the beneficiaries of the trust (and not the trust  itself) will be treated as having been designated as beneficiaries of  the employee under the plan for purposes of determining the distribution  period under section 401(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> are met if, during any  period during which required minimum distributions are being determined  by treating the beneficiaries of the trust as designated beneficiaries  of the employee, the following requirements are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The trust is a valid trust under state law, or would be but for  the fact that there is no corpus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The trust is irrevocable or will, by its terms, become  irrevocable upon the death of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The beneficiaries of the trust who are beneficiaries with  respect to the trust's interest in the employee's benefit are  identifiable within the meaning of A-1 of this section from the trust  instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The documentation described in A-6 of this section has been  provided to the plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of payments to a trust having more than one  beneficiary, see A-7 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 for the rules for  determining the designated beneficiary whose life expectancy will be  used to determine the distribution period and A-3 of this section for  the rules that apply if a person other than an individual is designated  as a beneficiary of an employee's benefit.

If a trust is named as a beneficiary of an employee, what  documentation must be provided to the plan administrator?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. (a) Required minimum distributions before death.

In order to satisfy  the documentation requirement of this A-6 for required minimum  distributions after the death of the employee (or spouse in a case to  which A-5 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 applies), by October 31 of the calendar  year immediately following the calendar year in which the employee died,  the trustee of the trust must either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, (2), and (3) of A-5 of this section are satisfied;  and agree to provide a copy of the trust instrument to the plan  administrator upon demand; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide the plan administrator with a copy of the actual trust  document for the trust that is named as a beneficiary of the employee  under the plan as of the employee's date of death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Relief for discrepancy between trust instrument and employee  certifications or earlier trust instruments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If required minimum  distributions are determined   based on the information provided to the plan administrator in  certifications or trust instruments described in paragraph (a) or (b) of  this A-6, a plan will not fail to satisfy section 401(a)(9) merely  because the actual terms of the trust instrument are inconsistent with  the information in those certifications or trust instruments previously  provided to the plan administrator, but only if the plan administrator  reasonably relied on the information provided and the required minimum  distributions for calendar years after the calendar year in which the  discrepancy is discovered are determined based on the actual terms of  the trust instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of determining the amount of the excise tax under  section 4974, the required minimum distribution is determined for any  year based on the actual terms of the trust in effect during the year.

If an employee's benefit is in the form of an individual  account under a defined contribution plan, what is the amount required  to be distributed for each calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. (a) General rule. If an employee's accrued benefit is in the  form of an individual account under a defined contribution plan, the  minimum amount required to be distributed for each distribution calendar  year, as defined in paragraph (b) of this A-1, is equal to the quotient  obtained by dividing the account (determined under A-3 of this section)  by the applicable distribution period (determined under A-4 or A-5 of  this section, whichever is applicable). However, the required minimum  distribution amount will never exceed the entire account balance on the  date of the distribution. See A-8 of this section for rules that apply  if a portion of the employee's account is not vested. Further, the  minimum distribution required to be distributed on or before an  employee's required beginning date is always determined under section  401(a)(9)(A)(ii) and this A-1 and not section 401(a)(9)(A)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3, whichever is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time for distributions. The distribution required to be made on  or before the employee's required beginning date shall be treated as the  distribution required for the employee's first distribution calendar  year (as defined in paragraph (b) of this A-1). The required minimum  distribution for other distribution calendar years, including the  required minimum distribution for the distribution calendar year in  which the employee's required beginning date occurs, must be made on or  before the end of that distribution calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement. If  distributions of an employee's account balance under a defined  contribution plan are made in accordance with this section, the minimum  distribution incidental benefit requirement of section 401(a)(9)(G) is  satisfied. Further, with respect to the retirement benefits provided by  that account balance, to the extent the incidental benefit requirement  of Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(i) requires a distribution, that requirement is  deemed to be satisfied if distributions satisfy the minimum distribution  incidental benefit requirement of section 401(a)(9)(G) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annuity contracts. Instead of satisfying this A-1, the minimum  distribution requirement may be satisfied by the purchase of an annuity  contract from an insurance company in accordance with A-4 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-6 with the employee's entire individual account. If such an  annuity is purchased after distributions are required to commence (the  required beginning date, in the case of distributions commencing before  death, or the date determined under A-3 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3, in the  case of distributions commencing after death), payments under the  annuity contract purchased will satisfy section 401(a)(9) for  distribution calendar years after the calendar year of the purchase if  payments under the annuity contract are made in accordance with Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-6T. In such a case, payments under the annuity contract will  be treated as distributions from the individual account for purposes of  determining if the individual account satisfies section 401(a)(9) for  the calendar year of the purchase. An employee may also purchase an  annuity contract with a portion of the employee's account under the  rules of A-2(a)(3) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-8.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2.

For required minimum distributions during an employee's  lifetime, what is the applicable distribution period?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  A-4, the applicable distribution period for required minimum  distributions for distribution calendar years up to and including the  distribution calendar year that includes the employee's date of death is  determined using the Uniform Lifetime Table in A-2 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)- 9 for the employee's age as of the employee's birthday in the relevant  distribution calendar year. If an employee dies on or after the required  beginning date, the distribution period applicable for calculating the  amount that must be distributed during the distribution calendar year  that includes the employee's death is determined as if the   employee had lived throughout that year. Thus, a minimum required  distribution, determined as if the employee had lived throughout that  year, is required for the year of the employee's death and that amount  must be distributed to a beneficiary to the extent it has not already  been distributed to the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Spouse is sole beneficiary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-4, if the sole  designated beneficiary of an employee is the employee's surviving  spouse, for required minimum distributions during the employee's  lifetime, the applicable distribution period is the longer of the  distribution period determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this  A-4 or the joint life expectancy of the employee and spouse using the  employee's and spouse's attained ages as of the employee's and the  spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year. The spouse is sole  designated beneficiary for purposes of determining the applicable  distribution period for a distribution calendar year during the  employee's lifetime only if the spouse is the sole beneficiary of the  employee's entire interest at all times during the distribution calendar  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change in marital status. If the employee and the employee's  spouse are married on January 1 of a distribution calendar year, but do  not remain married throughout that year (i.e., the employee or the  employee's spouse die or they become divorced during that year), the  employee will not fail to have a spouse as the employee's sole  beneficiary for that year merely because they are not married throughout  that year. If an employee's spouse predeceases the employee, the spouse  will not fail to be the employee's sole beneficiary for the distribution  calendar year that includes the date of the spouse's death solely  because, for the period remaining in that year after the spouse's death,  someone other than the spouse is named as beneficiary. However, the  change in beneficiary due to the death or divorce of the spouse will be  effective for purposes of determining the applicable distribution period  under section 401(a)(9) in the distribution calendar year following the  distribution calendar year that includes the date of the spouse's death  or divorce.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. For required minimum distributions after an employee's death,  what is the applicable distribution period?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. (a) Death on or after the employee's required beginning date.

However, the  preceding sentence does not apply to a person who has any right  (including a contingent right) to an employee's benefit beyond being a  mere potential successor to the interest of one of the employee's  beneficiaries upon that beneficiary's death. Thus, for example, if the  first beneficiary has a right to all income with respect to an  employee's individual account during that beneficiary's life and a  second beneficiary has a right to the principal but only   after the death of the first income beneficiary (any portion of the  principal distributed during the life of the first income beneficiary to  be held in trust until that first beneficiary's death), both  beneficiaries must be taken into account in determining the beneficiary  with the shortest life expectancy and whether only individuals are  beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the individual beneficiary whose life expectancy is being  used to calculate the distribution period dies after September 30 of the  calendar year following the calendar year of the employee's death, such  beneficiary's remaining life expectancy will be used to determine the  distribution period without regard to the life expectancy of the  subsequent beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer M maintains a defined contribution plan,  Plan X. Employee A, an employee of M, died in 2005 at the age of 55,  survived by spouse, B, who was 50 years old. Prior to A's death, M had  established an account balance for A in Plan X. A's account balance is  invested only in productive assets. A named a testamentary trust (Trust  P) established under A's will as the beneficiary of all amounts payable  from A's account in Plan X after A's death. A copy of the Trust P and a  list of the trust beneficiaries were provided to the plan administrator  of Plan X by October 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year  of A's death. As of the date of A's death, the Trust P was irrevocable  and was a valid trust under the laws of the state of A's domicile. A's  account balance in Plan X was includible in A's gross estate under Sec.  2039.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under the terms of Trust P, all trust income is payable  annually to B, and no one has the power to appoint Trust P principal to  any person other than B. A's children, who are all younger than B, are  the sole remainder beneficiaries of the Trust P. No other person has a  beneficial interest in Trust P. Under the terms of the Trust P, B has  the power, exercisable annually, to compel the trustee to withdraw from  A's account balance in Plan X an amount equal to the income earned on  the assets held in A's account in Plan X during the calendar year and to  distribute that amount through Trust P to B. Plan X contains no  prohibition on withdrawal from A's account of amounts in excess of the  annual required minimum distributions under section 401(a)(9). In  accordance with the terms of Plan X, the trustee of Trust P elects, in  order to satisfy section 401(a)(9), to receive annual required minimum  distributions using the life expectancy rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) for distributions over a distribution period equal to  B's life expectancy. If B exercises the withdrawal power, the trustee  must withdraw from A's account under Plan X the greater of the amount of  income earned in the account during the calendar year or the required  minimum distribution. However, under the terms of Trust P, and  applicable state law, only the portion of the Plan X distribution  received by the trustee equal to the income earned by A's account in  Plan X is required to be distributed to B (along with any other trust  income.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> is B's life expectancy.  Because B is not the sole designated beneficiary of the testamentary  trust's interest in A's account in Plan X, the special rule in  401(a)(9)(B)(iv) is not available and the annual required minimum  distributions from the account to Trust M must begin no later than the  end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of A's  death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 1 except that the  testamentary trust instrument provides that all amounts distributed from  A's account in Plan X to the trustee while B is alive will be paid  directly to B upon receipt by the trustee of Trust P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, B is the sole designated beneficiary of A's  account in Plan X for purposes of determining the designated beneficiary  under section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv). No amounts distributed from  A's account in Plan X to Trust P are accumulated in Trust P during B's  lifetime for the benefit of any other beneficiary. Therefore, the  residuary beneficiaries of Trust P are mere potential successors to B's  interest in Plan X. Because B is the sole beneficiary of the  testamentary trust's interest in A's account in Plan X, the annual  required minimum distributions from A's account to Trust P must begin no  later than the end of the calendar year in which A would have attained  age 70\1/2\, rather than the calendar year immediately following the  calendar year of A's death.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8. If a portion of an employee's individual account is not vested  as of the employee's required beginning date, how is the determination  of the required minimum distribution affected?</p><p class="depth0">A-8. If the employee's benefit is in the form of an individual  account, the benefit used to determine the required minimum distribution  for any distribution calendar year will be determined in accordance with  A-1 of this section without regard to whether or not all of the  employee's benefit is vested. If any portion of the employee's benefit  is not vested, distributions will be treated as being paid from the  vested portion of the benefit first. If, as of the end of a distribution  calendar year (or as of the employee's required beginning date, in the  case of the employee's first distribution calendar year), the total  amount of the employee's vested benefit is less than the required  minimum distribution for the calendar year, only the vested portion, if  any, of the employee's benefit is required to be distributed by the end  of the calendar year (or, if applicable, by the employee's required  beginning date).

Thus, for example, amounts that are excluded from income as recovery of  investment in the contract under section 72 are taken into account for  purposes of determining whether section 401(a)(9) is satisfied for a  distribution calendar year.

In order to satisfy section 401(a)(9),  except as otherwise provided in this section, distributions of the  employee's entire interest under a defined benefit plan must be paid in  the form of periodic annuity payments for the employee's life (or the  joint lives of the employee and beneficiary) or over a period certain  that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined  in accordance with A-3 of this section. The interval between payments  for the annuity must be uniform over the entire distribution period and  must not exceed one year. Once payments have commenced over a period,  the period may only be changed in accordance with A-13 of this section.  Life (or joint and survivor) annuity payments must satisfy the minimum  distribution incidental benefit requirements of A-2 of this section.  Except as otherwise provided in this section (such as permitted  increases described in A-14 of this section), all payments (whether paid  over an employee's life, joint lives, or a period certain) also must be  nonincreasing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Life annuity with period certain. The annuity may be a life  annuity (or joint and survivor annuity) with a period certain if the  life (or lives, if applicable) and period certain each meet the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this A-1. For purposes of this section,  if distributions are permitted to be made over the lives of the employee  and the designated beneficiary, references to a life annuity include a  joint and survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Annuity commencement. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annuity payments must commence on or  before the employee's required beginning date (within the meaning of A-2  of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2). The first payment, which must be made on or  before the employee's required beginning date, must be the payment which  is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be  made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment  interval ends in the next calendar year. Similarly, in the case of  distributions commencing after death in accordance with section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv), the first payment, which must be made on or  before the date determined under A-3(a) or (b) (whichever is applicable)  of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3, must be the payment which is required for one  payment interval. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments  are received, e.g., bimonthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All  benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar  year must be included in the calculation of the amount of annuity  payments for payment intervals ending on or after the employee's  required beginning date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A defined benefit plan (Plan X) provides monthly annuity  payments of $500 for the life of unmarried participants with a 10-year  period certain.

In order to meet the requirements of this  paragraph, the first monthly payment of $500 must be made on behalf of A  on or before April 1, 2006, and the payments must continue to be made in  monthly payments of $500 thereafter for the life and 10-year period  certain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this A-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The portion of the single sum distribution that is a required  minimum distribution is determined by treating the single sum  distribution as a distribution from an individual account plan and  treating the amount of the single sum distribution as the employee's  account balance as of the end of the relevant valuation calendar year.  If the single sum distribution is being made in the calendar year  containing the required beginning date and the required minimum  distribution for the employee's first distribution calendar year has not  been distributed, the portion of the single sum distribution that  represents the required minimum distribution for the employee's first  and second distribution calendar years is not eligible for rollover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The portion of the single sum distribution that is a required  minimum   distribution is permitted to be determined by expressing the employee's  benefit as an annuity that would satisfy this section with an annuity  starting date as of the first day of the distribution calendar year for  which the required minimum distribution is being determined, and  treating one year of annuity payments as the required minimum  distribution for that year, and not eligible for rollover. If the single  sum distribution is being made in the calendar year containing the  required beginning date and the required minimum distribution for the  employee's first distribution calendar year has not been made, the  benefit must be expressed as an annuity with an annuity starting date as  of the first day of the first distribution calendar year and the  payments for the first two distribution calendar years would be treated  as required minimum distributions, and not eligible for rollover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> may  be disregarded in applying that rule. Such an ancillary death benefit is  excluded in determining an employee's entire interest and the rules  prohibiting increasing payments do not apply to such an ancillary death  benefit.

For example, if an employee's benefit is being distributed  in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the lives of the  employee and the employee's spouse and the spouse is the sole  beneficiary of the employee, the amount of the periodic payment payable  to the spouse would not violate the MDIB requirement if it was 100  percent of the annuity payment payable to the employee, regardless of  the difference in the ages between the employee and the employee's  spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Joint and survivor annuity, nonspouse beneficiary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Explanation of rule. If distributions commence under a distribution  option that is in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint  lives of the employee and a beneficiary other than the employee's  spouse, the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement will not  be satisfied as of the date distributions commence unless under the  distribution option, the annuity payments to be made on and after the  employee's required beginning date will satisfy the conditions of this  paragraph (c). The periodic annuity payment payable to the survivor must  not at any time on   and after the employee's required beginning date exceed the applicable  percentage of the annuity payment payable to the employee using the  table in paragraph (c)(2) of this A-2. The applicable percentage is  based on the adjusted employee/beneficiary age difference. The adjusted  employee/beneficiary age difference is determined by first calculating  the excess of the age of the employee over the age of the beneficiary  based on their ages on their birthdays in a calendar year. Then, if the  employee is younger than age 70, the age difference determined in the  previous sentence is reduced by the number of years that the employee is  younger than age 70 on the employee's birthday in the calendar year that  contains the annuity starting date. In the case of an annuity that  provides for increasing payments, the requirement of this paragraph (c)  will not be violated merely because benefit payments to the beneficiary  increase, provided the increase is determined in the same manner for the  employee and the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Table.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Applicable</p><p class="depth0">Adjusted employee/beneficiary age difference          percentage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10 years or less..........................................           100 11........................................................            96 12........................................................            93 13........................................................            90 14........................................................            87 15........................................................            84 16........................................................            82 17........................................................            79 18........................................................            77 19........................................................            75 20........................................................            73 21........................................................            72 22........................................................            70 23........................................................            68 24........................................................            67 25........................................................            66 26........................................................            64 27........................................................            63 28........................................................            62 29........................................................            61 30........................................................            60 31........................................................            59 32........................................................            59 33........................................................            58 34........................................................            57 35........................................................            56 36........................................................            56 37........................................................            55 38........................................................            55 39........................................................            54 40........................................................            54 41........................................................            53 42........................................................            53 43........................................................            53 44 and greater............................................            52 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. This paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Distributions commence on January 1, 2003 to an employee  (Z), born March 1, 1937, after retirement at age 65. Z's daughter (Y),  born February 5, 1967, is Z's beneficiary. The distributions are in the  form of a joint and survivor annuity for the lives of Z and Y with  payments of $500 a month to Z and upon Z's death of $500 a month to Y,  i.e., the projected monthly payment to Y is 100 percent of the monthly  amount payable to Z. Accordingly, under A-10 of this section, compliance  with the rules of this section is determined as of the annuity starting  date. The adjusted employee/beneficiary age difference is calculated by  taking the excess of the employee's age over the beneficiary's age and  subtracting the number of years the employee is younger than age 70. In  this case, Z is 30 years older than Y and is commencing benefit 4 years  before attaining age 70 so the adjusted employee-beneficiary age  difference is 26 years. Under the table in the paragraph (c)(2) of this  A-2, the applicable percentage for a 26-year adjusted employee/ beneficiary age difference is 64 percent. As of January 1, 2003 (the  annuity starting date) the plan does not satisfy the MDIB requirement  because, as of such date, the distribution option provides that, as of  Z's required beginning date, the monthly payment to Y upon Z's death  will exceed 66 percent of Z's monthly payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Period certain and annuity features. If a distribution form  includes a period certain, the amount of the annuity payments payable to  the beneficiary need not be reduced during the period certain, but in  the case of a joint and survivor annuity with a period certain, the  amount of the annuity payments payable to the beneficiary must satisfy  paragraph (c) of this A-2 after the expiration of the period certain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> of this  section, the benefits (including the   ancillary death benefit) must be distributed in accordance with the  incidental benefit requirement described in Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(i) and  the benefits (excluding the ancillary death benefit) must also satisfy  the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of this A-2.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. How long is a period certain under a defined benefit plan  permitted to extend?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. (a) Distributions commencing during the employee's life.

See A- 10 of this section for the rule for annuity payments with an annuity  starting date before the required beginning date. However, if the  employee's sole beneficiary is the employee's spouse, the period certain  is permitted to be as long as the joint life and last survivor  expectancy of the employee and the employee's spouse, if longer than the  applicable distribution period for the employee, provided the period  certain is not provided in conjunction with a life annuity under A-1(b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Distributions commencing after the employee's death. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If  annuity distributions commence after the death of the employee under the  life expectancy rule (under section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii) or (iv)), the  period certain for any distributions commencing after death cannot  exceed the applicable distribution period determined under A-5(b) of  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 for the distribution calendar year that contains the  annuity starting date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the annuity starting date is in a calendar year before the  first distribution calendar year, the period certain may not exceed the  life expectancy of the designated beneficiary using the beneficiary's  age in the year that contains the annuity starting date.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4.

If the annuity contract is purchased after the required  beginning date, the first payment interval must begin on or before the  purchase date and the payment required for one payment interval must be  made no later than the end of such payment interval.

In order for any of an employee's accrued benefit to be  nonforfeitable as required under section 411, a defined benefit plan  must make an actuarial adjustment to an accrued benefit, the payment of  which is deferred past normal retirement age. The only exception to this  rule is that generally no   actuarial adjustment is required to reflect the period during which a  benefit is suspended as permitted under section 203(a)(3)(B) of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (88 Stat. 829).  The actuarial increase required under section 401(a)(9)(C)(iii) for the  period described in A-7 of this section is generally the same as, and  not in addition to, the actuarial increase required for the same period  under section 411 to reflect any delay in the payment of retirement  benefits after normal retirement age. However, unlike the actuarial  increase required under section 411, the actuarial increase required  under section 401(a)(9)(C)(iii) must be provided even during any period  during which an employee's benefit has been suspended in accordance with  ERISA section 203(a)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Q-10.

(a) General rule. If distributions commence to an employee on  a date before the employee's required beginning date over a period  permitted under section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii) and the distribution form is an  annuity under which distributions are made in accordance with the  provisions of A-1 of this section, the annuity starting date will be  treated as the required beginning date for purposes of applying the  rules of this section and Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2. Thus, for example, the  designated beneficiary distributions will be determined as of the  annuity starting date. Similarly, if the employee dies after the annuity  starting date but before the required beginning date determined under A- 2 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2, after the employee's death, the remaining  portion of the employee's interest must continue to be distributed in  accordance with this section over the remaining period over which  distributions commenced.

Consequently, in such case, A-5 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 and section  401(a)(9)(B)(ii) and (iii) will not apply upon the death of the  surviving spouse as though the surviving spouse were the employee.

In the case of an annuity contract under an individual account  plan that has not yet been annuitized, how   is section 401(a)(9) satisfied with respect to the employee's or  beneficiary's entire interest under the annuity contract for the period  prior to the date annuity payments so commence?</p><p class="depth0">A-12. (a) General rule. Prior to the date that an annuity contract  under an individual account plan is annuitized, the interest of an  employee or beneficiary under that contract is treated as an individual  account for purposes of section 401(a)(9). Thus, the required minimum  distribution for any year with respect to that interest is determined  under Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 rather than this section. See A-1(e) of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5 for rules relating to the satisfaction of section  401(a)(9) in the year that annuity payments commence, A-3(d) of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5 for rules relating to qualifying longevity annuity  contracts (QLACs), defined in A-17 of this section, and A-2(a)(3) of  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-8 for rules relating to the purchase of an annuity  contract with a portion of an employee's account balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Entire interest. For purposes of applying the rules in Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5, the entire interest under the annuity contract as of  December 31 of the relevant valuation calendar year is treated as the  account balance for the valuation calendar year described in A-3 of  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5. The entire interest under an annuity contract is  the dollar amount credited to the employee or beneficiary under the  contract plus the actuarial present value of any additional benefits  (such as survivor benefits in excess of the dollar amount credited to  the employee or beneficiary) that will be provided under the contract.  However, paragraph (c) of this A-12 describes certain additional  benefits that may be disregarded in determining the employee's entire  interest under the annuity contract. The actuarial present value of any  additional benefits described under this A-12 is to be determined using  reasonable actuarial assumptions, including reasonable assumptions as to  future distributions, and without regard to an individual's health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exclusions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The actuarial present value of any additional  benefits provided under an annuity contract described in paragraph (b)  of this A-12 may be disregarded if the sum of the dollar amount credited  to the employee or beneficiary under the contract and the actuarial  present value of the additional benefits is no more than 120 percent of  the dollar amount credited to the employee or beneficiary under the  contract and the contract provides only for the following additional  benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Additional benefits that, in the case of a distribution, are  reduced by an amount sufficient to ensure that the ratio of such sum to  the dollar amount credited does not increase as a result of the  distribution, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An additional benefit that is the right to receive a final  payment upon death that does not exceed the excess of the premiums paid  less the amount of prior distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the only additional benefit provided under the contract is  the additional benefit described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this A-12,  the additional benefit may be disregarded regardless of its value in  relation to the dollar amount credited to the employee or beneficiary  under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance  published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of  this chapter) may provide additional guidance on additional benefits  that may be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples, which use a 5 percent interest  rate and the Mortality Table provided in Rev.

Contract S provides a death benefit until the end of the  calendar year in which the owner attains the age of 84 equal to the  greater of the current Contract S notional account value (dollar amount  credited to G under the contract) and the largest notional account value  at any previous policy anniversary reduced proportionally for subsequent  partial distributions (High Water Mark). Contract S provides a death  benefit in calendar years after the calendar year in which the owner  attains age 84 equal to the current notional account value. Contract S  provides that assets within the contract may be invested in a Fixed  Account at a guaranteed rate of 2 percent. Contract S provides no other  additional benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the end of 2008, when G has an attained age of 78 and 9  months the notional account value of Contract S (after the distribution  for 2008 of 4.93% of the notional account value as of December 31, 2007)  is $550,000, and the High Water Mark, before adjustment for any  withdrawals from Contract S in 2008 is $1,000,000. Thus, Contract S will  provide additional benefits (i.e. the death benefits in excess of the  notional account value) through 2014, the year S turns 84. The actuarial  present value of these additional benefits at the end of 2008 is  determined to be $84,300 (15 percent of the notional account value). In  making this determination, the following assumptions are made: on the  average, deaths occur mid-year; the investment return on his notional  account value is 2 percent per annum; and minimum required distributions  (determined without regard to additional benefits under the Contract S)  are made at the end of each year. The following table summarizes the  actuarial methodology used in determining the actuarial present value of  the additional benefit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">End-of-year                                     End-of-year</p><p class="depth0">Death benefit     notional         Average      Withdrawal at     notional</p><p class="depth0">Year                  during year   account before     notional       end of year    account after</p><p class="depth0">withdrawal        account                       withdrawal ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2008............................      $1,000,000  ..............  ..............  ..............        $550,000 2009............................     \1\ 950,739    \2\ $561,000    \3\ $555,500     \4\ $28,205         532,795 2010............................         901,983         543,451         538,123          28,492         514,959 2011............................         853,749         525,258         520,109          28,769         496,490 2012............................         806,053         506,419         501,454          29,034         477,385 2013............................         758,916         486,933         482,159          29,287         457,645 2014............................         712,356         466,798         462,222          29,525        437,273 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ $1,000,000 death benefit reduced 4.93 percent for withdrawal during 2008. \2\ Notional account value at end of prior year (after distribution) increased by 2 percent return for year. \3\ Average of $550,000 notional account value at end of prior year (after distribution) and $561,000 notional</p><p class="depth0">account value at end of current year (before distribution). \4\ December 31, 2008 notional account (before distribution) divided by uniform lifetime table age 79 factor of</p><p class="depth0">19.5.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Discounted</p><p class="depth0">Survivorship      Interest     Mortality rate    additional</p><p class="depth0">Year                          to start of     discount to     during year      benefits</p><p class="depth0">year         end of 2008                     within year ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2008............................................ 2009............................................         1.00000          .97590      \5\ .04426          17,070 2010............................................          .95574      \6\ .92943          .04946      \7\ 15,987 2011............................................      \8\ .90847          .88517          .05519          14,807 2012............................................          .85833          .84302          .06146          13,546 2013............................................          .80558          .80288          .06788          12,150 2014............................................          .75090          .76464          .07477          10,739</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">..............  ..............  ..............        $84,300 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ One-quarter age 78 rate plus three-quarters age 79 rate. \6\ Five percent discounted 18 months (1.05+(-1.5)). \7\ Blended age 79/age 80 mortality rate (.04946) multiplied by the $363,860 excess of death benefit over the</p><p class="depth0">average notional account value (901,983 less 538,123) multiplied by .95574 probability of survivorship to the</p><p class="depth0">start of 2010 multiplied by 18 month interest discount of .92943. \8\ Survivorship to start of preceding year (.95574) multiplied by probability of survivorship during prior year</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1-.04946)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because Contract S provides that, in the case of a  distribution, the value of the additional death benefit (which is the  only additional benefit available under the contract) is reduced by an  amount that is at least proportional to the reduction in the notional  account value and, at age 78 and 9 months, the sum of the notional  account value (dollar amount credited to the employee under the  contract) and the actuarial present value of the additional death  benefit is no more than 120 percent of the notional account value, the  exclusion under paragraph (c)(2) of this A-12 is applicable for 2009.

Paragraph (c) of this A-14 is illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Variable annuity. A retired participant (Z1) in defined  contribution plan X attains age 70 on March 5, 2005, and thus, attains  age 70\1/2\ in 2005. Z1 elects to purchase annuity Contract Y1 from  Insurance Company W in 2005. Contract Y1 is a single life annuity  contract with a 10-year period certain. Contract Y1 provides for an  initial annual payment calculated with an assumed interest rate (AIR) of  3 percent. Subsequent payments are determined by multiplying the prior  year's payment by a fraction the numerator of which is 1 plus the actual  return on the separate account assets underlying Contract Y1 since the  preceding payment and the denominator of which is 1 plus the AIR during  that period. The value of Z1's account balance in Plan X at the time of  purchase is $105,000, and the purchase price of Contract Y1 is $105,000.  Contract Y1 provides Z1 with an initial payment of $7,200 at the time of  purchase in 2005. The total future expected payments to Z1 under  Contract Y1 are $122,400, calculated as the initial payment of $7,200  multiplied by the age 70 life expectancy of 17 provided in the Single  Life Table in A-1 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-9. Because the total future  expected payments on the purchase date exceed the total value used to  purchase Contract Y1 and payments may only increase as a result of  actuarial gain, with such increases, beginning no later than the next  year, paid in the same form as the payment of the annuity over the  remaining period of the annuity, distributions received by Z1 from  Contract Y1 meet the requirements under paragraph (c)(3) of this A-14.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Participating annuity. A retired participant (Z2) in  defined contribution plan X attains age 70 on May 1, 2005, and thus,  attains age 70\1/2\ in 2005. Z2 elects to purchase annuity Contract Y2  from Insurance Company W in 2005. Contract Y2 is a participating single  life annuity contract with a 10-year period certain. Contract Y2  provides for level annual payments with dividends paid in a lump sum in  the year after the year for which the actuarial experience is measured  or paid out levelly beginning in the year after the year for which the  actuarial gain is measured over the remaining lifetime and period  certain, i.e., the period certain ends at the same time as the original  period certain. Dividends are determined annually by the Board of  Directors of Company W based upon a comparison of actual actuarial  experience to expected actuarial experience in the past year. The value  of Z2's account balance in   Plan X at the time of purchase is $265,000, and the purchase price of  Contract Y2 is $265,000. Contract Y2 provides Z2 with an initial payment  of $16,000 in 2005. The total future expected payments to Z2 under  Contract Y2 are calculated as the annual initial payment of $16,000  multiplied by the age 70 life expectancy of 17 provided in the Single  Life Table in A-1 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-9 for a total of $272,000.  Because the total future expected payments on the purchase date exceeds  the total value used to purchase Contract Y2 and payments may only  increase as a result of actuarial gain, with such increases, beginning  no later than the next year, paid in the same form as the payment of the  annuity over the remaining period of the annuity, distributions received  by Z2 from Contract Y2 meet the requirements under paragraph (c)(3) of  this A-14.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Participating annuity with dividend accumulation. The  facts are the same as in Example 2 except that the annuity provides a  dividend accumulation option under which Z2 may defer receipt of the  dividends to a time selected by Z2.

Neither does the dividend  accumulation option fit within any of the other increases described in  paragraph (c) of this A-14.

Contract Y3 provides Z3 with an initial payment of $6,000 at  the time of purchase in 2005. The total future expected payments to Z3  under Contract Y3 are $120,000, calculated as the initial annual payment  of $6,000 multiplied by the period certain of 20 years. Because the  total future expected payments on the purchase date exceed the total  value used to purchase Contract Y3 and payments only increase as a  constant percentage applied not less frequently than annually,  distributions received by Z3 from Contract Y3 meet the requirements  under paragraph (c)(1) of this A-14.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6.

Contract Y4 provides that Z4 may  cancel Contract Y4 at any time before Z4 attains age 84, and receive, on  his next payment due date, a final payment in an amount determined by  multiplying the initial payment amount by a factor obtained from Table M  of Contract Y4 using the Y4's age as of Y4's birthday in the calendar  year of the final payment. The value of Z4's account balance in Plan X  at the time of purchase is $450,000, and the purchase price of Contract  Y4 is $450,000.

Because the total future expected payments on  the purchase date exceed the total value being annuitized (i.e., the  $450,000 used to purchase Contract Y4), the permitted increases set  forth in paragraph (c) of this A-14 are available. Furthermore, because  the factors in Table M are less than the life expectancy of each of the  ages in the Single Life Table provided in A-1 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-9,  the final payment is always less than the total future expected  payments.

The total future expected payments under Contract Y4 at age 84  before the final payment is $324,000, calculated as the initial payment  amount multiplied by 8.1, the age 84 life expectancy provided in the  Single Life Table in A-1 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-9. Because $320,000 (the  total future expected payments under the annuity contract, including the  amount of the final payment) is less than $324,000 (the total future  expected payments under the annuity contract, determined before the  election), the final payment is an acceleration of payments within the  meaning of paragraph (c)(4) of this A-14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts  are the same as in Example 7 except that the annuity provides Z4 may  request, at any time before Z4 attains age 84, an ad hoc payment on his  next payment due date with future payments reduced by an amount equal to  the ad hoc payment divided by the factor obtained from Table M (from  Example 7) corresponding to Z4's age at the time of the ad hoc payment.  Because, at each age, the factors in Table M are less than the  corresponding life expectancies in the Single Life Table in A-1 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-9, total future expected payments under Contract Y4 will  decrease after an ad hoc payment. Thus, ad hoc distributions received by  Z4 from Contract Y4 will satisfy the requirements under paragraph (c)(4)  of this A-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As an illustration of paragraph (i) of this Example 8, if Z4  were to request, on the day before he was to attain age 84, an ad hoc  payment of $100,000 on his next payment due date, his recalculated  annual payment amount would be reduced to $27,500. This amount is  determined as $40,000 (the amount of Z4's next annual payment) reduced  by $12,500 (his $100,000 ad hoc payment divided by the Table M factor at  age 84 of 8.0). Thus, Z4's total future expected payments after the ad  hoc payment (and including the ad hoc payment) are equal to $322,750  ($100,000 plus $27,500 multiplied by the Single Life Table value of  8.1).

Contract Y5 provides for  an initial payment of $200,000, a second payment one year from the time  of purchase of $40,000, and 18 succeeding annual payments each  increasing at a constant percentage rate of 4.5 percent from the  preceding payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contract Y5 fails to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(9)  because the total future expected payments without regard to any  increases in the annuity payment, calculated as $200,000 in year one and  $40,000 in each of years two through twenty, is only $960,000 (i.e., an  amount that does not exceed the total value used to purchase the  annuity).</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: Are there special rules applicable to payments made under a  defined benefit plan or annuity contract to a surviving child?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: Yes, pursuant to section 401(a)(9)(F), payments under a  defined benefit plan or annuity contract that are made to an employee's  child until such child reaches the age of majority (or dies, if earlier)  may be treated, for purposes of section 401(a)(9), as if such payments  were made to the surviving spouse to the extent they become payable to  the surviving spouse upon cessation of the payments to the child. For  purposes of the preceding sentence, a child may be treated as having not  reached the age of majority if the child has not completed a specified  course of   education and is under the age of 26. In addition, a child who is  disabled within the meaning of section 72(m)(7) when the child reaches  the age of majority may be treated as having not reached the age of  majority so long as the child continues to be disabled. Thus, when  payments described in this paragraph A-15 become payable to the  surviving spouse because the child attains the age of majority, recovers  from a disabling illness, dies, or completes a specified course of  education, there is not an increase in benefits under A-1 of this  section.

No, if an amount is distributed by one plan and is rolled over  to another plan, the amount distributed is still treated as a  distribution by the distributing plan for purposes of section 401(a)(9),  notwithstanding the rollover. See A-1 of Sec. 1.402(c)-2 for the  definition of a rollover and A-7 of Sec. 1.402(c)-2 for rules for  determining the portion of any distribution that is not eligible for  rollover because it is a required minimum distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. If an amount is distributed by one plan (distributing plan) and  is rolled over to another plan (receiving plan), how are the benefit and  the required minimum distribution under the receiving plan affected?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. If an amount is distributed by one plan (distributing plan) and  is rolled over to another plan (receiving plan), the benefit of the  employee under the receiving plan is increased by the amount rolled over  for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution for the  calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the  amount rolled over is distributed. If the amount rolled over is received  after the last valuation date in the calendar year under the receiving  plan, the benefit of the employee as of such valuation date, adjusted in  accordance with A-3 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5, will be increased by the  rollover amount valued as of the date of receipt.

In the case of a transfer of an amount of an employee's benefit  from one plan (transferor plan) to another plan (transferee plan), are  there any special rules for satisfying section 401(a)(9) or determining  the employee's benefit under the transferor plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. (a) In the case of a transfer of an amount of an employee's  benefit from one plan (transferor plan) to another (transferee plan),  the transfer is not treated as a distribution by the transferor plan for  purposes of section 401(a)(9). Instead, the benefit of the employee  under the transferor plan is decreased by the amount transferred.  However, if any portion of an employee's benefit is transferred in a  distribution calendar year with respect to that employee, in order to  satisfy section 401(a)(9), the transferor plan must determine the amount  of the required minimum distribution with respect to that employee for  the calendar year of the transfer using the employee's benefit under the  transferor plan before the transfer. Additionally, if any portion of an  employee's benefit is transferred in the employee's second distribution  calendar year but on or before the employee's required beginning date,  in order to satisfy section 401(a)(9), the transferor plan must  determine the amount of the minimum distribution requirement for the  employee's first distribution calendar year based on the employee's  benefit under the transferor plan before the transfer. The transferor  plan may satisfy the minimum distribution requirement for the calendar  year of the transfer (and the prior year if applicable) by segregating  the amount which   must be distributed from the employee's benefit and not transferring  that amount. Such amount may be retained by the transferor plan and must  be distributed on or before the date required under section 401(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of determining any required minimum distribution  for the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which  the transfer occurs, in the case of a transfer after the last valuation  date for the calendar year of the transfer under the transferor plan,  the benefit of the employee as of such valuation date, adjusted in  accordance with A-3 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5, will be decreased by the  amount transferred, valued as of the date of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4.

For purposes of determining an employee's benefit and required  minimum distribution under section 401(a)(9), a spinoff, a merger, or a  consolidation (as defined in Sec. 1.414(l)-1) will be treated as a  transfer of the benefits of the employees involved. Consequently, the  benefit and required minimum distribution of each employee involved  under the transferor and transferee plans will be determined in  accordance with A-3 and A-4 of this section.

What distribution rules apply if an employee is a participant  in more than one plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. If an employee is a participant in more than one plan, the  plans in which the employee participates are not permitted to be  aggregated for purposes of testing whether the distribution requirements  of section 401(a)(9) are met. The distribution of the benefit of the  employee under each plan must separately meet the requirements of  section 401(a)(9). For this purpose, a plan described in section 414(k)  is treated as two separate plans, a defined contribution plan to the  extent benefits are based on an individual account and a defined benefit  plan with respect to the remaining benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. If an employee's benefit under a defined contribution plan is  divided into separate accounts (or under a defined benefit plan is  divided into segregated shares), do the distribution rules in section  401(a)(9) and these regulations apply separately to each separate  account?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided  in this A-2, if an employee's benefit under a defined contribution plan  is divided into separate accounts under the plan, the separate accounts  will be aggregated for purposes of satisfying the rules in section  401(a)(9). Thus, except as otherwise provided in this A-2, all separate  accounts, including a separate account for employee contributions under  section 72(d)(2), will be aggregated for purposes of section 401(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the employee's benefit in a defined contribution plan is  divided into separate accounts and the beneficiaries with respect to one  separate account differ from the beneficiaries with respect to the other  separate accounts of the employee under the plan, for years subsequent  to the calendar year containing the date as of which the separate  accounts were established, or date of death if later, such separate  account under the plan is not aggregated with the other separate  accounts under the plan in order to determine whether the distributions  from such separate account under the plan satisfy section 401(a)(9).  Instead, the rules in section 401(a)(9) separately apply to such  separate account under the plan. However, the applicable distribution  period for   each such separate account is determined disregarding the other  beneficiaries of the employee's benefit only if the separate account is  established on a date no later than the last day of the year following  the calendar year of the employee's death. For example, if, in the case  of a distribution described in section 401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv), the  only beneficiary of a separate account under the plan established on a  date no later than the end of the year following the calendar year of  the employee's death is the employee's surviving spouse, and  beneficiaries other than the surviving spouse are designated with  respect to the other separate accounts with respect to the employee,  distribution of the spouse's separate account under the plan need not  commence until the date determined under the first sentence in A-3(b) of  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3, even if distribution of the other separate accounts  under the plan must commence at an earlier date. Similarly, in the case  of a distribution after the death of an employee to which section  401(a)(9)(B)(i) does not apply, distribution from a separate account of  an employee established on a date no later than the end of the year  following the year of the employee's death may be made over a  beneficiary's life expectancy in accordance with section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv) even though distributions from other separate  accounts under the plan with different beneficiaries are being made in  accordance with the 5-year rule in section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A portion of an employee's account balance under a defined  contribution plan is permitted to be used to purchase an annuity  contract while another portion stays in the account. In that case, the  remaining account under the plan must be distributed in accordance with  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 in order to satisfy section 401(a)(9) and the  annuity payments under the annuity contract must satisfy Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-6 in order to satisfy section 401(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Defined benefit plan.

What are separate accounts for purposes of section 401(a)(9)?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. For purposes of section 401(a)(9), separate accounts in an  employee's account are separate portions of an employee's benefit  reflecting the separate interests of the employee's beneficiaries under  the plan as of the date of the employee's death for which separate  accounting is maintained. The separate accounting must allocate all  post-death investment gains and losses, contributions, and forfeitures,  for the period prior to the establishment of the separate accounts on a  pro rata basis in a reasonable and consistent manner among the separate  accounts. However, once the separate accounts are actually established,  the separate accounting can provide for separate investments for each  separate account under which gains and losses from the investment of the  account are only allocated to that account, or investment gain or losses  can continue to be allocated among the separate accounts on a pro rata  basis. A separate accounting must allocate any post-death distribution  to the separate account of the beneficiary receiving that distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. If a distribution is required to be made to an employee by  section 401(a)(9)(A) or is required to be made to a surviving spouse  under section 401(a)(9)(B), must the distribution be made even if the  employee, or spouse where applicable, fails to consent to a distribution  while a benefit is immediately distributable?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. Yes, section 411(a)(11) and section 417(e) (see Sec. Sec.  1.411(a)(11)-1(c)(2) and 1.417(e)-1(c)) require employee and spousal  consent to certain distributions of plan benefits while such benefits  are immediately distributable. If an employee's normal retirement age is  later than the employee's required beginning date and, therefore,  benefits are still immediately distributable, the plan must,  nevertheless, distribute plan benefits to the employee (or where  applicable, to the spouse) in a manner that satisfies the requirements  of section 401(a)(9). Section 401(a)(9) must be satisfied even though  the employee (or spouse, where applicable) fails to consent to the  distribution. In such a case, the plan may distribute in the form of a  qualified joint and survivor annuity   (QJSA) or in the form of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity  (QPSA), as applicable, and the consent requirements of sections  411(a)(11) and 417(e) are deemed to be satisfied if the plan has made  reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the employee (or spouse if  applicable) and if the distribution otherwise meets the requirements of  section 417. If, because of section 401(a)(11)(B), the plan is not  required to distribute in the form of a QJSA to an employee or a QPSA to  a surviving spouse, the plan may distribute the required minimum  distribution amount to satisfy section 401(a)(9) and the consent  requirements of sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e) are deemed to be  satisfied if the plan has made reasonable efforts to obtain consent from  the employee (or spouse if applicable) and if the distribution otherwise  meets the requirements of section 417.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5.

Except as otherwise provided in A-6(a) of this section (in the  case of distributions of a portion of an employee's benefit payable to a  former spouse of an employee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations  order), for purposes of section 401(a)(9), an individual is a spouse or  surviving spouse of an employee if such individual is treated as the  employee's spouse under applicable state law. In the case of  distributions after the death of an employee, for purposes of  determining whether, under the life expectancy rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv), the provisions of section 401(a)(9)(B)(iv)  apply, the spouse of the employee is determined as of the date of death  of the employee.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. In order to satisfy section 401(a)(9), are there any special  rules which apply to the distribution of all or a portion of an  employee's benefit payable to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified  domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p) (QDRO)?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. (a) A former spouse to whom all or a portion of the employee's  benefit is payable pursuant to a QDRO will be treated as a spouse  (including a surviving spouse) of the employee for purposes of section  401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental benefit  requirement, regardless of whether the QDRO specifically provides that  the former spouse is treated as the spouse for purposes of sections  401(a)(11) and 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a QDRO provides that an employee's benefit is to be  divided and a portion is to be allocated to an alternate payee, such  portion will be treated as a separate account (or segregated share)  which separately must satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(9) and  may not be aggregated with other separate accounts (or segregated  shares) of the employee for purposes of satisfying section 401(a)(9).  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-6,  distribution of such separate account allocated to an alternate payee  pursuant to a QDRO must be made in accordance with section 401(a)(9).  For example, in general, distribution of such account will satisfy  section 401(a)(9)(A) if required minimum distributions from such account  during the employee's lifetime begin not later than the employee's  required beginning date and the required minimum distribution is  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 for each distribution  calendar year (using an applicable distribution period determined under  A-4 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 for the employee in the distribution calendar  year either using the Uniform Lifetime Table in A-2 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-9 or using the joint life expectancy of the employee and a  spousal alternate payee in the distribution calendar year if the spousal  alternate payee is more than 10 years younger than the employee). The  determination of whether distribution from such account after the death  of the employee to the alternate payee will be made in accordance with  section 401(a)(9)(B)(i) or section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii) or (iii) and (iv)  will depend on whether distributions have begun as determined under A-6  of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2 (which provides, in general, that distributions  are not treated as having begun until the employee's required beginning  date even though payments may actually have begun before that date). For  example, if the alternate payee dies before the employee and  distribution of the separate account allocated to the alternate payee  pursuant to the QDRO is to be made to the alternate payee's beneficiary,  such   beneficiary may be treated as a designated beneficiary for purposes of  determining the minimum distribution required from such account after  the death of the employee if the beneficiary of the alternate payee is  an individual and if such beneficiary is a beneficiary under the plan or  specified to or in the plan. Specification in or pursuant to the QDRO is  treated as specification to the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distribution of the separate account allocated to an alternate  payee pursuant to a QDRO will satisfy the requirements of section  401(a)(9)(A)(ii) if such account is to be distributed, beginning not  later than the employee's required beginning date, over the life of the  alternate payee (or over a period not extending beyond the life  expectancy of the alternate payee). Also, if the plan permits the  employee to elect whether distribution upon the death of the employee  will be made in accordance with the 5-year rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(ii) or the life expectancy rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv) pursuant to A-4(c) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3,  such election is to be made only by the alternate payee for purposes of  distributing the separate account allocated to the alternate payee  pursuant to the QDRO. If the alternate payee dies after distribution of  the separate account allocated to the alternate payee pursuant to a QDRO  has begun (determined under A-6 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2) but before the  employee dies, distribution of the remaining portion of that portion of  the benefit allocated to the alternate payee must be made in accordance  with the rules in Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 or 1.401(a)(9)-6 for distributions  during the life of the employee.

A plan will not fail to satisfy section 401(a)(9) merely  because it fails to distribute an amount otherwise required to be  distributed by section 401(a)(9) during the period in which the issue of  whether a domestic relations order is a QDRO is being determined  pursuant to section 414(p)(7), provided that the period does not extend  beyond the 18-month period described in section 414(p)(7)(E). To the  extent that a distribution otherwise required under section 401(a)(9) is  not made during this period, any segregated amounts, as defined in  section 414(p)(7)(A), will be treated as though the amounts are not  vested during the period and any distributions with respect to such  amounts must be made under the relevant rules for nonvested benefits  described in either A-8 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 or A-6 of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-6, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8.

Will a payment by a plan after the death of an employee fail  to be treated as a distribution for purposes of section 401(a)(9) solely  because it is made to an estate or a trust?</p><p class="depth0">A-11. A payment by a plan after the death of an employee will not  fail to be treated as a distribution for purposes of section 401(a)(9)  solely because it is made to an estate or a trust. As a result, the  estate or trust which receives a payment from a plan after the death of  an employee need not distribute the amount of such payment to the  beneficiaries of the estate or trust in accordance with section  401(a)(9)(B). Pursuant to A-3 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-4, an estate may not  be a designated beneficiary. Thus, pursuant to A-4 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)- 3, distribution to the estate must satisfy the 5-year rule in section  401(a)(9)(B)(iii) if the distribution to the employee had not begun (as  defined in A-6 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2) as of the employee's date of  death.

[T.D. 8987, 67 FR 18994, Apr. 17, 2002; 67 FR 36676, May 24, 2002]    Sec. 1.401(a)(17)-1  Limitation on annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Compensation limit requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In order to be a  qualified plan, a plan must satisfy section 401(a)(17). Section  401(a)(17) provides an annual compensation limit for each employee under  a qualified plan. This limit applies to a qualified plan in two ways.  First, a plan may not base allocations, in the case of a defined  contribution plan, or benefit accruals, in the case of a defined benefit  plan, on compensation in excess of the annual compensation limit.  Second, the amount of an employee's annual compensation that may be  taken into account in applying certain specified nondiscrimination rules  under the Internal Revenue Code is subject to the annual compensation  limit. These two limitations are set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section, respectively. Paragraph (d) of this section provides the  effective dates of section 401(a)(17), the amendments made by section  13212 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), and  this section. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for  determining post-effective-date accrued benefits under the fresh-start  rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual compensation limit for plan years beginning before  January 1, 1994. For purposes of this section, for plan years beginning  prior to the OBRA '93 effective date, annual compensation limit means  $200,000, adjusted as provided by the Commissioner. The amount of the  annual compensation limit is adjusted at the same time and in the same  manner as under section 415(d). The base period for the annual  adjustment is the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1988, and the  first adjustment is effective on January 1, 1990. Any increase in the  annual compensation limit is effective as of January 1 of a calendar  year and applies to any plan year beginning in that calendar year. In  any plan year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date, if  compensation for any plan year beginning prior to the statutory  effective date is used for determining allocations or benefit accruals,  or when applying any nondiscrimination rule, then the annual  compensation limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the  statutory effective date (generally $200,000) must be applied to  compensation for that prior plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Annual compensation limit for plan years beginning on or after  January 1, 1994--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, for plan  years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, annual  compensation limit means $150,000, adjusted as provided by the  Commissioner. The adjusted dollar amount of the annual compensation  limit is determined by adjusting the $150,000 amount for changes in the  cost of living as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section and  rounding this adjusted dollar amount as provided in paragraph  (a)(3)(iii) of this section. Any increase in the annual compensation  limit is effective as of January 1 of a calendar year and applies to any  plan year beginning in that calendar year. For example, if a plan has a  plan year beginning July 1, 1994, and ending June 30, 1995, the annual  compensation limit in effect on January 1, 1994 ($150,000), applies to  the plan for the entire plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cost of living adjustment. The $150,000 amount is adjusted for  changes in the cost of living by the Commissioner at the same time and  in the same manner as under section 415(d). The base period for the  annual adjustment is the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rounding of adjusted compensation limit. After the $150,000,  adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section,  exceeds the annual compensation limit for the prior calendar year by  $10,000 or more, the annual compensation limit will be increased by the  amount of such excess, rounded down to the next lowest multiple of  $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional guidance. The Commissioner may, in revenue rulings  and procedures, notices, and other guidance, published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter),  provide any additional guidance that may be necessary or appropriate  concerning the annual limits on compensation under section 401(a)(17).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plan limit on compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A plan does not  satisfy section 401(a)(17) unless it provides that the compensation  taken into account for any employee in determining plan allocations or  benefit accruals for any plan year is limited to the annual compensation  limit. For purposes of this rule, allocations and benefit accruals under  a plan include all benefits provided under the plan, including ancillary  benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement. For purposes of this  paragraph (b), the limit in effect for the current plan year applies  only to the compensation for that year that is taken into account in  determining plan allocations or benefit accruals for the year. The  compensation for any prior plan year taken into account in determining  an employee's allocations or benefit accruals for the current plan year  is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for  that prior year. Thus, increases in the annual compensation limit apply  only to compensation taken into account for the plan year in which the  increase is effective. In addition, if compensation for any plan year  beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used for determining  allocations or benefit accruals in a plan year beginning on or after the  OBRA '93 effective date, then the annual compensation limit for that  prior year is the annual compensation limit in effect for the first plan  year beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date (generally  $150,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of limit to a plan year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  purposes of applying this paragraph (b), the annual compensation limit  is applied to the compensation for the plan year on which allocations or  benefit accruals are based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Compensation for the plan year. If a plan determines  compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals for a  plan year based on compensation for the plan year, then the annual  compensation limit that applies to the compensation for the plan year is  the limit in effect for the calendar year in which the plan year begins.  Alternatively, if a plan determines compensation used in determining  allocations or benefit accruals for the plan year on the basis of  compensation for a 12-consecutive-month period, or periods, ending no  later than the last day of the plan year, then the annual compensation  limit applies to compensation for each of those periods based on the  annual compensation limit in effect for the respective calendar year in  which each 12-month period begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Compensation for a period of less than 12-months--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Proration required. If compensation for a period of less than 12 months  is used for a plan year, then the otherwise applicable annual  compensation limit is reduced in the same proportion as the reduction in  the 12-month period. For example, if a defined benefit plan provides  that the accrual for each month in a plan year is separately determined  based on the compensation for that month and the plan year accrual is  the sum of the accruals for all months, then the annual compensation  limit for each month is \1/12\th of the annual compensation limit for  the plan year. In addition, if the period for determining compensation  used in calculating an employee's allocation or accrual for a plan year  is a short plan year (i.e., shorter than 12 months), the annual  compensation   limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation  limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of  months in the short plan year, and the denominator of which is 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No proration required for participation for less than a full  plan year. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a  plan is not treated as using compensation for less than 12 months for a  plan year merely because the plan formula provides that the allocation  or accrual for each employee is based on compensation for the portion of  the plan year during which the employee is a participant in the plan. In  addition, no proration is required merely because an employee is covered  under a plan for less than a full plan year, provided that allocations  or benefit accruals are otherwise determined using compensation for a  period of at least 12 months. Finally, notwithstanding paragraph  (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, no proration is required merely because  the amount of elective contributions (within the meaning of Sec.  1.401(k)-6, matching contributions (within the meaning of Sec.  1.401(m)-5, or employee contributions (within the meaning of Sec.  1.401(m)-5 that is contributed for each pay period during a plan year is  determined separately using compensation for that pay period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limits on multiple employer and multiemployer plans. For  purposes of this paragraph (b), in the case of a plan described in  section 413(c) or 414(f) (a plan maintained by more than one employer),  the annual compensation limit applies separately with respect to the  compensation of an employee from each employer maintaining the plan  instead of applying to the employee's total compensation from all  employers maintaining the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Family aggregation. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan X is a defined benefit plan with a calendar year  plan year and bases benefits on the average of an employee's high 3  consecutive years' compensation. The OBRA '93 effective date for Plan X  is January 1, 1994. Employee A's high 3 consecutive years' compensation  prior to the application of the annual compensation limits is $160,000  (1994), $155,000 (1993), and $135,000 (1992). To satisfy this paragraph  (b), Plan X cannot base plan benefits for Employee A in 1994 on  compensation in excess of $145,000 (the average of $150,000 (A's 1994  compensation capped by the annual compensation limit), $150,000 (A's  1993 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation limit  applicable to all years before 1994), and $135,000 (A's 1992  compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation limit applicable  to all years before 1994)). For purposes of determining the 1994  accrual, each year (1994, 1993, and 1992), not the average of the 3  years, is subject to the 1994 annual compensation limit of $150,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that Employee  A's high 3 consecutive years' compensation prior to the application of  the limits is $185,000 (1997), $175,000 (1996), and $165,000 (1995).  Assume that the annual compensation limit is first adjusted to $160,000  for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1997. Plan X cannot base  plan benefits for Employee A in 1997 on compensation in excess of  $153,333 (the average of $160,000 (A's 1997 compensation capped by the  1997 limit), $150,000 (A's 1996 compensation capped by the 1996 limit),  and $150,000 (A's 1995 compensation capped by the 1995 limit)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan Y is a defined benefit plan that bases benefits on  an employee's high consecutive 36 months of compensation ending within  the plan year. Employee B's high 36 months are the period September 1995  to August 1998, in which Employee B earned $50,000 in each month. Assume  that the annual compensation limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for  plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1997. The annual  compensation limit is $150,000, $150,000, and $160,000 in 1995, 1996,  and 1997, respectively. To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan Y cannot  base Employee B's plan benefits for the 1998 plan year on compensation  in excess of $153,333. This amount is determined by applying the  applicable annual compensation limit to compensation for each of the  three 12-consecutive-month periods. The September 1995 to August 1996  period is capped by the annual compensation limit of $150,000 for 1995;  the September 1996 to August 1997 period is capped by the annual  compensation limit of $150,000 for 1996; and the September 1997 to  August 1998 period is capped by the annual compensation limit of  $160,000 for 1997. The average of these capped amounts is the annual  compensation limit applicable in determining benefits for the 1998 year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>. Employee C and  Employee D are partners of Employer P and thus are self-employed  individuals. Neither Employee C nor Employee D owns an interest in any  other business or is a common-law employee in any business. For the 1994  calendar year, Employee C has net profit from self-employment of  $80,000, and Employee D has net profit from self-employment of $175,000.  The deduction for Employee C under section 164(f) for one-half of self- employment taxes is $4,828. The deduction for Employee D under section  164(f) for one-half of self-employment taxes is $6,101</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The plan year compensation under the plan formula for Employee C  is $75,172 ($80,000 minus $4,828). The allocation of employer  contributions under the plan allocation formula for 1994 for Employee C  is $9,805 ($75,172 (Employee C's plan year compensation for 1994)  multiplied by 13.0435%). The plan year compensation under the plan  formula before application of the annual limit under section 401(a)(17)  for Employee D is $168,899 ($175,000 minus $6101). After application of  the annual limit, the plan year compensation for the 1994 plan year for  Employee D is $150,000 (the annual limit for 1994). Therefore, the  allocation of employer contributions under the plan allocation formula  for 1994 for Employee D is $19,565 ($150,000 (Employee D's plan year  compensation after application of the annual limit for 1994) multiplied  by 13.0435%).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that Plan  Z provides that plan year compensation for self-employed individuals is  defined as earned income within the meaning of section 401(c)(2)  attributable to Employer P. In addition, Plan Z provides for an annual  allocation of employer contributions of 15 percent of plan year  compensation for all employees in the plan, including self-employed  individuals, such as Employees C and D. The net profit from self- employment for Employee C and the net profit from self-employment for  Employee D are the same as provided in Example 4. However, the earned  income of Employee C determined in accordance with section 401(c)(2) is  $65,367 ($80,000 minus $4,828 minus $9,805). The earned income of  Employee D determined in accordance with section 401(c)(2) is $146,869  ($175,000 minus $6,101 minus $22,030). Therefore, the allocation of  employer contributions under the plan allocation formula for 1994 for  Employee C is $9,805 ($65,367 (Employee C's plan year compensation for  1994) multiplied by 15%). Employee D's earned income for 1994 does not  exceed the 1994 annual limit of $150,000. Therefore, the allocation of  employer contributions under the plan allocation formula for 1994 for  Employee D is $22,030 ($146,869 (Employee D's plan year compensation for  1994) multiplied by 15%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limit on compensation for nondiscrimination rules--(1) General  rule. The annual compensation limit applies for purposes of applying the  nondiscrimination rules under sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(5), 401(l),  401(k)(3), 401(m)(2), 403(b)(12), 404(a)(2) and 410(b)(2). The annual  compensation limit also applies in determining whether an alternative  method of determining compensation impermissibly discriminates under  section 414(s)(3). Thus, for example, the annual compensation limit  applies when determining a self-employed individual's total earned  income that is used to determine the equivalent alternative compensation  amount under Sec. 1.414(s)-1(g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. This paragraph (c) provides rules  for applying the annual compensation limit for these purposes. For  purposes of this paragraph (c), compensation means the compensation used  in applying the applicable nondiscrimination rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement. For purposes of this  paragraph (c), when applying an applicable nondiscrimination rule for a  plan year, the compensation for each plan year taken into account is  limited to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that  year, and an employee's compensation for that plan year in excess of the  limit is disregarded. Thus, if the nondiscrimination provision is  applied on the basis of compensation determined over a period of more  than one year (for example, average annual compensation), the annual  compensation limit in effect for each of the plan years that is taken  into account in determining the average applies to the respective plan  year's compensation. In addition, if compensation for any plan   year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used when  applying any nondiscrimination rule in a plan year beginning on or after  the OBRA '93 effective date, then the annual compensation limit for that  prior year is the annual compensation limit for the first plan year  beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date (generally $150,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan-by-plan limit. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the  annual compensation limit applies separately to each plan (or group of  plans treated as a single plan) of an employer for purposes of the  applicable nondiscrimination requirement.

Paragraph  (e)(2) of this section contains definitions used in applying these  rules. Paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section explain the  application of the fresh-start rules in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13 to the  determination of the accrued benefits of section 401(a)(17) employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 401(a)(17) employee. An employee is a section 401(a)(17)  employee as of a date, on or after the statutory effective date, if the  employee's current accrued benefit as of that date is based on  compensation for a year prior to the statutory effective date that  exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year beginning  on or after the statutory effective date. In addition, an employee is a  section 401(a)(17) employee as of a date, on or after the OBRA '93  effective date, if the employee's current accrued benefit as of that  date is based on compensation for a year prior to the OBRA '93 effective  date that exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year  beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date. For this purpose, a  current accrued benefit is not treated as based on compensation that  exceeded the relevant annual compensation limit, if a plan makes a fresh  start using the formula with wear-away described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 13(c)(4)(ii), and the employee's accrued benefit determined under Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(4)(ii)(B), taking into account the annual compensation  limit, exceeds the employee's frozen accrued benefit (or, if applicable,  the employee's adjusted accrued benefit) as of the fresh-start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date. Section 401(a)(17) fresh- start date means a fresh-start date as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12  not earlier than the last day of the last plan year beginning before the  statutory effective date, and not later than the last day of the last  plan year beginning before the effective date of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> OBRA '93 fresh-start date. OBRA '93 fresh-start date means a  fresh-start date as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12 not earlier than the  last day of the last plan year beginning before the OBRA '93 effective  date, and not later than the last day of the last plan year beginning  before the effective date of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit. Section 401(a)(17)  frozen accrued benefit means the accrued benefit for any section  401(a)(17) employee frozen (as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3)(i))  as of the last day of the last plan year beginning before the statutory  effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit. OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit  means the accrued benefit for any section 401(a)(17) employee frozen (as  defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3)(i)) as of the OBRA '93 fresh-start  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of fresh-start rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. In order to  satisfy section 401(a)(17), a defined benefit plan must determine the  accrued benefit of each section 401(a)(17) employee by applying the  fresh-start rules in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c). The fresh-start rules must  be applied using a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date and using the  plan benefit formula, after amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17)  and this section, as the formula applicable to benefit accruals in the  current plan year. In addition, the fresh-start rules must be applied to  determine the accrued benefit of each section 401(a)(17) employee using  an OBRA '93 fresh-start date and using the plan benefit formula, after  amendment to comply with the reduction in the section 401(a)(17) annual   compensation limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as the  formula applicable to benefit accruals in the current plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>. Thus, the  consistency rules of those sections govern, unless otherwise provided.  For example, if the plan is using a fresh-start date applicable to all  employees and is not adjusting frozen accrued benefits under Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) for employees who are not section 401(a)(17)  employees, then the frozen accrued benefits for section 401(a)(17)  employees may not be adjusted under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) or this  paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination of adjusted accrued benefit. If the fresh-start  rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c) and (d) are applied to determine the  benefits of all employees after a fresh-start date, the plan will not  fail to satisfy the consistency requirement of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 13(c)(5)(i) merely because the plan makes the adjustment described in  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) to the frozen accrued benefits of employees who  are not section 401(a)(17) employees, but does not make the adjustment  to the frozen accrued benefits of section 401(a)(17) employees. In  addition, the plan does not fail to satisfy the consistency requirement  of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(5)(i) merely because the plan makes the  adjustment described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) for section 401(a)(17)  employees on the basis of the compensation formula that was used to  determine the frozen accrued benefit (as required under paragraph  (e)(4)(iii) of this section) but makes the adjustment for employees who  are not section 401(a)(17) employees on the basis of any other method  provided in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Permitted adjustments to frozen accrued benefit of section  401(a)(17) employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in  paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the rules in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3) (permitting certain adjustments to frozen accrued  benefits) apply to section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefits or OBRA  '93 frozen accrued benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Optional forms of benefit. After either the section 401(a)(17)  fresh-start date or the OBRA '93 fresh-start date, a plan may be amended  either to provide a new optional form of benefit or to make an optional  form of benefit available with respect to the section 401(a)(17) frozen  accrued benefit or the OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit, provided that  the optional form of benefit is not subsidized. Whether an optional form  is subsidized may be determined using any reasonable actuarial  assumptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjusting section 401(a)(17) accrued benefits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  If the plan adjusts accrued benefits for employees under the rules of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) as of a fresh-start date, the adjusted accrued  benefit (within the meaning of section Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)) for each  section 401(a)(17) employee must be determined after the fresh-start  date by reference to the plan's compensation formula that was actually  used to determine the frozen accrued benefit as of the fresh-start date.  For this purpose, the plan's compensation formula incorporates the  plan's underlying compensation definition and compensation averaging  period. In making the adjustment, the denominator of the adjustment  fraction described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i) is the employee's  compensation as of the fresh-start date using the plan's compensation  formula as of that date and, in the case of an OBRA '93 fresh-start  date, reflecting the annual compensation limits that applied as of the  fresh-start date. The numerator of the adjustment fraction is the  employee's updated compensation (i.e., compensation for the current plan  year within the meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)), determined after  applying the annual compensation limits to each year's compensation that  is used in the plan's compensation formula as of the fresh-start date.  Similarly, in applying the alternative rule in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 13(d)(8)(v), the updated compensation that is substituted must be  determined after applying the annual compensation limits to each year's  compensation that is used in the plan's compensation formula. Thus, no  adjustment will be permitted unless the updated compensation (determined  after   applying the annual compensation limit) exceeds the compensation that  was used to determine the employee's frozen accrued benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Multiple fresh starts. If a plan makes more than one fresh start  with respect to a section 401(a)(17) employee, the employee's frozen  accrued benefit as of the latest fresh-start date will either be  determined by applying the current benefit formula to the employee's  total years of service as of that fresh-start date or will consist of  the sum of the employee's frozen accrued benefit (or adjusted accrued  benefit (as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i))) as of the  previous fresh-start date plus additional frozen accruals since the  previous fresh start. If the frozen accrued benefit consists of such a  sum, in making the adjustments described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of  this section, separate adjustments must be made to that previously  frozen accrued benefit (or adjusted accrued benefit) and the additional  frozen accruals to the extent that the frozen accrued benefit and the  additional accruals have been determined using different compensation  formulas or different compensation limits (i.e., the section 401(a)(17)  limit before and after the reduction in limit described in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section). In this case, if the plan is applying the  adjustment fraction of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i), the denominator of  the separate adjustment fraction for adjusting each portion of the  frozen accrued benefit must reflect the actual compensation formula,  and, if applicable, compensation limit, originally used for determining  that portion. For example, the frozen accrued benefit of a section  401(a)(17) employee as of the OBRA '93 fresh-start date may be based on  the sum of the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit (determined  without any annual compensation limit) plus benefit accruals in the  years between the statutory effective date and the OBRA '93 effective  date (based on compensation that was subject to the annual compensation  limits for those years). In this example, in adjusting the section  401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit, the denominator of the adjustment  fraction does not reflect any annual compensation limit. Similarly, in  adjusting the frozen accruals for years between the statutory effective  date and the OBRA '93 effective date, the denominator of the adjustment  fraction reflects the level of the annual compensation limit in effect  for those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this  paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(17)</em> employees, the employee's accrued benefit is the greater of</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The employee's benefit under the plan's benefit formula (after  the plan formula is amended to comply with section 401(a)(17)) as  applied to the employee's total years of service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employee's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988,  determined as though the employee terminated employment on that date  without regard to any plan amendments after that date.</p><p class="depth0">Employer X decides not to amend Plan Y to provide for the  adjustments permitted under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) to the accrued  benefit of section 401(a)(17) employees as of December 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under Plan Y, Employee A's accrued benefit at the end of 1989 is  $25,000, which is the greater of Employee A's accrued benefit as of the  last day of the 1988 plan year ($25,000), and $24,000, which is Employee  A's benefit based on the plan's benefit formula applied to Employee A's  total years of service ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by  6 years of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section  401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years  after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in Sec.  1.401(a)-   13(c)(4)(ii) (formula with wear-away). The fresh-start formula is  applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies  section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh- start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date  within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan  Y, as amended, satisfies paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan  years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the  plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, for section  401(a)(17) employees, an employee's benefit will equal the sum of the  employee's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988 (determined as though  the employee terminated employment on that date and without regard to  any amendments after that date), and 2 percent of compensation averaged  over an employee's high 3 consecutive years' compensation times years of  service taking into account only years of service after December 31,  1988. Thus, under Plan Y's formula, Employee A's accrued benefit as of  December 31, 1989 is $29,000, which is equal to the sum of $25,000  (Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988) plus $4,000  ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 1 year of service)).  The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for  calculating their accrued benefits for years after the section  401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in Sec. 1.401(a)-13(c)(4)(i)  (formula without wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a  benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies section 401(a)(17)  and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for  the plan is a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date within the meaning of  paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended,  satisfies paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing  prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(17)</em> fresh-start date  within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan  Y, as amended, satisfies paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan  years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume that for each of the years 1991-93 Employee A's annual  compensation under the plan compensation formula, disregarding the  amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17) is $300,000. The annual  compensation limit is adjusted to $222,220, $228,860, and $235,840 for  plan years beginning January 1, 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively.  Because Employer X has decided to amend Plan Y to comply with the  provisions of this section effective for plan years beginning on or  after January 1, 1989, and has used December 31, 1988 as the section  401(a)(17) fresh-start date, the compensation that may be taken into  account for plan benefits in 1993 cannot exceed $228,973 (the average of  $222,220, $228,860, and $235,840). Therefore, as of December 31, 1993,  the benefit determined under the fresh-start formula with wear-away  would be $45,795 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 10  years of service)). The benefit determined under the fresh-start formula  without wear-away would be $47,897, which is equal to $25,000 (Employee  A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973  multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)). Because  Employee A's accrued benefit is being determined using the fresh-start  formula with extended wear-away, Employee A's accrued benefit as of  December 31, 1993, is equal to $47,897, the greater of the two amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As of December 31, 1993, the numerator of Employee A's  compensation fraction is $228,973 (the average of Employee A's annual  compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993, as limited by the respective  annual limit for each of those years). The denominator of Employee A's  compensation fraction determined in accordance with paragraph  (e)(4)(iii) of this section is $250,000 (the average of Employee A's  high 3 consecutive calendar year compensation as of December 31, 1988,  determined without regard to section 401(a)(17)). Therefore, Employee  A's compensation fraction is $228,973/$250,000. Because the compensation  adjustment fraction is less than 1, Employee A's section 401(a)(17)  frozen accrued benefit is not adjusted. Therefore, Employee A's accrued  benefit as of December 31, 1993, would still be $47,897, which is equal  to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit) plus  $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of  service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)-13(c)(4)(i)</em> (formula  without wear-away) using December 31, 1993 as the OBRA '93 fresh-start  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume that for each of the years 1996-98 Employee A's annual  compensation under the plan compensation definition, disregarding the  amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17), is $400,000.

Separate plans are not  created, however, merely because a partnership agreement provides for  allocation among partners, in proportion to their partnership interests,  of either the cost of funding the plan or surplus assets upon plan  termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate certain situations  in which other arrangements relating to a defined benefit plan are or  are not treated as creating separate plans:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

In  addition, by agreement outside the plan, if the product of the  employee's investment direction exceeds the value needed to fund that  employee's benefits, Employer A agrees to make a special payment to the  participant. In this case, each separate portion of the pool of assets  over which an employee has investment authority is a separate plan for  the employee.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer B is a partnership that maintains a defined  benefit plan. The partnership agreement provides that, upon termination  of the plan, a special allocation of any excess plan assets after  reversion is made to the partnership on the basis of partnership share.

If an employer is treated as operating qualified separate  lines of business for purposes of section 401(a)(26) in accordance with  Sec. 1.414(r)-1(b), the portion of a plan that benefits employees of  one qualified separate line of business is treated as a separate plan  from the portions of the same plan that benefit employees of the other  qualified separate lines of business of the employer. See Sec. Sec.  1.414(r)-1(c)(3) and 1.414(r)-9 (separate application of section  401(a)(26) to the employees of a qualified separate line of business).

An offset or  reduction of benefits under a defined benefit plan satisfies this  paragraph (a)(2) if the benefit formula provides that an employee will  not accrue additional benefits under the current portion of the benefit  formula until the employee has accrued, under such portion, a benefit in  excess of such employee's benefit under one or more formulas in effect  for prior years that are based wholly on prior years of service. The  prior benefit may have accrued under the same or a separate plan, may be  provided under the same or a separate plan and may relate to service  with the same or previous employers. Benefits will not fail to be  treated as based wholly on prior years if they are based, directly or  indirectly, on compensation earned after such prior years (including  compensation earned in the current year), if they are adjusted to  reflect increases in the section 415 limitations, or if they are  increased to provide an ad hoc cost of living adjustment designed to  adjust, in whole or in part, for inflation. Furthermore, benefits do not  fail to be treated as based wholly on prior years merely because the  benefits (e.g., early retirement benefits) are subject to an age or  years-of-service condition and, in applying the condition or conditions,  the current and prior years are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> if the benefit formula  provides a benefit that is offset or reduced by contributions or  benefits under another plan that is maintained by the same employer and  the following additional requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The contributions or benefits under a plan that are used to  offset or reduce the benefits under the positive portion of the fomu1a  being tested accrued under such other plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employees who benefit under the formula being tested also  benefit under the other plan on a reasonable and uniform basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The contributions or benefits under the plan that are used to  offset or reduce the benefits under the formula being tested are not  used to offset or reduce that employee's benefits under any other plan  or any other formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rules for certain section 414(n) employer-recipients.  The same employer requirement in the concurrent benefit offset rule in  paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is waived for certain section  414(n) employer-recipients. Under this exception, an employer-recipient  (within the meaning of sections 414 (n) and (o)) may treat contributions  or benefits under a plan maintained by a leasing organization as  contributions or benefits accrued under the recipient organization plan  provided the following requirements are met: the employer-recipient  maintains a plan covering leased employees (which employees are treated  as employees of the employer-recipient within the meaning of sections  414(n)(2) and 414(o)(2)); the leased employees are also covered under a  plan maintained by the leasing organization; and contributions or  benefits under the plan maintained by the employer-recipient are offset  or reduced by the contributions or benefits under the leasing  organization plan that are attributable to service with the recipient  organization. Also, for purposes of the benefiting condition requirement  in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A)(2) of this section, the employees of the  employer-recipient who are not leased from the leasing organization are  not required to benefit under the plan of the leasing organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>.

Two of the  employees participate in Plan X. The other four employees have not  completed 1 year of service and are therefore not eligible to  participate in Plan X. The four employees who have not completed 1 year  of service are excludable employees and may be disregarded for purposes  of applying the minimum participation test.

In testing Plan 1 to determine whether  it satisfies section 401(a)(26), the 20 employees not meeting the  minimum age and service requirement under Plan 1 are treated as  excludable employees. In testing Plan 2 to determine whether it  satisfies section 401(a)(26), no employees are treated as excludable  employees because Plan 2 does not have a minimum age or service  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain air pilots.

To satisfy section 401(a)(31), added by UCA,  a plan must provide that if the distributee of any eligible rollover  distribution elects to have the distribution paid directly to an  eligible retirement plan, and specifies the eligible retirement plan to  which the distribution is to be paid, then the distribution will be paid  to that eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover described in Q&A-3;  of this section. Thus, the plan must give the distributee the option of  having his or her distribution paid in a direct rollover to an eligible  retirement plan specified by the distributee. For purposes of section  401(a)(31) and this section, eligible rollover distribution has the  meaning set forth in section 402(c)(4) and Sec. 1.402(c)-2, Q&A-3;  through Q&A-10; and Q&A-14;, except as otherwise provided in Q&A-2; of this  section, eligible retirement plan has the meaning set forth in section  402(c)(8)(B) and Sec. 1.402(c)-2, Q&A-2.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Related Internal Revenue Code provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory  withholding. If a distributee of an eligible rollover distribution does  not elect to have the eligible rollover distribution paid directly from  the plan to an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover under  section   401(a)(31), the eligible rollover distribution is subject to 20-percent  income tax withholding under section 3405(c). See Sec. 31.3405(c)-1 of  this chapter for guidance concerning the withholding requirements  applicable to eligible rollover distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice requirement. Section 402(f) requires the plan  administrator of a qualified plan to provide, within a reasonable period  of time before making an eligible rollover distribution, a written  explanation to the distributee of the distributee's right to elect a  direct rollover and the withholding consequences of not making that  election. The explanation also is required to provide certain other  relevant information relating to the taxation of distributions. See  Sec. 1.402(f)-1 for guidance concerning the written explanation  required under section 402(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 403(b) annuities. Section 403(b)(10) provides that  requirements similar to those imposed by section 401(a)(31) apply to  annuities described in section 403(b). See Sec. 1.403(b)-7(b) for  guidance concerning the direct rollover requirements for distributions  from annuities described in section 403(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Statutory effective date.

This section applies to eligible  rollover distributions made on or after October 19, 1995. For eligible  rollover distributions made on or after January 1, 1993 and before  October 19, 1995, Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1T (as it appeared in the April 1,  1995 edition of 26 CFR part 1), applies. However, for any distribution  made on or after January 1, 1993 but before October 19, 1995, a plan may  satisfy section 401(a)(31) by substituting any or all provisions of this  section for the corresponding provisions of Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1T, if  any.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Does section 401(a)(31) require that a qualified plan permit a  direct rollover to be made to a qualified trust that is not part of a  defined contribution plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: No. Section 401(a)(31)(D) limits the types of qualified trusts  that are treated as eligible retirement plans to defined contribution  plans that accept eligible rollover distributions. Therefore, although a  plan is permitted, at a participant's election, to make a direct  rollover to any type of eligible retirement plan, as defined in section  402(c)(8)(B) (including a defined benefit plan), a plan will not fail to  satisfy section 401(a)(31) solely because the plan will not permit a  direct rollover to a qualified trust that is part of a defined benefit  plan. In contrast, if a distributee elects a direct rollover of an  eligible rollover distribution to an annuity plan described in section  403(a), that distribution must be paid to the annuity plan, even if the  recipient annuity plan is a defined benefit plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: What is a direct rollover that satisfies section 401(a)(31),  and how is it accomplished?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: A direct rollover that satisfies section 401(a)(31) is an  eligible rollover distribution that is paid directly to an eligible  retirement plan for the benefit of the distributee. A direct rollover  may be accomplished by any reasonable means of direct payment to an  eligible retirement plan. Reasonable means of direct payment include,  for example, a wire transfer or the mailing of a check to the eligible  retirement plan. If payment is made by check, the check must be  negotiable only by the trustee of the eligible retirement plan. If the  payment is made by wire transfer, the wire transfer must be directed  only to the trustee of the eligible retirement plan. In the case of an  eligible retirement plan that does not have a trustee (such as a  custodial individual retirement account or an individual retirement  annuity), the custodian of the plan or issuer of the contract under the  plan, as appropriate, should be substituted for the trustee for purposes  of this Q&A-3;, and Q&A-4; of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Is providing a distributee with a check for delivery to an  eligible retirement plan a reasonable means of accomplishing a direct  rollover?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Providing the distributee with a check and instructing the  distributee to deliver the check to the eligible retirement plan is a  reasonable means of direct payment, provided that the check is made  payable as follows: [Name of the trustee] as trustee of [name of the  eligible retirement plan]. For example, if the name of the eligible   retirement plan is ``Individual Retirement Account of John Q. Smith,''  and the name of the trustee is ``ABC Bank,'' the payee line of a check  would read ``ABC Bank as trustee of Individual Retirement Account of  John Q. Smith.'' Unless the name of the distributee is included in the  name of the eligible retirement plan, the check also must indicate that  it is for the benefit of the distributee. If the eligible retirement  plan is not an individual retirement account or an individual retirement  annuity, the payee line of the check need not identify the trustee by  name. For example, the payee line of a check for the benefit of  distributee Jane Doe might read, ``Trustee of XYZ Corporation Savings  Plan FBO Jane Doe.''</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: Is an eligible rollover distribution that is paid to an  eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover currently includible in  gross income or subject to 20-percent withholding?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: No. An eligible rollover distribution that is paid to an  eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover is not currently  includible in the distributee's gross income under section 402(c) and is  exempt from the 20-percent withholding imposed under section 3405(c)(2).  However, when any portion of the eligible rollover distribution is  subsequently distributed from the eligible retirement plan, that portion  will be includible in gross income to the extent required under section  402, 403, or 408.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: What procedures may a plan administrator prescribe for electing  a direct rollover, and what information may the plan administrator  require a distributee to provide when electing a direct rollover?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) Permissible procedures. Except as otherwise provided in  paragraph (b) of this Q&A-6;, the plan administrator may prescribe any  procedure for a distributee to elect a direct rollover under section  401(a)(31), provided that the procedure is reasonable. The procedure may  include any reasonable requirement for information or documentation from  the distributee in addition to the items of adequate information  specified in Sec. 31.3405(c)-1(b), Q&A-7; of this chapter. For example,  it would be reasonable for the plan administrator to require that the  distributee provide a statement from the designated recipient plan that  the plan will accept the direct rollover for the benefit of the  distributee and that the recipient plan is, or is intended to be, an  individual retirement account, an individual retirement annuity, a  qualified annuity plan described in section 403(a), or a qualified trust  described in section 401(a), as applicable. In the case of a designated  recipient plan that is a qualified trust, it also would be reasonable  for the plan administrator to require a statement that the qualified  trust is not excepted from the definition of an eligible retirement plan  by section 401(a)(31)(D) (i.e., is not a defined benefit plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Impermissible procedures. A plan will fail to satisfy section  401(a)(31) if the plan administrator prescribes any unreasonable  procedure, or requires information or documentation, that effectively  eliminates or substantially impairs the distributee's ability to elect a  direct rollover. For example, it would effectively eliminate or  substantially impair the distributee's ability to elect a direct  rollover if the recipient plan required the distributee to obtain an  opinion of counsel stating that the eligible retirement plan receiving  the rollover is a qualified plan or individual retirement account.  Similarly, it would effectively eliminate or substantially impair the  distributee's ability to elect a direct rollover if the distributing  plan required a letter from the recipient eligible retirement plan  stating that, upon request by the distributing plan, the recipient plan  will automatically return any direct rollover amount that the  distributing plan advises the recipient plan was paid incorrectly. It  would also effectively eliminate or substantially impair the  distributee's ability to elect a direct rollover if the distributing  plan required, as a condition for making a direct rollover, a letter  from the recipient eligible retirement plan indemnifying the  distributing plan for any liability arising from the distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: May the plan administrator treat a distributee as having made  an election under a default procedure   where the distributee does not affirmatively elect to make or not make a  direct rollover within a certain time period?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: Yes, the plan administrator may establish a default procedure  whereby any distributee who fails to make an affirmative election is  treated as having either made or not made a direct rollover election.  However, the plan administrator may not make a distribution under any  default procedure unless the distributee has received an explanation of  the default procedure and an explanation of the direct rollover option  as required under section 402(f) and Sec. 1.402(f)-1, Q&A-1; and unless  the timing requirements described in Sec. 1.402(f)-1, Q&A-2; and Q&A-3;  have been satisfied with respect to the explanations of both the default  procedure and the direct rollover option.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: May the plan administrator establish a deadline after which the  distributee may not revoke an election to make or not make a direct  rollover?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: Yes, but the plan administrator is not permitted to prescribe  any deadline or time period with respect to revocation of a direct  rollover election that is more restrictive for the distributee than that  which otherwise applies under the plan to revocation of the form of  distribution elected by the distributee.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: Must the plan administrator permit a distributee to elect to  have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible  retirement plan in a direct rollover and to have the remainder of that  distribution paid to the distributee?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: Yes, the plan administrator must permit a distributee to elect  to have a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an  eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover and to have the remainder  paid to the distributee. However, the plan administrator is permitted to  require that, if the distributee elects to have only a portion of an  eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan in a  direct rollover, that portion be equal to at least a specified minimum  amount, provided the specified minimum amount is less than or equal to  $500 or any greater amount as prescribed by the Commissioner in revenue  rulings, notices, and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue  Bulletin. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter. If the entire  amount of the eligible rollover distribution is less than or equal to  the specified minimum amount, the plan administrator need not allow the  distributee to divide the distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: Must the plan administrator allow a distributee to divide an  eligible rollover distribution into two or more separate distributions  to be paid in direct rollovers to two or more eligible retirement plans?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: No. The plan administrator is not required (but is permitted)  to allow the distributee to divide an eligible rollover distribution  into separate distributions to be paid to two or more eligible  retirement plans in direct rollovers. Thus, the plan administrator may  require that the distributee select a single eligible retirement plan to  which the eligible rollover distribution (or portion thereof) will be  distributed in a direct rollover.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: Will a plan satisfy section 401(a)(31) if the plan  administrator does not permit a distributee to elect a direct rollover  if his or her eligible rollover distributions during a year are  reasonably expected to total less than $200?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: Yes. A plan will satisfy section 401(a)(31) even though the  plan administrator does not permit any distributee to elect a direct  rollover with respect to eligible rollover distributions during a year  that are reasonably expected to total less than $200 or any lower  minimum amount specified by the plan administrator. The rules described  in Sec. 31.3405(c)-1, Q&A-14; of this chapter (relating to whether  withholding under section 3405(c) is required for an eligible rollover  distribution that is less than $200) also apply for purposes of  determining whether a direct rollover election under section 401(a)(31)  must be provided for an eligible rollover distribution that is less than  $200 or the lower specified amount.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: Is a plan administrator permitted to treat a distributee's  election to make or not make a direct rollover with respect to one  payment in a series   of periodic payments as applying to all subsequent payments in the  series?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: (a) Yes. A plan administrator is permitted to treat a  distributee's election to make or not make a direct rollover with  respect to one payment in a series of periodic payments as applying to  all subsequent payments in the series, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The employee is permitted at any time to change, with respect to  subsequent payments, a previous election to make or not make a direct  rollover; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The written explanation provided under section 402(f) explains  that the election to make or not make a direct rollover will apply to  all future payments unless the employee subsequently changes the  election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> See Sec. 1.402(f)-1, Q&A-3; for further guidance concerning the  rules for providing section 402(f) notices when eligible rollover  distributions are made in a series of periodic payments.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: Is the eligible retirement plan designated by a distributee to  receive a direct rollover distribution required to accept the  distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: No. Although section 401(a)(31) requires qualified plans to  provide distributees the option to make a direct rollover of their  eligible rollover distributions to an eligible retirement plan, it  imposes no requirement that any eligible retirement plan accept  rollovers. Thus, a plan can refuse to accept rollovers. Alternatively, a  plan can limit the circumstances under which it will accept rollovers.  For example, a plan can limit the types of plans from which it will  accept a rollover or limit the types of assets it will accept in a  rollover (such as accepting only cash or its equivalent).</p><p class="depth0">Q-14. If a plan accepts an invalid rollover contribution, whether or  not as a direct rollover, how will the contribution be treated for  purposes of applying the qualification requirements of section 401(a) or  403(a) to the plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-14. (a) Acceptance of invalid rollover contribution. If a plan  accepts an invalid rollover contribution, the contribution will be  treated, for purposes of applying the qualification requirements of  section 401(a) or 403(a) to the receiving plan, as if it were a valid  rollover contribution, if the following two conditions are satisfied.  First, when accepting the amount from the employee as a rollover  contribution, the plan administrator of the receiving plan reasonably  concludes that the contribution is a valid rollover contribution. While  evidence that the distributing plan is the subject of a determination  letter from the Commissioner indicating that the distributing plan is  qualified would be useful to the receiving plan administrator in  reasonably concluding that the contribution is a valid rollover  contribution, it is not necessary for the distributing plan to have such  a determination letter in order for the receiving plan administrator to  reach that conclusion. Second, if the plan administrator of the  receiving plan later determines that the contribution was an invalid  rollover contribution, the amount of the invalid rollover contribution,  plus any earnings attributable thereto, is distributed to the employee  within a reasonable time after such determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this Q&A-14;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An invalid rollover contribution is an amount that is accepted  by a plan as a rollover within the meaning of Sec. 1.402(c)-2, Q&A-1;  (or as a rollover contribution within the meaning of section  408(d)(3)(A)(ii)) but that is not an eligible rollover distribution from  a qualified plan (or an amount described in section 408(d)(3)(A)(ii)) or  that does not satisfy the other requirements of section 401(a)(31),  402(c), or 408(d)(3) for treatment as a rollover or a rollover  contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A valid rollover contribution is a contribution that is accepted  by a plan as a rollover within the meaning of Sec. 1.402(c)-2, Q&A-1; or  as a rollover contribution within the meaning of section 408(d)(3) and  that satisfies the requirements of section 401(a)(31), 402(c), or  408(d)(3) for treatment as a rollover or a rollover contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this Q&A-14; are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer X maintains for its employees Plan M, a  profit sharing plan qualified under section 401(a). Plan M provides that  any employee of Employer X may make a rollover contribution to Plan M.  Employee A is an employee of Employer X, will   not have attained age 70\1/2\ by the end of the year, and has a vested  account balance in Plan O (a plan maintained by Employee A's prior  employer). Employee A elects a single sum distribution from Plan O and  elects that it be paid to Plan M in a direct rollover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employee A provides the plan administrator of Plan M with a  letter from the plan administrator of Plan O stating that Plan O has  received a determination letter from the Commissioner indicating that  Plan O is qualified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based upon such a letter, absent facts to the contrary, a plan  administrator may reasonably conclude that Plan O is qualified and that  the amount paid as a direct rollover is an eligible rollover  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 1, except that,  instead of the letter provided in paragraph (ii) of Example 1, Employee  A provides the plan administrator of Plan M with a letter from the plan  administrator of Plan O representing that Plan O satisfies the  requirements of section 401(a) (or representing that Plan O is intended  to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) and that the administrator  of Plan O is not aware of any Plan O provision or operation that would  result in the disqualification of Plan O).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based upon such a letter, absent facts to the contrary, a plan  administrator may reasonably conclude that Plan O is qualified and that  the amount paid as a direct rollover is an eligible rollover  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Same facts as Example 1, except that Employee A  elects to receive the distribution from Plan O and wishes to make a  rollover contribution described in section 402 rather than a direct  rollover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When making the rollover contribution, Employee A certifies  that, to the best of Employee A's knowledge, Employee A is entitled to  the distribution as an employee and not as a beneficiary, the  distribution from Plan O to be contributed to Plan M is not one of a  series of periodic payments, the distribution from Plan O was received  by Employee A not more than 60 days before the date of the rollover  contribution, and the entire amount of the rollover contribution would  be includible in gross income if it were not being rolled over.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As support for these certifications, Employee A provides the  plan administrator of Plan M with two statements from Plan O. The first  is a letter from the plan administrator of Plan O, as described in  Example 1, stating that Plan O has received a determination letter from  the Commissioner indicating that Plan O is qualified. The second is the  distribution statement that accompanied the distribution check. The  distribution statement indicates that the distribution is being made by  Plan O to Employee A, indicates the gross amount of the distribution,  and indicates the amount withheld as Federal income tax. The amount  withheld as Federal income tax is 20 percent of the gross amount of the  distribution. Employee A contributes to Plan M an amount not greater  than the gross amount of the distribution stated in the letter from Plan  O and the contribution is made within 60 days of the date of the  distribution statement from Plan O.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Based on the certifications and documentation provided by  Employee A, absent facts to the contrary, a plan administrator may  reasonably conclude that Plan O is qualified and that the distribution  otherwise satisfies the requirements of section 402(c) for treatment as  a rollover contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that,  rather than contributing the distribution from Plan O to Plan M,  Employee A contributes the distribution from Plan O to IRA P, an  individual retirement account described in section 408(a). After the  contribution of the distribution from Plan O to IRA P, but before the  year in which Employee A attains age 70\1/2\, Employee A requests a  distribution from IRA P and decides to contribute it to Plan M as a  rollover contribution. To make the rollover contribution, Employee A  endorses the check received from IRA P as payable to Plan M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to providing the certifications described in  Example 3 with respect to the distribution from Plan O, Employee A  certifies that, to the best of Employee A's knowledge, the contribution  to IRA P was not made more than 60 days after the date Employee A  received the distribution from Plan O, no amount other than the  distribution from Plan O has been contributed to IRA P, and the  distribution from IRA P was received not more than 60 days earlier than  the rollover contribution to Plan M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As support for these certifications, in addition to the two  statements from Plan O described in Example 3, Employee A provides  copies of statements from IRA P. The statements indicate that the  account is identified as an IRA, the account was established within 60  days of the date of the letter from Plan O informing Employee A that an  amount had been distributed, and the opening balance in the IRA does not  exceed the amount of the distribution described in the letter from Plan  O. There is no indication in the statements that any additional  contributions have been made to IRA P since the account was opened. The  date on the check from IRA P is less than 60 days before the date that  Employee A makes the contribution to Plan M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Based on the certifications and documentation provided by  Employee A, absent facts to the contrary, a plan administrator may  reasonably conclude that Plan O is qualified and that the contribution  by Employee A is a rollover contribution described in section  408(d)(3)(A)(ii) that satisfies the   other requirements of section 408(d)(3) for treatment as a rollover  contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: For purposes of applying the plan qualification requirements  of section 401(a), is an eligible rollover distribution that is paid to  an eligible retirement plan in a direct rollover a distribution and  rollover or is it a transfer of assets and liabilities?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: For purposes of applying the plan qualification requirements  of section 401(a), a direct rollover is a distribution and rollover of  the eligible rollover distribution and not a transfer of assets and  liabilities. For example, if the consent requirements under section  411(a)(11) or sections 401(a)(11) and 417(a)(2) apply to the  distribution, they must be satisfied before the eligible rollover  distribution may be distributed in a direct rollover. Similarly, the  direct rollover is not a transfer of assets and liabilities that must  satisfy the requirements of section 414(l). Finally, a direct rollover  is not a transfer of benefits for purposes of applying the requirements  under section 411(d)(6), as described in Sec. 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3.;  Therefore, for example, the eligible retirement plan is not required to  provide, with respect to amounts paid to it in a direct rollover, the  same optional forms of benefits that were provided under the plan that  made the direct rollover. The direct rollover requirements of section  401(a)(31) do not affect the ability of a qualified plan to make an  elective or nonelective transfer of assets and liabilities to another  qualified plan in accordance with applicable law (such as section  414(l)).</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: Must a direct rollover option be provided for an eligible  rollover distribution that is in the form of a plan loan offset amount?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: A plan will not fail to satisfy section 401(a)(31) merely  because the plan does not permit a distributee to elect a direct  rollover of an eligible rollover distribution in the form of a plan loan  offset amount. Section 1.402(c)-2(b), Q&A-9; defines a plan loan offset  amount, in general, as a distribution that occurs when, under the terms  governing a plan loan, the participant's accrued benefit is reduced  (offset) in order to repay the loan. A plan administrator is permitted  to allow a direct rollover of a participant note for a plan loan to a  qualified trust described in section 401(a) or a qualified annuity plan  described in section 403(a).

An applicable defined contribution plan must  offer not less than three investment options, other than employer  securities, to which an individual who has the right to divest under  paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section may direct the proceeds from  the divestment of employer securities. Each of the three investment  options must be diversified and have materially different risk and  return characteristics. For this purpose, investment options that  constitute a broad range of investment alternatives within the meaning  of Department of Labor Regulation section 2550.404c-1(b)(3) are treated  as being diversified and having materially different risk and return  characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Restrictions or conditions on investments in employer  securities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Impermissible restrictions or conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General  rule. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an  applicable defined contribution plan violates the requirements of this  paragraph (e) if the plan imposes restrictions or conditions with  respect to the investment of employer securities that are not imposed on  the investment of other assets of the plan. A restriction or condition  with respect to employer securities means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A restriction on an individual's right to divest an investment  in employer securities that is not imposed on an investment that is not  employer securities; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A benefit that is conditioned on investment in employer  securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Indirect restrictions or conditions--(A) Except as provided in  paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a plan violates the requirements of  this paragraph (e) if the plan imposes a restriction or condition  described in paragraph (e)(1)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> or (B) of this section either  directly or indirectly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A plan imposes an indirect restriction on an individual's right  to divest an investment in employer securities if, for example, the plan  provides that a participant who divests his or her account balance with  respect to the investment in employer securities is not permitted for a  period of time thereafter to reinvest in employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A plan does not impose an indirect restriction or condition  merely because there are tax consequences that result from an  individual's divestment of an investment in employer securities. Thus,  the loss of the special treatment for net unrealized appreciation  provided under section 402(e)(4) with respect to employer securities is  disregarded. Similarly, a plan does not impose an impermissible  restriction or condition merely because it provides that an individual  may not reinvest divested amounts in the same employer securities  account but is permitted to invest such divested amounts in another  employer securities account where the only relevant difference between  the separate accounts is the section 402(e)(4) cost (or other basis) of  the   trust in the shares held in each account.

A plan is permitted to impose a restriction or  condition on the divestiture of employer securities that is either  required in order to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws  or is reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable  securities laws. For example, it is permissible for a plan to limit  divestiture rights for participants who are subject to section 16(b) of  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f) to a reasonable  period (such as 3 to 12 days) following publication of the employer's  quarterly earnings statements because it is reasonably designed to  ensure compliance with Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange  Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Deferred application of the diversification requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Becoming an applicable defined contribution plan. An applicable defined  contribution plan is permitted to restrict the application of the  diversification requirements of section 401(a)(35) and this section for  up to 90 days after the plan becomes an applicable defined contribution  plan (for example, a plan becoming an applicable defined contribution  plan because the employer securities held under the plan become publicly  traded).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of this section  that the investment must be independent of the employer (including the  situation where the fund no longer meets the percentage limitation rule  in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section), the plan does not fail to  satisfy the diversification requirements of section 401(a)(35) and this  section merely because it does not offer those rights with respect to  that investment fund for up to 90 days after the investment fund ceases  to meet those requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Permitted indirect restrictions or conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  An applicable defined contribution plan does not violate the  requirements of this paragraph (e) merely because it imposes an indirect  restriction or condition set forth in this paragraph (e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation on investment in employer securities. A plan is  permitted to limit the extent to which an individual's account balance  can be invested in employer securities, provided the limitation applies  without regard to a prior exercise of rights to divest employer  securities. For example, a plan does not impose a restriction that  violates this paragraph (e) merely because the plan prohibits a  participant from investing additional amounts in employer securities if  more than 10 percent of that participant's account balance is invested  in employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trading frequency. A plan is permitted to impose reasonable  restrictions on the timing and number of investment elections that an  individual can make to invest in employer securities, provided that the  restrictions are designed to limit short-term trading in the employer  securities. For example, a plan could provide that a participant may not  elect to invest in employer securities if the employee has elected to  divest employer securities within a short period of time, such as seven  days, prior to the election to invest in employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fees. The plan has not provided an indirect benefit that is  conditioned on investment in employer securities merely because the plan  imposes fees on other investment options that are not imposed on the  investment in employer securities.

A plan is permitted to  prohibit any further investment in employer securities. Thus, a plan is  not treated as imposing an indirect restriction merely because it  provides that an employee that divests an investment in employer  securities is not permitted to reinvest in employer securities, but only  if the plan does not permit additional contributions or other  investments to be invested in employer securities. For this purpose, a  plan does not provide for further investment in employer securities  merely because dividends paid on employer securities under the plan are  reinvested in employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> only applies to employer securities that were  acquired in a plan year beginning before January 1, 2007, with the  proceeds of an exempt loan within the meaning of section 4975(d)(3)  which is not refinanced after the end of the last plan year beginning  before January 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Delegation of authority to Commissioner.

For example, a nontransferable face-amount  certificate described in   section 401(g) and the regulations thereunder is considered an annuity  on the life of the owner-employee if the proceeds of such contract are  payable only to the owner-employee or his beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For any taxable year of the employer, the amount of  contributions by the employer on behalf of the owner-employee which is  applied to pay premiums under the contracts described in this paragraph  must not exceed the average of the amounts deductible under section 404  by such employer on behalf of such owner-employee for the most recent  three taxable years of the employer which are described in the  succeeding sentence. The three employer taxable years described in the  preceding sentence must be years, ending prior to the date the latest  contract was entered into or modified to provide additional, benefits,  in which the owner-employee derived earned income from the trade or  business with respect to which the plan is established.

Thus, for  example, if, in 1975, a nonwillful excess contribution described in  section 401(e)(1) (prior to such amendment) is made on behalf of an  owner-employee, the plan will not be qualified unless the provisions  required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such 401(d)(8) are contained in  the plan and made applicable to excess contributions made for such  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976. In such case, the effect  of such contribution on the plan, the employer, and the owner-employee  would be determined under paragraph (2) of section 401(e), as in effect  on September 1, 1974. By reason of section 401(e)(2)(F), as in effect   on September 1, 1974, the period for assessing any deficiency by reason  of the excess contribution will not expire until the expiration of the  6-month period described in section 401(e)(2)(C), as in effect on  September 1, 1974, even if the first day of such 6-month period falls in  a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975. For the rules  applicable to a willful excess contribution, which generally divide an  owner-employee's interest in a plan into two parts on the basis of  employer taxable years beginning before and after December 31, 1975, see  Sec. 1.72-17A(e)(2)(v). In the case of a willful excess contribution,  the rule specified in section 401(e)(2)(E)(iii), as in effect on  September 1, 1974, shall not apply to any taxable year of an employer  beginning on or after January 1, 1976. Thus, for example, if a willful  excess contribution was made to a plan on behalf of an owner-employee  with respect to his employer's taxable year beginning January 1, 1975,  the plan would not meet, for purposes of section 404, the requirements  of section 401(d) with respect to that owner-employee for such year, but  the 5 taxable years following such year would be unaffected because  those years begin on or after January 1, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> For purposes of applying the excess contribution rules with  respect to the employer taxable years specified in subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph for such an employer taxable year which begins after  December 31, 1973, see section 404(e) and Sec. 1.404(e)-1A for rules  increasing the limitation on the amount of allowable employer deductions  on behalf of owner-employees under section 404.

A, a self-employed individual, has established the P  Profit-Sharing Plan, which covers A and his two commonlaw employees, B  and C. A's taxable year and the plan's plan year are both the calendar  year. For 1976, A has earned income of $150,000, and B and C each  receive compensation of less than $100,000 from A. If he wishes to  contribute $7,500 to the plan on his behalf for 1976, A must also  contribute to the accounts of B and C under the plan amounts at least  equal to 7\1/2\ percent of their respective compensation for 1976.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. D, an owner-employee within the meaning of section  401(c)(3), is a participant in the Q Qualified Defined Contribution  Plan, which, in 1975, satisfies the requirements of section 401(d)(6)  and all other integration requirements applicable to qualified defined  contribution plans. The taxable years of D, the employer of D within the  meaning of section 401(c)(4), and the plan are all calendar years. The  plan provides for an integration level of $13,200 and a contribution  rate of 5 percent of compensation in excess of $13,200. For 1975, D has  earned income of $115,000. The maximum amount of earned income upon  which D's contribution can be determined is $86,800, and the  contribution based upon this maximum amount of earned income is $4,340,  computed as follows:  Maximum annual compensation which may be taken into account..   $100,000 Less: Social Security Act integration level..................     13,200</p><p class="depth0">---------- Plan contribution base.......................................    $86,800 Multiplied by: Contribution rate (percent)...................          5</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total....................................................     $4,340</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>,  as in effect on September 1, 1974, this section applies to such taxable  years of an employer.</p><p class="depth0">Thus, for example, a plan of a calendar year employer which was  adopted on January 1, 1974, would be subject to this section in 1974, if  the employer made a contribution on behalf of any employee within the  meaning of section 401(c)(1) for such year in excess of the $2,500 or 10  percent earned income limit, whichever is applicable to that employee,  specified in section 404(e)(1) as in effect prior to the amendment to  such Code section made by section 2001(a)(1)(A) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 952). The plan  described in the proceeding sentence would also be subject to this  section in 1974, if the employer made a contribution on behalf of   any employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) which is allowable  as a deduction only because of the addition of paragraph (4) to Code  section 404(e) made by section 2001(a)(3) of such Act (88 Stat. 952).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [T.D. 7636, 44 FR 47055, Aug. 10, 1979; T.D. 7636, 60 FR 21435, May 2,  1995]    Sec. 1.401(e)-6  Special rules for shareholder-employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(17)</em>, a plan which provides contributions or  benefits for employees, some or all of whom are shareholder-employees  within the meaning of section 1379(d), is subject to the same limitation  on annual compensation as a plan which provides such contributions or  benefits for employees some or all of whom are self-employed individuals  within the meaning of section 401(c)(1). Thus, a plan which provides  contributions or benefits for such shareholder-employees is subject to  the rules provided by Sec. 1.401(e)-5, unless otherwise specified. See  also section 1379.

Thus, for example if an electing small business corporation whose  taxable year is the calendar year adopted a plan on January 1, 1974, the  plan would be subject to the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this  section in 1974, if the corporation made a contribution in excess of  $2,500 on behalf of any shareholder-employee for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [T.D. 7636, 44 FR 47056, Aug. 10, 1979]    Sec. 1.401(f)-1  Certain custodial accounts and annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of a custodial account or an annuity contract as a  qualified trust. Beginning on January 1, 1974, a custodial account or an  annuity contract may be used, in lieu of a trust, under any qualified  pension, profitsharing, or stock bonus plan if the requirements of  paragraph (b) of this section are met. A custodial account or an annuity  contract may be used under such a plan, whether the plan covers common- law employees, self-employed individuals who are treated as employees by  reason of section 401(c), or both. The use of a custodial account or  annuity contract as part of a plan does not preclude the use of a trust  or another custodial account or another annuity contract as part of the  same plan. A plan under which a custodial account or an annuity contract  is used may be considered in connection with other plans of the employer  in determining whether the requirements of section 401 are satisfied.  For regulations relating to the period before January 1, 1974, see Sec.  1.401-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules applicable to custodial accounts and annuity contracts.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Beginning on January 1, 1974, a custodial account or an annuity  contract is treated as a qualified trust under section 401 if the  following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The custodial account or annuity contract would, except for that  fact that it is not a trust, constitute a qualified trust under section  401; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a custodial account, the custodian either is a  bank or is another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the  Commissioner, that the manner in which he will hold the assets will be  consistent with the requirements of section 401. This demonstration must  be made in the same manner as the demonstration required by Sec. 1.408- 2(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not  a trust, constitute a qualified trust under section 401, it must, for  example, be created pursuant to a written agreement which constitutes a  valid contract under local law. In addition, the terms   of the contract must make it impossible, prior to the satisfaction of  all liabilities with respect to the employees and their beneficiaries  covered by the plan. For any part of the funds of the custodial account  to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive  benefit of the employees or their beneficiaries as provided for in the  plan (see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.401-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An annuity contract would, except for the fact that it is not a  trust, constitute a qualified trust under section 401 if it is purchased  by an employer for an employee under a plan which meets the requirements  of section 404(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder, except that the  plan may be either a pension or a profit-sharing plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect of this section. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any custodial account or annuity  contract which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this  section is treated as a qualified trust for all purposes of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954. Such a custodial account or annuity contract is  treated as a separate legal person which is exempt from the income tax  under section 501(a). In addition, the person holding the assets of such  account or holding such contract is treated as the trustee thereof.  Accordingly, such person is required to file the returns described in  sections 6033 and 6047 and to supply any other information which the  trustee of a qualified trust is required to furnish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any procedure which has the effect of merely substituting one  custodian for another shall not be considered as terminating or  interrupting the legal existence of a custodial account which otherwise  satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The beneficiary of a custodial account which satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is taxed in accordance  with section 402. In determining whether the funds of a custodial  account are distributed or made available to an employee or his  beneficiary, the rules which under section 402(a) are applicable to  trusts will also apply to the custodial account as though it were a  separate legal person and not an agent of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a custodial account which has qualified under section 401  fails to qualify under such section for any taxable year, such custodial  account will not thereafter be treated as a separate legal person, and  the funds in such account shall be treated as made available within the  meaning of section 402(a)(1) to the employees for whom they are held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The beneficiary of an annuity contract which satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is taxed as if he were the  beneficiary of an annuity contract described in section 403(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions.

For purposes of the preceding sentence,  the contract does not include a life, health or accident, property,  casualty or liability insurance contract. For purposes of this  paragraph, a contract which is issued by an insurance company will not  be considered a life insurance contract merely because the contract  provides incidental life insurance protection.

[T.D. 9169, 69 FR 78154, Dec. 29, 2004, as amended by T.D. 9237, 71 FR 9  Jan. 3, 2006; T.D. 9324, 72 FR 21109, Apr. 30, 2007; T.D. 9447, 74 FR  8207, Feb. 24, 2009; T.D. 9641, 78 FR 68737, Nov. 15, 2013]    Sec. 1.401(k)-1  Certain cash or deferred arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain plans permitted to include cash or  deferred arrangements. A plan, other than a profit-sharing, stock bonus,  pre-ERISA money purchase pension, or rural cooperative plan, does not  satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) if the plan includes a cash  or deferred arrangement. A profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money  purchase pension, or rural cooperative plan does not fail to satisfy the  requirements of section 401(a) merely because the plan includes a cash  or deferred arrangement. A cash or deferred arrangement is part of a  plan for purposes of this section if any contributions to the plan, or  accruals or other benefits under the plan, are made or provided pursuant  to the cash or deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules applicable to cash or deferred arrangements generally--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Definition of cash or deferred arrangement. Except as provided in  paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a cash or deferred  arrangement is an arrangement under which an eligible employee may make  a cash or deferred election with respect   to contributions to, or accruals or other benefits under, a plan that is  intended to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) (including a  contract that is intended to satisfy the requirements of section  403(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> even if the employee's election to make after- tax employee contributions is made before the amounts subject to the  election are currently available to the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment of elective contributions as plan assets. The extent  to which elective contributions constitute plan assets for purposes of  the prohibited transaction provisions of section 4975 and title I of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 829), Public  Law 93-406, is determined in accordance with regulations and rulings  issued by the Department of Labor. See 29 CFR 2510.3-102.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rules applicable to cash or deferred elections generally--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Definition of cash or deferred election. A cash or deferred election is  any direct or indirect election (or modification of an earlier election)  by an employee to have the employer either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Provide an amount to the employee in the form of cash (or some  other taxable benefit) that is not currently available; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contribute an amount to a trust, or provide an accrual or other  benefit, under a plan deferring the receipt of compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatic enrollment. For purposes of determining whether an  election is a cash or deferred election, it is irrelevant whether the  default that applies in the absence of an affirmative election is  described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section (i.e., the employee  receives an amount in cash or some other taxable benefit) or in  paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section (i.e., the employer contributes  an amount to a trust or provides an accrual or other benefit under a  plan deferring the receipt of compensation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rules related to timing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Requirement that amounts not be  currently available. A cash or deferred election can only be made with  respect to an amount that is not currently available to the employee on  the date of the election. Further, a cash or deferred election can only  be made with respect to amounts that would (but for the cash or deferred  election) become currently available after the later of the date on  which the employer adopts the cash or deferred arrangement or the date  on which the arrangement first becomes effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contribution may not precede election. A contribution is made  pursuant to a cash or deferred election only if the contribution is made  after the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contribution may not precede services--(1) General rule.  Contributions are made pursuant to a cash or deferred election only if  the contributions are made after the employee's performance of service  with respect to which the contributions are made (or when the cash or  other taxable benefit would be currently available, if earlier).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for bona fide administrative considerations. The  timing of contributions will not be treated as failing to satisfy the  requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) merely because  contributions for a pay period are occasionally made before the services  with respect to that pay period are performed, provided the  contributions are made early in order to accommodate   bona fide administrative considerations (for example, the temporary  absence of the bookkeeper with responsibility to transmit contributions  to the plan) and are not paid early with a principal purpose of  accelerating deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Current availability defined. Cash or another taxable benefit  is currently available to the employee if it has been paid to the  employee or if the employee is able currently to receive the cash or  other taxable benefit at the employee's discretion. An amount is not  currently available to an employee if there is a significant limitation  or restriction on the employee's right to receive the amount currently.  Similarly, an amount is not currently available as of a date if the  employee may under no circumstances receive the amount before a  particular time in the future. The determination of whether an amount is  currently available to an employee does not depend on whether it has  been constructively received by the employee for purposes of section  451.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certain one-time elections not treated as cash or deferred  elections. A cash or deferred election does not include a one-time  irrevocable election made no later than the employee's first becoming  eligible under the plan or any other plan or arrangement of the employer  that is described in section 219(g)(5)(A) (whether or not such other  plan or arrangement has terminated), to have contributions equal to a  specified amount or percentage of the employee's compensation (including  no amount of compensation) made by the employer on the employee's behalf  to the plan and a specified amount or percentage of the employee's  compensation (including no amount of compensation) divided among all  other plans or arrangements of the employer (including plans or  arrangements not yet established) for the duration of the employee's  employment with the employer, or in the case of a defined benefit plan  to receive accruals or other benefits (including no benefits) under such  plans. Thus, for example, employer contributions made pursuant to a one- time irrevocable election described in this paragraph are not treated as  having been made pursuant to a cash or deferred election and are not  includible in an employee's gross income by reason of Sec. 1.402(a)- 1(d). In the case of an irrevocable election made on or before December  23, 1994--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The election does not fail to be treated as a one-time  irrevocable election under this paragraph (a)(3)(v) merely because an  employee was previously eligible under another plan of the employer  (whether or not such other plan has terminated); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a plan in which partners may participate, the  election does not fail to be treated as a one-time irrevocable election  under this paragraph (a)(3)(v) merely because the election was made  after commencement of employment or after the employee's first becoming  eligible under any plan of the employer, provided that the election was  made before the first day of the first plan year beginning after  December 31, 1988, or, if later, March 31, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tax treatment of employees. An amount generally is includible  in an employee's gross income for the taxable year in which the employee  actually or constructively receives the amount. But for section  402(e)(3), an employee is treated as having received an amount that is  contributed to an exempt trust or plan described in section 401(a) or  403(a) pursuant to the employee's cash or deferred election. This is the  case even if the election to defer is made before the year in which the  amount is earned, or before the amount is currently available. See Sec.  1.402(a)-1(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (a)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer maintains a profit-sharing plan under  which each eligible employee has an election to defer an annual bonus  payable on January 30 each year. The bonus equals 10% of compensation  during the previous calendar year. Deferred amounts are not treated as  after-tax employee contributions. The bonus is currently available on  January 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An election made prior to January 30 to defer all or part of  the bonus is a cash or deferred election, and the bonus deferral  arrangement is a cash or deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer maintains a profit-sharing plan which  provides for discretionary profit sharing contributions and   under which each eligible employee may elect to reduce his compensation  by up to 10% and to have the employer contribute such amount to the  plan. The employer pays each employee every two weeks for services  during the immediately preceding two weeks. The employee's election to  defer compensation for a payroll period must be made prior to the date  the amount would otherwise be paid. The employer contributes to the plan  the amount of compensation that each employee elected to defer, at the  time it would otherwise be paid to the employee, and does not treat the  contribution as an after-tax employee contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The election is a cash or deferred election and the  contributions are elective contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that  the employer makes a $10,000 contribution on January 31 of the plan year  that is in addition to the contributions that satisfy the employer's  obligation to make contributions with respect to cash or deferred  elections for prior payroll periods. Employee A makes an election on  February 15 to defer $2,000 from compensation that is not currently  available and the employer reduces the employee's compensation to  reflect the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> None of the additional $10,000 contributed January 31 is a  contribution made pursuant to Employee A's cash or deferred election,  because the contribution was made before the election was made.  Accordingly, the employer must make an additional contribution of $2,000  in order to satisfy its obligation to contribute an amount to the plan  pursuant to Employee A's election. The $10,000 contribution may be  allocated under the plan terms providing for discretionary profit  sharing contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that  Employee A had an outstanding election to defer $500 from each payroll  period's compensation. The $10,000 additional payment that is  contributed early is not made early in order to accommodate bona fide  administrative considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> None of the additional $10,000 contributed January 31 is a  contribution made pursuant to Employee A's cash or deferred election for  future payroll periods, because the contribution was made before the  earlier of Employee A's performance of services to which the  contribution is attributable or when the compensation would be currently  available. Furthermore, the exception for early contributions in  paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C)(2) of this section does not apply. Accordingly,  the employer must make an additional contribution of $500 per payroll  period in order to satisfy its obligation to contribute an amount to the  plan pursuant to Employee A's election. The $10,000 contribution may be  allocated under the plan terms providing for discretionary profit  sharing contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer B establishes a money purchase pension plan  in 1986. This is the first qualified plan established by Employer B. All  salaried employees are eligible to participate under the plan. Hourly- paid employees are not eligible to participate under the plan. In 2000,  Employer B establishes a profit-sharing plan under which all employees  (both salaried and hourly) are eligible. Employer B permits all  employees on the effective date of the profit-sharing plan to make a  one-time irrevocable election to have Employer B contribute 5% of  compensation on their behalf to the plan and make no other contribution  to any other plan of Employer B (including plans not yet established)  for the duration of the employee's employment with Employer B, and have  their salaries reduced by 5%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The election provided under the profit-sharing plan is not a  one-time irrevocable election within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3)(v)  of this section with respect to the salaried employees of Employer B  who, before becoming eligible to participate under the profit-sharing  plan, became eligible to participate under the money purchase pension  plan. The election under the profit-sharing plan is a one-time  irrevocable election within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this  section with respect to the hourly employees, because they were not  previously eligible to participate under another plan of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules applicable to qualified cash or deferred arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Definition of qualified cash or deferred arrangement. A qualified cash  or deferred arrangement is a cash or deferred arrangement that satisfies  the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of elective contributions as employer contributions.  Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(3), elective  contributions under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement (including  designated Roth contributions) are treated as employer contributions.  Thus, for example, elective contributions under such an arrangement are  treated as employer contributions for purposes of sections 401(a),  401(k), 402, 404, 409, 411, 412, 415, 416, and 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tax treatment of employees. Except as provided in section  402(g), 402A (effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,  2005), or Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(3), elective contributions under a  qualified cash or deferred arrangement are neither includible in an  employee's   gross income at the time the cash would have been includible in the  employee's gross income (but for the cash or deferred election), nor at  the time the elective contributions are contributed to the plan. See  Sec. 1.402(a)-1(d)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Application of nondiscrimination requirements to plan that  includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exclusive means  of amounts testing. Elective contributions (including elective  contributions that are designated Roth contributions) under a qualified  cash or deferred arrangement satisfy the requirements of section  401(a)(4) with respect to amounts if and only if the amount of elective  contributions satisfies the nondiscrimination test of section 401(k)  under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 1(b)(2)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Testing benefits, rights and features. A plan that includes a  qualified cash or deferred arrangement must satisfy the requirements of  section 401(a)(4) with respect to benefits, rights and features in  addition to the requirements regarding amounts described in paragraph  (a)(4)(iv)(A) of this section. For example, the right to make each level  of elective contributions under a cash or deferred arrangement and the  right to make designated Roth contributions are rights or features  subject to the requirements of section 401(a)(4). See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 4(e)(3)(i) and (iii)(D). Thus, for example, if all employees are  eligible to make a stated level of elective contributions under a cash  or deferred arrangement, but that level of contributions can only be  made from compensation in excess of a stated amount, such as the Social  Security taxable wage base, the arrangement will generally favor HCEs  with respect to the availability of elective contributions and thus will  generally not satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Minimum coverage requirement. A qualified cash or deferred  arrangement is treated as a separate plan that must satisfy the  requirements of section 410(b). See Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(1) for special  rules. The determination of whether a cash or deferred arrangement  satisfies the requirements of section 410(b) must be made without regard  to the modifications to the disaggregation rules set forth in paragraph  (b)(4)(v) of this section. See also Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(g)(3)(vii)(A),  relating to corrective amendments that may be made to satisfy the  minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules applicable to nonqualified cash or deferred arrangements-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition of nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement. A  nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement is a cash or deferred  arrangement that fails to satisfy one or more of the requirements in  paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of elective contributions as nonelective  contributions. Except as specifically provided otherwise, elective  contributions under a nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement are  treated as nonelective employer contributions. Thus, for example, the  elective contributions under such an arrangement are treated as  nonelective employer contributions for purposes of sections 401(a)  (including section 401(a)(4)) and 401(k), 404, 409, 411, 412, 415, 416,  and 417 and are not subject to the requirements of section 401(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tax treatment of employees. Elective contributions under a  nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement are includible in an  employee's gross income at the time the cash or other taxable amount  that the employee would have received (but for the cash or deferred  election) would have been includible in the employee's gross income. See  Sec. 1.402(a)-1(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Qualification of plan that includes a nonqualified cash or  deferred arrangement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A profit-sharing, stock bonus,  pre-ERISA money purchase pension, or rural cooperative plan does not  fail to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) merely because the  plan includes a nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement. In  determining whether the plan satisfies the requirements of section  401(a)(4), the nondiscrimination tests of sections 401(k), paragraph  (b)(1) of this section, section 401(m)(2) and Sec. 1.401(m)-1(b) may  not be used. See Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 1.410(b)-9  (definition of section 401(k) plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Application of section 401(a)(4) to certain plans. The amount of  employer contributions under a nonqualified   cash or deferred arrangement is treated as satisfying section 401(a)(4)  if the arrangement is part of a collectively bargained plan that  automatically satisfies the requirements of section 410(b). See  Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-(c)(5) and 1.410(b)-2(b)(7). Additionally, the  requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) do not apply to a  governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)) maintained by a  State or local government or political subdivision thereof (or agency or  instrumentality thereof). See sections 401(a)(5) and 410(c)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (a)(5):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the 2006 plan year, Employer A maintains a  collectively bargained plan that includes a cash or deferred  arrangement. Employer contributions under the cash or deferred  arrangement do not satisfy the nondiscrimination test of section 401(k)  and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. Under paragraph (a)(5)(iii)  of this section and under Sec. 1.402(a)-1(d)(1), however, the elective  contributions are includible in each employee's gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Rules applicable to cash or deferred arrangements of self- employed individuals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application of general rules. Generally, a  partnership or sole proprietorship is permitted to maintain a cash or  deferred arrangement, and individual partners or owners are permitted to  make cash or deferred elections with respect to compensation  attributable to services rendered to the entity, under the same rules  that apply to other cash or deferred arrangements. For example, any  contributions made on behalf of an individual partner or owner pursuant  to a cash or deferred arrangement of a partnership or sole  proprietorship are elective contributions unless they are designated or  treated as after-tax employee contributions. In the case of a  partnership, a cash or deferred arrangement includes any arrangement  that directly or indirectly permits individual partners to vary the  amount of contributions made on their behalf. Consistent with Sec.  1.402(a)-1(d), the elective contributions under such an arrangement are  includible in income and are not deductible under section 404(a) unless  the arrangement is a qualified cash or deferred arrangement (i.e., the  requirements of section 401(k) and this section are satisfied). Also,  even if the arrangement is a qualified cash or deferred arrangement, the  elective contributions are includible in gross income and are not  deductible under section 404(a) to the extent they exceed the applicable  limit under section 402(g). See also Sec. 1.401(a)-30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of matching contributions made on behalf of self- employed individuals. Under section 402(g)(8), matching contributions  made on behalf of a self-employed individual are not treated as elective  contributions made pursuant to a cash or deferred election, without  regard to whether such matching contributions indirectly permit  individual partners to vary the amount of contributions made on their  behalf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Timing of self-employed individual's cash or deferred  election. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, a  partner's compensation is deemed currently available on the last day of  the partnership taxable year and a sole proprietor's compensation is  deemed currently available on the last day of the individual's taxable  year. Accordingly, a self-employed individual may not make a cash or  deferred election with respect to compensation for a partnership or sole  proprietorship taxable year after the last day of that year. See Sec.  1.401(k)-2(a)(4)(ii) for the rules regarding when these contributions  are treated as allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for certain payments to self-employed individuals.  For purposes of sections 401(k) and 401(m), the earned income of a self- employed individual for a taxable year constitutes payment for services  during that year. Thus, for example, if a partnership provides for cash  advance payments during the taxable year to be made to a partner based  on the value of the partner's services prior to the date of payment (and  which do not exceed a reasonable estimate of the partner's earned income  for the taxable year), a   contribution of a portion of these payments to a profit sharing plan in  accordance with an election to defer the portion of the advance payments  does not fail to be made pursuant to a cash or deferred election within  the meaning of paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section merely because the  contribution is made before the amount of the partner's earned income is  finally determined and reported. However, see Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(4)(ii)  for rules on when earned income is treated as received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coverage and nondiscrimination requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  cash or deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (b) for a plan  year only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The group of eligible employees under the cash or deferred  arrangement (including any employees taken into account for purposes of  section 410(b) pursuant to Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(g)(3)(vii)(A)) satisfies  the requirements of section 410(b) (including the average benefit  percentage test, if applicable); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cash or deferred arrangement satisfies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The ADP test of section 401(k)(3) described in Sec. 1.401(k)-2;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The ADP safe harbor provisions of section 401(k)(12) described  in Sec. 1.401(k)-3; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The ADP safe harbor provisions of section 401(k)(13) described  in Sec. 1.401(k)-3; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The SIMPLE 401(k) provisions of section 401(k)(11) described in  Sec. 1.401(k)-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Automatic satisfaction by certain plans. Notwithstanding  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a governmental plan (within the  meaning of section 414(d)) maintained by a State or local government or  political subdivision thereof (or agency or instrumentality thereof)  shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anti-abuse provisions. This section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2  through 1.401(k)-6 are designed to provide simple, practical rules that  accommodate legitimate plan changes. At the same time, the rules are  intended to be applied by employers in a manner that does not make use  of changes in plan testing procedures or other plan provisions to  inflate inappropriately the ADP for NHCEs (which is used as a benchmark  for testing the ADP for HCEs) or to otherwise manipulate the  nondiscrimination testing requirements of this paragraph (b). Further,  this paragraph (b) is part of the overall requirement that benefits or  contributions not discriminate in favor of HCEs. Therefore, a plan will  not be treated as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (b) if  there are repeated changes to plan testing procedures or plan provisions  that have the effect of distorting the ADP so as to increase  significantly the permitted ADP for HCEs, or otherwise manipulate the  nondiscrimination rules of this paragraph, if a principal purpose of the  changes was to achieve such a result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Aggregation and restructuring--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph  (b)(4) contains the exclusive rules for aggregating and disaggregating  plans and cash or deferred arrangements for purposes of this section,  and Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2 through 1.401(k)-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section with respect to all such  arrangements within the plan. Thus, for example, if two groups of  employees are eligible for separate cash or deferred arrangements under  the same plan, all contributions under both cash or deferred  arrangements must be treated as made under a single cash or deferred  arrangement subject to a single test, even if they have significantly  different features, such as different limits on elective contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aggregation of plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For purposes of this  section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2 through 1.401(k)-6, the term plan  means a plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(a) and (b), after  application of the mandatory disaggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(c), and the permissive aggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d), as  modified by paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section. Thus, for example, two  plans (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) that are treated as a  single plan pursuant to the permissive aggregation rules of Sec.  1.410(b)-7(d) are treated as a   single plan for purposes of sections 401(k) and (m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Plans with inconsistent ADP testing methods. Pursuant to  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a single testing method must apply  with respect to all cash or deferred arrangements under a plan. Thus, in  applying the permissive aggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d), an  employer may not aggregate plans (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(b)) that apply inconsistent testing methods. For example, a plan  (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) that applies the current  year testing method may not be aggregated with another plan that applies  the prior year testing method. Similarly, an employer may not aggregate  a plan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) using the ADP safe  harbor provisions of section 401(k)(12) and another plan that is using  the ADP test of section 401(k)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disaggregation of plans and separate testing--(A) In general.  If a cash or deferred arrangement is included in a plan (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) that is mandatorily disaggregated under  the rules of section 410(b) (as modified by this paragraph (b)(4)), the  cash or deferred arrangement must be disaggregated in a consistent  manner. For example, in the case of an employer that is treated as  operating qualified separate lines of business under section 414(r), if  the eligible employees under a cash or deferred arrangement are in more  than one qualified separate line of business, only those employees  within each qualified separate line of business may be taken into  account in determining whether each disaggregated portion of the plan  complies with the requirements of section 401(k), unless the employer is  applying the special rule for employer-wide plans in Sec. 1.414(r)- 1(c)(2)(ii) with respect to the plan. Similarly, if a cash or deferred  arrangement under which employees are permitted to participate before  they have completed the minimum age and service requirements of section  410(a)(1) applies section 410(b)(4)(B) for determining whether the plan  complies with section 410(b)(1), then the arrangement must be treated as  two separate arrangements, one comprising all eligible employees who  have met the age and service requirements of section 410(a)(1) and one  comprising all eligible employees who have not met the age and service  requirements under section 410(a)(1), unless the plan is using the rule  in Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Restructuring prohibited. Restructuring under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 9(c) may not be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of  section 401(k). See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(c)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Modifications to section 410(b) rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Certain  disaggregation rules not applicable. The mandatory disaggregation rules  relating to section 401(k) plans and section 401(m) plans set forth in  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(1) and ESOP and non-ESOP portions of a plan set  forth in Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(2) shall not apply for purposes of this  section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2 through 1.401(k)-6. Accordingly,  notwithstanding Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d)(2), an ESOP and a non-ESOP which are  different plans (within the meaning of section 414(l), as described in  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) are permitted to be aggregated for these purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Permissive aggregation of collective bargaining units.  Notwithstanding the general rule under section 410(b) and Sec.  1.410(b)-7(c) that a plan that benefits employees who are included in a  unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and  employees who are not included in the collective bargaining unit is  treated as comprising separate plans, an employer can treat two or more  separate collective bargaining units as a single collective bargaining  unit for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2 through  1.401(k)-6, provided that the combinations of units are determined on a  basis that is reasonable and reasonably consistent from year to year.  Thus, for example, if a plan benefits employees in three categories  (e.g., employees included in collective bargaining unit A, employees  included in collective bargaining unit B, and employees who are not  included in any collective bargaining unit), the plan can be treated as  comprising three separate plans, each of which benefits only one  category of employees. However, if collective bargaining units A and B  are treated as a single collective bargaining unit, the plan will be  treated as comprising only two separate plans, one benefiting all  employees   who are included in a collective bargaining unit and another benefiting  all other employees. Similarly, if a plan benefits only employees who  are included in collective bargaining unit A and employees who are  included in collective bargaining unit B, the plan can be treated as  comprising two separate plans. However, if collective bargaining units A  and B are treated as a single collective bargaining unit, the plan will  be treated as a single plan. An employee is treated as included in a  unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement if and  only if the employee is a collectively bargained employee within the  meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-6(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em>, the portion of the plan that is maintained pursuant to a  collective bargaining agreement (within the meaning of Sec. 1.413- 1(a)(2)) is treated as a single plan maintained by a single employer  that employs all the employees benefiting under the same benefit  computation formula and covered pursuant to that collective bargaining  agreement. The rules of paragraph (b)(4)(v)(B) of this section  (including the permissive aggregation of collective bargaining units)  apply to the resulting deemed single plan in the same manner as they  would to a single employer plan, except that the plan administrator is  substituted for the employer where appropriate and that appropriate  fiduciary obligations are taken into account. The noncollectively  bargained portion of the plan is treated as maintained by one or more  employers, depending on whether the noncollectively bargaining unit  employees who benefit under the plan are employed by one or more  employers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer A maintains Plan V, a profit-sharing plan  that includes a cash or deferred arrangement in which all of the  employees of Employer A are eligible to participate. For purposes of  applying section 410(b), Employer A is treated as operating qualified  separate lines of business under section 414(r) in accordance with Sec.  1.414(r)-1(b). However, Employer A applies the special rule for  employer-wide plans in Sec. 1.414(r)-1(c)(2)(ii) to the portion of its  profit-sharing plan that consists of elective contributions under the  cash or deferred arrangement (and to no other plans or portions of  plans).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, the requirements of this section and  Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2 through 1.401(k)-6 must be applied on an employer- wide rather than a qualified separate line of business basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer B maintains Plan W, a profit-sharing plan  that includes a cash or deferred arrangement in which all of the  employees of Employer B are eligible to participate. For purposes of  applying section 410(b), the plan treats the cash or deferred  arrangement as two separate plans, one for the employees who have  completed the minimum age and service eligibility conditions under  section 410(a)(1) and the other for employees who have not completed the  conditions. The plan provides that it will satisfy the section 401(k)  safe harbor requirement of Sec. 1.401(k)-3 with respect to the  employees who have met the minimum age and service conditions and that  it will meet the ADP test requirements of Sec. 1.401(k)-2 with respect  to the employees who have not met the minimum age and service  conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, the cash or deferred arrangement must be  disaggregated on a consistent basis with the disaggregation of Plan W.  Thus, the requirements of Sec. 1.401(k)-2 must be applied by comparing  the ADP for eligible HCEs who have not completed the minimum age and  service conditions with the ADP for eligible NHCEs for the applicable  year who have not completed the minimum age and service conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer C maintains Plan X, a stock-bonus plan  including an ESOP. The plan also includes a cash or deferred arrangement  for participants in the ESOP and non-ESOP portions of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section the ESOP and  non-ESOP portions of the stock-bonus plan are a single cash or deferred  arrangement for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(k)-2  through 1.401(k)-6. However, as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(C) of  this section, the ESOP and non-ESOP portions of the plan are still  treated as separate plans for purposes of satisfying the requirements of  section 410(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nonforfeitability requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A cash or  deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (c) only if the amount  attributable to an employee's elective contributions are immediately  nonforfeitable, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,  are disregarded for purposes of applying section 411(a)(2) to other  contributions or benefits, and the contributions remain nonforfeitable  even if the employee makes no additional   elective contributions under a cash or deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of immediately nonforfeitable. An amount is  immediately nonforfeitable if it is immediately nonforfeitable within  the meaning of section 411, and would be nonforfeitable under the plan  regardless of the age and service of the employee or whether the  employee is employed on a specific date. An amount that is subject to  forfeitures or suspensions permitted by section 411(a)(3) does not  satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employees B and C are covered by Employer Y's stock  bonus plan, which includes a cash or deferred arrangement. All employees  participating in the plan have a nonforfeitable right to a percentage of  their account balance derived from all contributions (including elective  contributions) as shown in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Nonforfeitable</p><p class="depth0">Years of service                        percentage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Less than 1..........................................                  0 1....................................................                 20 2....................................................                 40 3....................................................                 60 4....................................................                 80 5 or more............................................                100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cash or deferred arrangement does not satisfy paragraph (c)  of this section because elective contributions are not immediately  nonforfeitable. Thus, the cash or deferred arrangement is a nonqualified  cash or deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Distribution limitation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. A cash or deferred  arrangement satisfies this paragraph (d) only if amounts attributable to  elective contributions may not be distributed before one of the  following events, and any distributions so permitted also satisfy the  additional requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section  (to the extent applicable)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The employee's death, disability, or severance from employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a profit-sharing, stock bonus or rural  cooperative plan, the employee's attainment of age 59\1/2\, or the  employee's hardship; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The termination of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules applicable to distributions upon severance from  employment. An employee has a severance from employment when the  employee ceases to be an employee of the employer maintaining the plan.  An employee does not have a severance from employment if, in connection  with a change of employment, the employee's new employer maintains such  plan with respect to the employee. For example, a new employer maintains  a plan with respect to an employee by continuing or assuming sponsorship  of the plan or by accepting a transfer of plan assets and liabilities  (within the meaning of section 414(l)) with respect to the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rules applicable to hardship distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Distribution  must be on account of hardship. A distribution is treated as made after  an employee's hardship for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this  section if and only if it is made on account of the hardship. For  purposes of this rule, a distribution is made on account of hardship  only if the distribution both is made on account of an immediate and  heavy financial need of the employee and is necessary to satisfy the  financial need. The determination of the existence of an immediate and  heavy financial need and of the amount necessary to meet the need must  be made in accordance with nondiscriminatory and objective standards set  forth in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limit on maximum distributable amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. A  distribution on account of hardship must be limited to the maximum  distributable amount. The maximum distributable amount is equal to the  employee's total elective contributions as of the date of distribution,  reduced by the amount of previous distributions of elective  contributions. Thus, the maximum distributable amount does not include  earnings, QNECs or QMACs, unless grandfathered under paragraph  (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Grandfathered amounts. If the plan so provides, the maximum  distributable amount may be increased for amounts credited to the  employee's account as of a date specified in the plan that is no later  than December 31, 1988, or if later, the end of the last plan year  ending before July 1, 1989 (or in the case of a collectively bargained  plan, the earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The later of January 1, 1989, or the date on which the last of  the collective   bargaining agreements in effect on March 1, 1986 terminates (determined  without regard to any extension thereof after February 28, 1986); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> January 1, 1991 and consisting of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Income allocable to elective contributions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified nonelective contributions and allocable income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Qualified matching contributions and allocable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Immediate and heavy financial need--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Whether an  employee has an immediate and heavy financial need is to be determined  based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, for  example, the need to pay the funeral expenses of a family member would  constitute an immediate and heavy financial need. A distribution made to  an employee for the purchase of a boat or television would generally not  constitute a distribution made on account of an immediate and heavy  financial need. A financial need may be immediate and heavy even if it  was reasonably foreseeable or voluntarily incurred by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deemed immediate and heavy financial need. A distribution is  deemed to be on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the  employee if the distribution is for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Expenses for (or necessary to obtain) medical care that would be  deductible under section 213(d) (determined without regard to whether  the expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs directly related to the purchase of a principal residence  for the employee (excluding mortgage payments);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment of tuition, related educational fees, and room and board  expenses, for up to the next 12 months of post-secondary education for  the employee, or the employee's spouse, children, or dependents (as  defined in section 152, and, for taxable years beginning on or after  January 1, 2005, without regard to section 152(b)(1), (b)(2) and  (d)(1)(B));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the employee from  the employee's principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage on  that residence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Payments for burial or funeral expenses for the employee's  deceased parent, spouse, children or dependents (as defined in section  152, and, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005,  without regard to section 152(d)(1)(B)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Expenses for the repair of damage to the employee's principal  residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under section  165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of  adjusted gross income).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Distribution necessary to satisfy financial need--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  Distribution may not exceed amount of need. A distribution is treated as  necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of an  employee only to the extent the amount of the distribution is not in  excess of the amount required to satisfy the financial need. For this  purpose, the amount required to satisfy the financial need may include  any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income taxes  or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No alternative means available. A distribution is not treated as  necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of an  employee to the extent the need may be relieved from other resources  that are reasonably available to the employee. This determination  generally is to be made on the basis of all the relevant facts and  circumstances. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv), the employee's  resources are deemed to include those assets of the employee's spouse  and minor children that are reasonably available to the employee. Thus,  for example, a vacation home owned by the employee and the employee's  spouse, whether as community property, joint tenants, tenants by the  entirety, or tenants in common, generally will be deemed a resource of  the employee. However, property held for the employee's child under an  irrevocable trust or under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (or  comparable State law) is not treated as a resource of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Employer reliance on employee representation. For purposes of  paragraph   (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, an immediate and heavy financial need  generally may be treated as not capable of being relieved from other  resources that are reasonably available to the employee, if the employer  relies upon the employee's representation (made in writing or such other  form as may be prescribed by the Commissioner), unless the employer has  actual knowledge to the contrary, that the need cannot reasonably be  relieved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> By liquidation of the employee's assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> By cessation of elective contributions or employee contributions  under the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> By other currently available distributions (including  distribution of ESOP dividends under section 404(k)) and nontaxable (at  the time of the loan) loans, under plans maintained by the employer or  by any other employer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> By borrowing from commercial sources on reasonable commercial  terms in an amount sufficient to satisfy the need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Employee need not take counterproductive actions. For purposes  of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv), a need cannot reasonably be relieved by  one of the actions described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section  if the effect would be to increase the amount of the need. For example,  the need for funds to purchase a principal residence cannot reasonably  be relieved by a plan loan if the loan would disqualify the employee  from obtaining other necessary financing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Distribution deemed necessary to satisfy immediate and heavy  financial need. A distribution is deemed necessary to satisfy an  immediate and heavy financial need of an employee if each of the  following requirements are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The employee has obtained all other currently available  distributions (including distribution of ESOP dividends under section  404(k), but not hardship distributions) and nontaxable (at the time of  the loan) loans, under the plan and all other plans maintained by the  employer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employee is prohibited, under the terms of the plan or an  otherwise legally enforceable agreement, from making elective  contributions and employee contributions to the plan and all other plans  maintained by the employer for at least 6 months after receipt of the  hardship distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Definition of other plans. For purposes of paragraph  (d)(3)(iv)(C)(4) and (E)(1) of this section, the phrase plans maintained  by the employer means all qualified and nonqualified plans of deferred  compensation maintained by the employer, including a cash or deferred  arrangement that is part of a cafeteria plan within the meaning of  section 125. However, it does not include the mandatory employee  contribution portion of a defined benefit plan or a health or welfare  benefit plan (including one that is part of a cafeteria plan). In  addition, for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(E)(2) of this section,  the phrase plans maintained by the employer also includes a stock  option, stock purchase, or similar plan maintained by the employer. See  Sec. 1.401(k)-6 for the continued treatment of suspended employees as  eligible employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Commissioner may expand standards. The Commissioner may  prescribe additional guidance of general applicability, published in the  Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter),  expanding the list of deemed immediate and heavy financial needs and  prescribing additional methods for distributions to be deemed necessary  to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules applicable to distributions upon plan termination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No  alternative defined contribution plan. A distribution may not be made  under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section if the employer establishes  or maintains an alternative defined contribution plan. For purposes of  the preceding sentence, the definition of the term ``employer''  contained in Sec. 1.401(k)-6 is applied as of the date of plan  termination, and a plan is an alternative defined contribution plan only  if it is a defined contribution plan that exists at any time during the  period beginning on the date of plan termination and ending 12 months  after distribution of all assets from the terminated plan. However, if  at all times   during the 24-month period beginning 12 months before the date of plan  termination, fewer than 2% of the employees who were eligible under the  defined contribution plan that includes the cash or deferred arrangement  as of the date of plan termination are eligible under the other defined  contribution plan, the other plan is not an alternative defined  contribution plan. In addition, a defined contribution plan is not  treated as an alternative defined contribution plan if it is an employee  stock ownership plan as defined in section 4975(e)(7) or 409(a), a  simplified employee pension as defined in section 408(k), a SIMPLE IRA  plan as defined in section 408(p), a plan or contract that satisfies the  requirements of section 403(b), or a plan that is described in section  457(b) or (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Lump sum requirement for certain distributions. A distribution  may be made under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section only if it is a  lump sum distribution. The term lump sum distribution has the meaning  provided in section 402(e)(4)(D) (without regard to section  402(e)(4)(D)(i)(I), (II), (III) and (IV)). In addition, a lump sum  distribution includes a distribution of an annuity contract from a trust  that is part of a plan described in section 401(a) and which is exempt  from tax under section 501(a) or an annuity plan described in 403(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules applicable to all distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exclusive  distribution rules. Amounts attributable to elective contributions may  not be distributed on account of any event not described in this  paragraph (d), such as completion of a stated period of plan  participation or the lapse of a fixed number of years. For example, if  excess deferrals (and income) for an employee's taxable year are not  distributed within the time prescribed in Sec. 1.402(g)-1(e)(2) or (3),  the amounts may be distributed only on account of an event described in  this paragraph (d). Pursuant to section 401(k)(8), the prohibition on  distributions set forth in this section does not apply to a distribution  of excess contributions under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed distributions. The cost of life insurance (determined  under section 72) is not treated as a distribution for purposes of  section 401(k)(2) and this paragraph (d). The making of a loan is not  treated as a distribution, even if the loan is secured by the employee's  accrued benefit attributable to elective contributions or is includible  in the employee's income under section 72(p). However, the reduction, by  reason of default on a loan, of an employee's accrued benefit derived  from elective contributions is treated as a distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ESOP dividend distributions. A plan does not fail to satisfy  the requirements of this paragraph (d) merely by reason of a dividend  distribution described in section 404(k)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limitations apply after transfer. The limitations of this  paragraph (d) generally continue to apply to amounts attributable to  elective contributions (including QNECs and qualified matching  contributions taken into account for the ADP test under Sec. 1.401(k)- 2(a)(6)) that are transferred to another qualified plan of the same or  another employer. Thus, the transferee plan will generally fail to  satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) and this section if  transferred amounts may be distributed before the times specified in  this paragraph (d). In addition, a cash or deferred arrangement fails to  satisfy the limitations of this paragraph (d) if it transfers amounts to  a plan that does not provide that the transferred amounts may not be  distributed before the times specified in this paragraph (d). The  transferor plan does not fail to comply with the preceding sentence if  it reasonably concludes that the transferee plan provides that the  transferred amounts may not be distributed before the times specified in  this paragraph (d). What constitutes a basis for a reasonable conclusion  is determined under standards comparable to those under the rules  related to acceptance of rollover distributions. See Sec. 1.401(a)(31)- 1, A-14. The limitations of this paragraph (d) cease to apply after the  transfer, however, if the amounts could have been distributed at the  time of the transfer (other than on account of hardship), and the  transfer is an elective transfer described in Sec. 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-; 3(b)(1). The limitations of this paragraph (d) also do not apply to   amounts that have been paid in a direct rollover to the plan after being  distributed by another plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer M maintains Plan V, a profit-sharing plan that  includes a cash or deferred arrangement. Elective contributions under  the arrangement may be withdrawn for any reason after two years  following the end of the plan year in which the contributions were made.  Because the plan permits distributions of elective contributions before  the occurrence of one of the events specified in section 401(k)(2)(B)  and this paragraph (d), the cash or deferred arrangement is a  nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement and the elective contributions  are currently includible in income under section 402.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer N maintains Plan W, a profit-sharing plan  that includes a cash or deferred arrangement. Plan W provides for  distributions upon a participant's severance from employment, death or  disability. All employees of Employer N and its wholly owned subsidiary,  Employer O, are eligible to participate in Plan W. Employer N agrees to  sell all issued and outstanding shares of Employer O to an unrelated  entity, Employer T, effective on December 31, 2006. Following the  transaction, Employer O will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Employer T.  Additionally, individuals who are employed by Employer O on the  effective date of the sale continue to be employed by Employer O  following the sale. Following the transaction, all employees of Employer  O will cease to participate in Plan W and will become eligible to  participate in the cash or deferred arrangement maintained by Employer  T, Plan X. No assets will be transferred from Plan W to Plan X, except  in the case of a direct rollover within the meaning of section  401(a)(31).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer O ceases to be a member of Employer N's controlled  group as a result of the sale. Therefore, employees of Employer O who  participated in Plan W will have a severance from employment and are  eligible to receive a distribution from Plan W.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer Q maintains Plan Y, a profit-sharing plan  that includes a cash or deferred arrangement. Plan Y, the only plan  maintained by Employer Q, does not provide for loans. However, Plan Y  provides that elective contributions under the arrangement may be  distributed to an eligible employee on account of hardship using the  deemed immediate and heavy financial need provisions of paragraph  (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section and provisions regarding distributions  necessary to satisfy financial need of paragraphs (d)(3)(iv)(A) through  (D) of this section. Employee A is an eligible employee in Plan Y with  an account balance of $50,000 attributable to elective contributions  made by Employee A. The total amount of elective contributions made by  Employee A, who has not previously received a distribution from Plan Y,  is $20,000. Employee A requests a $15,000 hardship distribution of his  elective contributions to pay 6 months of college tuition and room and  board expenses for his dependent. At the time of the distribution  request, the sole asset of Employee A (that is reasonably available to  Employee A within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this  section) is a savings account with an available balance of $10,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A distribution is made on account of hardship only if the  distribution both is made on account of an immediate and heavy financial  need of the employee and is necessary to satisfy the financial need.  Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, a distribution for  payment of up to the next 12 months of post-secondary education and room  and board expenses for Employee A's dependent is deemed to be on account  of an immediate and heavy financial need of Employee A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A distribution is treated as necessary to satisfy Employee A's  immediate and heavy financial need to the extent the need may not be  relieved from other resources reasonably available to Employee A. Under  paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, Employee A's $10,000 savings  account is a resource that is reasonably available to the employee and  must be taken into account in determining the amount necessary to  satisfy Employee A's immediate and heavy financial need. Thus, Employee  A may receive a distribution of only $5,000 of his elective  contributions on account of this hardship, plus an amount necessary to  pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably  anticipated to result from the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3. Employee B,  another employee of Employer Q has an account balance of $25,000,  attributable to Employee B's elective contributions. The total amount of  elective contributions made by Employee B, who has not previously  received a distribution from Plan Y, is $15,000. Employee B requests a  $10,000 distribution of his elective contributions to pay 6 months of  college tuition and room and board expenses for his child. Employee B  makes a written representation (with respect to which Employer Q has no  actual knowledge to the contrary) that the need cannot reasonably be  relieved:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By liquidation of the employee's assets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> By cessation of elective contributions or employee contributions  under the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> By other distributions or nontaxable (at the time of the loan)  loans from plans   maintained by the employer or by any other employer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> By borrowing from commercial sources on reasonable commercial  terms in an amount sufficient to satisfy the need.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, a distribution  for payment of up to the next 12 months of post-secondary education and  room and board expenses for Employee B's child is deemed to be on  account of an Employee B's immediate and heavy financial need. In  addition, because Employer Q can rely on Employee B's written  representation, the distribution is considered necessary to satisfy  Employee B's immediate and heavy financial need. Therefore, Employee B  may receive a $10,000 distribution of his elective contributions on  account of hardship plus an amount necessary to pay any federal, state,  or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from  the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except Plan Y  provides for hardship distributions using the safe harbor rule of  paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(E) of this section. Accordingly, Plan Y provides  for a 6 month suspension of an eligible employee's elective  contributions and employee contributions to the plan after the receipt  of a hardship distribution by such eligible employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, a distribution  for payment of up to the next 12 months of post-secondary education and  room and board expenses for Employee A's dependent is deemed to be on  account of an Employee A's immediate and heavy financial need. In  addition, because Employee A is not eligible for any other distribution  or loan from Plan Y and Plan Y suspends Employee A's elective  contributions and employee contributions following receipt of the  hardship distribution, the distribution will be deemed necessary to  satisfy Employee A's immediate and heavy financial need (and Employee A  is not required to first liquidate his savings account). Therefore,  Employee A may receive a $15,000 distribution of his elective  contributions on account of hardship plus an amount necessary to pay any  federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably  anticipated to result from the distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Employer R maintains a pre-ERISA money purchase pension  plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement that is not a rural  cooperative plan. Elective contributions under the arrangement may be  distributed to an employee on account of hardship. Under paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, hardship is a permissible distribution event  only in a profit-sharing, stock bonus or rural cooperative plan. Since  elective contributions under the arrangement may be distributed before a  permissible distribution event occurs, the cash or deferred arrangement  does not satisfy this paragraph (d), and is not a qualified cash or  deferred arrangement. Moreover, the plan is not a qualified plan because  a money purchase pension plan may not provide for payment of benefits  upon hardship. See Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional requirements for qualified cash or deferred  arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified plan requirement. A cash or deferred  arrangement satisfies this paragraph (e) only if the plan of which it is  a part is a profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money purchase or  rural cooperative plan that otherwise satisfies the requirements of  section 401(a) (taking into account the cash or deferred arrangement). A  plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement may provide for other  contributions, including employer contributions (other than elective  contributions), employee contributions, or both. However, except as  expressly permitted under section 401(m), 410(b)(2)(A)(ii) or  416(c)(2)(A), elective contributions and matching contributions taken  into account under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a) may not be taken into account for  purposes of determining whether any other contributions under any plan  (including the plan to which the contributions are made) satisfy the  requirements of section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cash must be available. A cash or  deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (e) only if the  arrangement provides that the amount that each eligible employee may  defer as an elective contribution is available to the employee in cash.  Thus, for example, if an eligible employee is provided the option to  receive a taxable benefit (other than cash) or to have the employer  contribute on the employee's behalf to a profit-sharing plan an amount  equal to the value of the taxable benefit, the arrangement is not a  qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Similarly, if an employee has  the option to receive a specified amount in cash or to have the employer  contribute an amount in excess of the specified cash amount to a profit- sharing plan on the employee's behalf, any contribution made by the  employer on the employee's behalf in excess of the specified cash amount  is not treated as made pursuant to a qualified cash or deferred  arrangement, but   would be treated as a matching contribution. This cash availability  requirement applies even if the cash or deferred arrangement is part of  a cafeteria plan within the meaning of section 125.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Frequency of elections. A cash or deferred arrangement  satisfies this paragraph (e) only if the arrangement provides an  employee with an effective opportunity to make (or change) a cash or  deferred election at least once during each plan year. Whether an  employee has an effective opportunity is determined based on all the  relevant facts and circumstances, including the adequacy of notice of  the availability of the election, the period of time during which an  election may be made, and any other conditions on elections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> applies at the time  the elective contribution is contributed to the plan and continues to  apply until the contribution is distributed under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Satisfaction of separate accounting requirement. The  requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section are treated as  satisfied if all amounts held under a plan that includes a qualified  cash or deferred arrangement (and, if applicable, under another plan to  which QNECs and QMACs are made) are subject to the requirements of  paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitations on cash or deferred arrangements of state and local  governments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A cash or deferred arrangement does not  satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (e) if the arrangement is  adopted after May 6, 1986, by a State or local government or political  subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality thereof (a  governmental unit). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), an employer  that has made a legally binding commitment to adopt a cash or deferred  arrangement is treated as having adopted the arrangement on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adoption after May 6, 1986. A cash or deferred arrangement is  treated as adopted after May 6, 1986, with respect to all employees of  any employer that adopts the arrangement after such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Adoption before May 7, 1986. If a governmental unit adopted a  cash or deferred arrangement before May 7, 1986, then any cash or  deferred arrangement adopted by the unit at any time is treated as  adopted before that date. If an employer adopted an arrangement prior to  such date, all employees of the employer may participate in the  arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> One-year eligibility requirement. A cash or deferred arrangement  satisfies this paragraph (e) only if no employee is required to complete  a period of service with the employer maintaining the plan extending  beyond the period permitted under section 410(a)(1) (determined without  regard to section 410(a)(1)(B)(i)) to be eligible to make a cash or  deferred election under the arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other benefits not contingent upon elective contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. A cash or deferred arrangement satisfies   this paragraph (e) only if no other benefit is conditioned (directly or  indirectly) upon the employee's electing to make or not to make elective  contributions under the arrangement. The preceding sentence does not  apply to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any matching contribution (as defined in Sec. 1.401(m)-1(a)(2))  made by reason of such an election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any benefit, right or feature (such as a plan loan) that  requires, or results in, an amount to be withheld from an employee's pay  (e.g. to pay for the benefit or to repay the loan), to the extent the  cash or deferred arrangement restricts elective contributions to amounts  available after such withholding from the employee's pay (after  deduction of all applicable income and employment taxes);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any reduction in the employer's top-heavy contributions under  section 416(c)(2) because of matching contributions that resulted from  the elective contributions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any benefit that is provided at the employee's election under a  plan described in section 125(d) in lieu of an elective contribution  under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of other benefits. For purposes of this paragraph  (e)(6), other benefits include, but are not limited to, benefits under a  defined benefit plan; nonelective contributions under a defined  contribution plan; the availability, cost, or amount of health benefits;  vacations or vacation pay; life insurance; dental plans; legal services  plans; loans (including plan loans); financial planning services;  subsidized retirement benefits; stock options; property subject to  section 83; and dependent care assistance. Also, increases in salary,  bonuses or other cash remuneration (other than the amount that would be  contributed under the cash or deferred election) are benefits for  purposes of this paragraph (e)(6). The ability to make after-tax  employee contributions is a benefit, but that benefit is not contingent  upon an employee's electing to make or not make elective contributions  under the arrangement merely because the amount of elective  contributions reduces dollar-for-dollar the amount of after-tax employee  contributions that may be made. Additionally, benefits under any other  plan or arrangement (whether or not qualified) are not contingent upon  an employee's electing to make or not to make elective contributions  under a cash or deferred arrangement merely because the elective  contributions are or are not taken into account as compensation under  the other plan or arrangement for purposes of determining benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of certain statutory limits. Any benefit under an  excess benefit plan described in section 3(36) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 829), Public Law 93- 406, that is dependent on the employee's electing to make or not to make  elective contributions is not treated as contingent. Deferred  compensation under a nonqualified plan of deferred compensation that is  dependent on an employee's having made the maximum elective deferrals  under section 402(g) or the maximum elective contributions permitted  under the terms of the plan also is not treated as contingent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nonqualified deferred compensation. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section, participation in a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan is treated as contingent for  purposes of this paragraph (e)(6) to the extent that an employee may  receive additional deferred compensation under the nonqualified plan to  the extent the employee makes or does not make elective contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Plan loans and distributions. A loan or distribution of elective  contributions is not a benefit conditioned on an employee's electing to  make or not make elective contributions under the arrangement merely  because the amount of the loan or distribution is based on the amount of  the employee's account balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (e)(6):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer T maintains a cash or deferred arrangement for  all of its employees. Employer T also maintains a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan for two highly paid executives, Employees R and C.  Under the terms of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, R and C  are eligible to participate only if they do not make elective  contributions under the cash or deferred arrangement. Participation in  the nonqualified plan is a contingent benefit for purposes of   this paragraph (e)(6), because R's and C's participation is conditioned  on their electing not to make elective contributions under the cash or  deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer T maintains a cash or deferred arrangement for  all its employees. Employer T also maintains a nonqualified deferred  compensation plan for two highly paid executives, Employees R and C.  Under the terms of the arrangements, Employees R and C may defer a  maximum of 10% of their compensation, and may allocate their deferral  between the cash or deferred arrangement and the nonqualified deferred  compensation plan in any way they choose (subject to the overall 10%  maximum). Because the maximum deferral available under the nonqualified  deferred compensation plan depends on the elective deferrals made under  the cash or deferred arrangement, the right to participate in the  nonqualified plan is a contingent benefit for purposes of this paragraph  (e)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em>, a plan may incorporate by reference the provisions of section  401(k)(3) and Sec. 1.401(k)-2 if that is the nondiscrimination test  being applied.

With respect to compensation  that is paid (or would have been paid but for a cash or deferred  election) in plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, a cash or  deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (e) only if cash or  deferred elections can only be made with respect to amounts that are  compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3) and Sec. 1.415(c)- 2. Thus, for example, the arrangement is not a qualified cash or  deferred arrangement if an eligible employee who is not in qualified  military service (as that term is defined in section 414(u)) and who is  not permanently and totally disabled (as defined in section 22(e)(3))  can make a cash or deferred election with respect to an amount paid  after severance from employment, unless the amount is paid by the later  of 2\1/2\ months after severance from employment or the end of the year  that includes the date of severance from employment and is described in  Sec. 1.415(c)-2(e)(3)(ii) or (iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special rules for designated Roth contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  The term designated Roth contribution means an elective contribution  under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement that, to the extent  permitted under the plan, is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Designated irrevocably by the employee at the time of the cash  or deferred election as a designated Roth contribution that is being  made in lieu of all or a portion of the pre-tax elective contributions  the employee is otherwise eligible to make under the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treated by the employer as not excludible from the employee's  gross income (in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maintained by the plan in a separate account (in accordance  with paragraph (f)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(B)</em> may be allocated to such account. The separate accounting  requirement applies at the time the designated Roth contribution is  contributed to the plan and must continue to apply until the designated  Roth account is completely distributed. A-13 of Sec. 1.402A-1 for  additional requirements for separate accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Designated Roth contributions must satisfy rules applicable to  elective contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A designated Roth contribution  must satisfy the requirements applicable to elective contributions made  under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Thus, for example, a  designated Roth contribution must satisfy the requirements of paragraphs  (c) and (d) of this section and is treated as an employer contribution  for purposes of sections 401(a), 401(k), 402, 404, 409, 411, 412, 415,  416 and 417. In addition, the designated Roth contributions are treated  as elective contributions for purposes of the ADP test. Similarly, the  designated Roth account under the plan is subject to the rules of  section 401(a)(9)(A) and (B) in the same manner as an account that  contains pre-tax elective contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules for direct rollovers. A direct rollover from a  designated Roth account under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement  may only be made to another designated Roth account under an applicable  retirement plan described in section 402A(e)(1) or to a Roth IRA  described in section 408A, and only to the extent the rollover is  permitted under the rules of section 402(c). Moreover, a participant's  designated Roth account and the participant's other accounts under a  plan are treated as accounts held under two separate plans (within the  meaning of section 414(l)) for purposes of applying the automatic  rollover rules for mandatory distributions under section  401(a)(31)(B)(i)(I) and the special rules in A-9 through A-11 of Sec.  1.401(a)(31)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rules regarding designated Roth contribution elections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Frequency of elections. The rules under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this  section regarding frequency of elections apply in the same manner to  both pre-tax elective contributions and designated Roth contributions.

The ADP for a group of  eligible employees (either eligible HCEs or eligible NHCEs) for a plan  year or applicable year is the average of the ADRs of the eligible  employees in that group for that year.

The ADP test is applied using the prior year  testing method or the current year testing method. Under the prior year  testing method, the applicable year for determining the ADP for the  eligible NHCEs is the plan year immediately preceding the plan year for  which the ADP test is being performed. Under the prior year testing  method, the ADP for the eligible NHCEs is determined using the ADRs for  the eligible employees who were NHCEs in that preceding plan year,  regardless of whether those NHCEs are eligible employees or NHCEs in the  plan year for which the ADP test is being calculated. Under the current  year testing method, the applicable year for determining the ADP for the  eligible NHCEs is the same plan year as the plan year for which the ADP  test is being performed. Under either method, the ADP for eligible HCEs  is the average of the ADRs of the eligible HCEs for the plan year for  which the ADP test is being performed.

The ADR of an eligible  employee for a plan year or applicable year is the sum of the employee's  elective contributions taken into account with respect to such employee  for the year, determined under the rules of paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of  this section, and the qualified nonelective contributions and qualified  matching contributions taken into account with respect to such employee  under paragraph (a)(6) of this section for the year, divided by the  employee's compensation taken into account for the year. The ADR is  calculated to the nearest hundredth of a percentage point. If no  elective contributions, qualified nonelective contributions, or  qualified matching contributions are taken into account under this  section with respect to an eligible employee for the year, the ADR of  the employee is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ADR of HCEs eligible under more than one arrangement--(A)  General rule. Pursuant to section 401(k)(3)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, the ADR of an HCE who is  an eligible employee in more than one cash or deferred arrangement of  the same employer is calculated by treating all contributions with  respect to such HCE under any such arrangement as being made under the  cash or deferred arrangement being tested. Thus, the ADR for such an HCE  is calculated by accumulating all contributions under any cash or  deferred arrangement (other than a cash or deferred arrangement  described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) that would be  taken into account under this section for the plan year, if the cash or  deferred arrangement under which the contribution was made applied this  section and had the same plan year. For example, in the case of a plan  with a 12-month plan year, the ADR for the plan year of that plan for an  HCE who participates in multiple cash or deferred arrangements of the  same employer is the sum of all contributions during such 12-month  period that would be taken into account with respect to the HCE under  all such arrangements in which the HCE is an eligible employee, divided  by the HCE's compensation for that 12-month period (determined using the  compensation definition for the plan being tested), without regard to  the plan year of the other plans and whether those plans are satisfying  this section or Sec. 1.401(k)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> and the prohibition on aggregating plans with  different plan years set forth in Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d)(5)) are not  aggregated under this paragraph (a)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples.

For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4), a partner's  distributive share of partnership income is treated as received on the  last day of the partnership taxable year and a sole proprietor's  compensation is treated as received on the last day of the individual's  taxable year. Thus, an elective contribution made on behalf of a partner  or sole proprietor is treated as allocated to the partner's account for  the plan year that includes the last day of the partnership taxable  year, provided the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section  are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Elective contributions for HCEs.

The plan that contains the cash  or deferred arrangement and the plan or plans to which the qualified  nonelective contributions or qualified matching contributions are made,  are plans that would be permitted to be aggregated under Sec. 1.401(k)- 1(b)(4). If the plan year of the plan that contains the cash or deferred  arrangement is changed to satisfy the requirement under Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(d)(5) that aggregated plans have the same plan year, qualified  nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions may be  taken into account in the resulting short plan year only if such  qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions  could have been taken into account under an ADP test for a plan with the  same short plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disproportionate contributions not taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  General rule. Qualified nonelective contributions cannot be taken into  account for a plan year for an NHCE to the extent such contributions  exceed the product of that NHCE's compensation and the greater of 5% or  two times the plan's representative contribution rate. Any qualified  nonelective contribution taken into account under an ACP test under  Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(6) (including the determination of the  representative contribution rate for purposes of Sec. 1.401(m)- 2(a)(6)(v)(B)), is not permitted to be taken into account for purposes  of this paragraph (a)(6) (including the determination of the  representative contribution rate under paragraph (a)(6)(iv)(B) of this  section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Definition of representative contribution rate. For purposes of  this paragraph (a)(6)(iv), the plan's representative contribution rate  is the lowest applicable contribution rate of any eligible NHCE among a  group of eligible NHCEs that consists of half of all eligible NHCEs for  the plan year (or, if greater, the lowest applicable contribution rate  of any eligible NHCE in the group of all eligible NHCEs for the plan  year and who is employed by the employer on the last day of the plan  year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Definition of applicable contribution rate. For purposes of this  paragraph (a)(6)(iv), the applicable contribution rate for an eligible  NHCE is the sum of the qualified matching contributions taken into  account under this paragraph (a)(6) for the eligible NHCE for the plan  year and the qualified nonelective contributions made for the eligible  NHCE for the plan year, divided by the eligible NHCE's compensation for  the same period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Special rule for prevailing wage contributions. Notwithstanding  paragraph (a)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, qualified nonelective  contributions that are made in connection with an employer's obligation  to pay prevailing wages under the Davis-Bacon Act (46 Stat. 1494),  Public Law 71-798, Service Contract Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 1965), Public  Law 89-286, or similar legislation can be taken into account for a plan  year for an NHCE to the extent such contributions do not exceed 10  percent of that NHCE's compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Qualified matching contributions. Qualified matching  contributions satisfy this paragraph (a)(6) only to the extent that such  qualified matching contributions are matching contributions that are not  precluded from being taken into account under the ACP test for the plan  year under the rules of Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(5)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Contributions only used once. Qualified nonelective  contributions and qualified matching contributions cannot be taken into  account under this paragraph (a)(6) to the extent such contributions are  taken into account for purposes of satisfying any other ADP test, any  ACP test, or the requirements of Sec. 1.401(k)-3, 1.401(m)-3 or  1.401(k)-4. Thus, for example, matching contributions that are made  pursuant to Sec. 1.401(k)-3(c) cannot be taken into account under the  ADP test. Similarly, if a plan switches from the current year testing  method to the prior year testing method pursuant to Sec. 1.401(k)-2(c),  qualified nonelective contributions that are taken into account under  the current year testing method for a year may not be taken into account  under the prior year testing method for the next year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples.

The ADP for the NHCEs is 3.71% (the sum of the individual ADRs,  26%, divided by 7 employees). Because 7.5% exceeds 4.64% (3.71% x 1.25),  Plan T does not satisfy the ADP test under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this  section. In addition, because the ADP for the HCEs exceeds the ADP for  the NHCEs by more than 2 percentage points, Plan T does not satisfy the  ADP test under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

A plan may provide for the  use of any of the correction methods described in   paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may limit elective contributions in  a manner designed to prevent excess contributions from being made, or  may use a combination of these methods, to avoid or correct excess  contributions. A plan may permit an HCE to elect whether any excess  contributions are to be recharacterized or distributed. Similarly, a  plan may permit an HCE with elective contributions for a year that  includes both pre-tax elective contributions and designated Roth  contributions to elect whether the excess contributions are to be  attributed to pre-tax elective contributions or designated Roth  contributions. If the plan uses a combination of correction methods, any  contribution made under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section must be  taken into account before application of the correction methods in  paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclusive means of correction. A failure to satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not be corrected  using any method other than the ones described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)  and (ii) of this section. Thus, excess contributions for a plan year may  not remain unallocated or be allocated to a suspense account for  allocation to one or more employees in any future year. In addition,  excess contributions may not be corrected using the retroactive  correction rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(g).

This  paragraph (b)(2) contains the rules for correction of excess  contributions through a distribution from the plan. Correction through a  distribution generally involves a 4-step process. First, the plan must  determine, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the  total amount of excess contributions that must be distributed under the  plan. Second, the plan must apportion the total amount of excess  contributions among HCEs in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of  this section. Third, the plan must determine the income allocable to  excess contributions in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this  section. Finally, the plan must distribute the apportioned excess  contributions and allocable income in accordance with paragraph  (b)(2)(v) of this section. Paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section provides  rules relating to the tax treatment of these distributions. Paragraph  (b)(2)(vii) provides other rules relating to these distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of total amount to be distributed. The following  procedures must be used to determine the total amount of the excess  contributions to be distributed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the dollar amount of excess contributions for each  HCE. The amount of excess contributions attributable to a given HCE for  a plan year is the amount (if any) by which the HCE's contributions  taken into account under this section must be reduced for the HCE's ADR  to equal the highest permitted ADR under the plan. To calculate the  highest permitted ADR under a plan, the ADR of the HCE with the highest  ADR is reduced by the amount required to cause that HCE's ADR to equal  the ADR of the HCE with the next highest ADR. If a lesser reduction  would enable the arrangement to satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, only this lesser reduction is used in  determining the highest permitted ADR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination of the total amount of excess contributions. The  process described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be  repeated until the arrangement would satisfy the requirements of  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. The sum of all reductions for  all HCEs determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is the  total amount of excess contributions for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> if the arrangement would satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section if the ADR for each  HCE were determined after the reductions described in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Apportionment of total amount of excess contributions among  the HCEs. The following procedures must be used in apportioning the  total amount of excess contributions determined under paragraph  (b)(2)(ii) of this section among the HCEs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the dollar amount of excess contributions for each  HCE. The contributions of the HCE with the highest dollar amount of  contributions taken into account under this section are reduced by the  amount required to cause that HCE's contributions to equal the dollar  amount of the contributions taken into account under this section for  the HCE with the next highest dollar amount of contributions taken into  account under this section. If a lesser apportionment to the HCE would  enable the plan to apportion the total amount of excess contributions,  only the lesser apportionment would apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limit on amount apportioned to any individual. For purposes of  this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), the amount of contributions taken into  account under this section with respect to an HCE who is an eligible  employee in more than one plan of an employer is determined by taking  into account all contributions otherwise taken into account with respect  to such HCE under any plan of the employer during the plan year of the  plan being tested as being made under the plan being tested. However,  the amount of excess contributions apportioned for a plan year with  respect to any HCE must not exceed the amount of contributions actually  contributed to the plan for the HCE for the plan year. Thus, in the case  of an HCE who is an eligible employee in more than one plan of the same  employer to which elective contributions are made and whose ADR is  calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the  amount required to be distributed under this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) shall  not exceed the contributions actually contributed to the plan and taken  into account under this section for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Apportionment to additional HCEs. The procedure in paragraph  (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section must be repeated until the total amount  of excess contributions determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this  section has been apportioned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income allocable to excess contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule. For  plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the income allocable  to excess contributions is equal to the allocable gain or loss through  the end of the plan year. See paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) of this section  for rules that apply to plan years beginning before January 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Method of allocating income. A plan may use any reasonable  method for computing the income allocable to excess contributions,  provided that the method does not violate section 401(a)(4), is used  consistently for all participants and for all corrective distributions  under the plan for the plan year, and is used by the plan for allocating  income to participant's accounts. See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(8). A plan  will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income  allocable to excess contributions merely because the income allocable to  excess contributions is determined on a date that is no more than 7 days  before the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Alternative method of allocating plan year income. A plan may  allocate income to excess contributions for the plan year by multiplying  the income for the plan year allocable to the elective contributions and  other amounts taken into account under this section (including  contributions made for the plan year), by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the excess contributions for the employee for the plan year,  and the denominator of which is the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Account balance attributable to elective contributions and other  contributions taken into account under this section as of the beginning  of the plan year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any additional amount of such contributions made for the plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Plan years before 2008. For plan years beginning before January  1, 2008, the income allocable to excess contributions is determined  under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(2)(iv) (as it appeared in the April 1, 2007,  edition of 26 CFR part 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> and paragraph (b)(4)(i)  of this section, a distribution   of excess contributions must be in addition to any other distributions  made during the year and must be designated as a corrective distribution  by the employer. In the event of a complete termination of the plan  during the plan year in which an excess contribution arose, the  corrective distribution must be made as soon as administratively  feasible after the date of termination of the plan, but in no event  later than 12 months after the date of termination. If the entire  account balance of an HCE is distributed prior to when the plan makes a  distribution of excess contributions in accordance with this paragraph  (b)(2), the distribution is deemed to have been a corrective  distribution of excess contributions (and income) to the extent that a  corrective distribution would otherwise have been required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tax treatment of corrective distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corrective  distributions for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008.  Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(vi), for plan years  beginning on or after January 1, 2008, a corrective distribution of  excess contributions (and allocable income) is includible in the  employee's gross income for the employee's taxable year in which  distributed. In addition, the corrective distribution is not subject to  the early distribution tax of section 72(t). See paragraph (b)(5) of  this section for additional rules relating to the employer excise tax on  amounts distributed more than 2\1/2\ months (6 months in the case of  certain plans that include an eligible automatic contribution  arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w)) after the end of the  plan year.

The tax treatment of corrective distributions for plan years  beginning before January 1, 2008, is determined under Sec. 1.401(k)- 2(b)(2)(vi) (as it appeared in the April 1, 2007, edition of 26 CFR Part  1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Corrective distributions attributable to designated Roth  contributions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2)(vi)(A) and (B) of this  section, a distribution of excess contributions is not includible in  gross income to the extent it represents a distribution of designated  Roth contributions. However, the income allocable to a corrective  distribution of excess contributions that are designated Roth  contributions is included in gross income in accordance with paragraph  (b)(2)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section (i.e., in the same manner as income  allocable to a corrective distribution of excess contributions that are  pre-tax elective contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Other rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No employee or spousal consent required.

For the 2006 plan year, Employee A, an HCE, has elective  contributions of $12,000 and $200,000 in compensation, for an ADR of 6%,  and Employee B, a second HCE, has elective contributions of $8,960 and  compensation of $128,000, for an ADR of 7%. The ADP for the NHCEs is 3%  for the 2006 plan year. Under the ADP test, the ADP of the two HCEs   under the plan may not exceed 5% (i.e., 2 percentage points more than  the ADP of the NHCEs under the plan). The ADP for the 2 HCEs under the  plan is 6.5%. Therefore, there must be a correction of excess  contributions for the 2006 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section as follows: the  elective contributions of Employee B (the HCE with the highest ADR) are  reduced by $1,280 in order to reduce his ADR to 6% ($7,680/$128,000),  which is the ADR of Employee A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the ADP of the HCEs determined after the $1,280  reduction to Employee B still exceeds 5%, further reductions in elective  contributions are necessary in order to reduce the ADP of the HCEs to  5%. The elective contributions of Employee A and Employee B are each  reduced by 1% of compensation ($2,000 and $1,280 respectively). Because  the ADP of the HCEs determined after the reductions equals 5%, the plan  would satisfy the requirements of (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The total amount of excess contributions ($4,560 =  $1,280+$2,000+$1,280) is apportioned among the HCEs under paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) of this section first to the HCE with the highest amount of  elective contributions. Therefore, Employee A is apportioned $3,040 (the  amount required to cause Employee A's elective contributions to equal  the next highest dollar amount of elective contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Because the total amount of excess contributions has not been  apportioned, further apportionment is necessary. The balance ($1,520) of  the total amount of excess contributions is apportioned equally among  Employee A and Employee B ($760 to each).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Therefore, the cash or deferred arrangement will satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if, by the end of the  12 month period following the end of the 2006 plan year, Employee A  receives a corrective distribution of excess contributions equal to  $3,800 ($3,040 + $760) and allocable income and Employee B receives a  corrective distribution of $760 and allocable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  Employee A's ADR is based on $3,000 of elective contributions to this  plan and $9,000 of elective contributions to another plan of the  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total amount of excess contributions ($4,560 =  $1,280+$2,000+$1,280) is apportioned among the HCEs under paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) of this section first to the HCE with the highest amount of  elective contributions. The amount of elective contributions for  Employee A is $12,000. Therefore, Employee A is apportioned $3,040 (the  amount required to cause Employee A's elective contributions to equal  the next highest dollar amount of elective contributions). However,  pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, no more than the  amount actually contributed to the plan may be apportioned to an HCE.  Accordingly, no more than $3,000 may be apportioned to Employee A.  Therefore, the remaining $1,560 must be apportioned to Employee B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cash or deferred arrangement will satisfy the requirements  of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if, by the end of the 12 month  period following the end of the 2006 plan year, Employee A receives a  corrective distribution of excess contributions equal to $3,000 (total  amount of elective contributions actually contributed to the plan for  Employee A) and allocable income and Employee B receives a corrective  distribution of $1,560 and allocable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recharacterization of excess contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.  Excess contributions are recharacterized in accordance with this  paragraph (b)(3) only if the excess contributions that would have to be  distributed under (b)(2) of this section if the plan was correcting  through distribution of excess contributions are recharacterized as  described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, and all of the  conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section are  satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of recharacterized excess contributions.  Recharacterized excess contributions are includible in the employee's  gross income as if such amounts were distributed under paragraph (b)(2)  of this section. The recharacterized excess contributions are treated as  employee contributions for purposes of section 72, sections 401(a)(4),  401(m), Sec. 1.401(k)-1(d) and Sec. 1.401(k)-2. This requirement is  not treated as satisfied unless the payor or plan administrator reports  the recharacterized excess contributions as employee contributions to  the Internal Revenue Service and the employee by timely providing such  Federal tax forms and accompanying instructions and timely taking such  other action as is prescribed by the Commissioner in revenue rulings,  notices and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin  (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) as well as the applicable  Federal tax forms and accompanying instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Time of recharacterization. Excess  contributions may not be recharacterized under this   paragraph (b)(3) after 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year to  which the recharacterization relates. Recharacterization is deemed to  have occurred on the date on which the last of those HCEs with excess  contributions to be recharacterized is notified in accordance with  paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employee contributions must be permitted under plan. The amount  of recharacterized excess contributions, in combination with the  employee contributions actually made by the HCE, may not exceed the  maximum amount of employee contributions (determined without regard to  the ACP test of section 401(m)(2)) permitted under the provisions of the  plan as in effect on the first day of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Treatment of recharacterized excess contributions.  Recharacterized excess contributions continue to be treated as employer  contributions for all purposes under the Internal Revenue Code (other  than those specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section), including  section 401(a) and sections 404, 409, 411, 412, 415, 416, and 417. Thus,  for example, recharacterized excess contributions remain subject to the  requirements of Sec. 1.401(k)-1(c); must be deducted under section 404;  and are treated as employer contributions described in section  415(c)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules applicable to all corrections--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Coordination with  distribution of excess deferrals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Treatment of excess deferrals that  reduce excess contributions. The amount of excess contributions (and  allocable income) to be distributed under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section or the amount of excess contributions recharacterized under  paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to an employee for a plan  year, is reduced by any amounts previously distributed to the employee  from the plan to correct excess deferrals for the employee's taxable  year ending with or within the plan year in accordance with section  402(g)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Treatment of excess contributions that reduce excess deferrals.  Under Sec. 1.402(g)-1(e), the amount required to be distributed to  correct an excess deferral to an employee for a taxable year is reduced  by any excess contributions (and allocable income) previously  distributed or excess contributions recharacterized with respect to the  employee for the plan year beginning with or within the taxable year.  The amount of excess contributions includible in the gross income of the  employee, and the amount of excess contributions reported by the payer  or plan administrator as includible in the gross income of the employee,  does not include the amount of any reduction under Sec. 1.402(g)- 1(e)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Forfeiture of match on distributed excess contributions. A  matching contribution is taken into account under section 401(a)(4) even  if the match is with respect to an elective contribution that is  distributed or recharacterized under this paragraph (b). This requires  that, after correction of excess contributions, each level of matching  contributions be currently and effectively available to a group of  employees that satisfies section 410(b). See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 4(e)(3)(iii)(G). Thus, a plan that provides the same rate of matching  contributions to all employees will not meet the requirements of section  401(a)(4) if elective contributions are distributed under this paragraph  (b) to HCEs to the extent needed to meet the requirements of section  401(k)(3), while matching contributions attributable to those elective  contributions remain allocated to the HCEs' accounts. Under section  411(a)(3)(G) and Sec. 1.411(a)-4(b)(7), a plan may forfeit matching  contributions attributable to excess contributions, excess aggregate  contributions or excess deferrals to avoid a violation of section  401(a)(4). See also Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(g)(3)(vii)(B) regarding the use  of additional allocations to the accounts of NHCEs for the purpose of  correcting a discriminatory rate of matching contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Permitted forfeiture of QMAC. Pursuant to section  401(k)(8)(E), a qualified matching contribution is not treated as  forfeitable under Sec. 1.401(k)-1(c) merely because under the plan it  is forfeited in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section or  Sec. 1.414(w)-1(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> No requirement for recalculation. If excess contributions are  distributed or recharacterized in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and  (3) of this section, the cash or deferred arrangement is   treated as meeting the nondiscrimination test of section 401(k)(3)  regardless of whether the ADP for the HCEs, if recalculated after the  distributions or recharacterizations, would satisfy section 401(k)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>- 1(b)(1)(iii), are not corrected in accordance with this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Failure to timely correct--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to correct within 2\1/2\  months after end of plan year. If a plan does not correct excess  contributions within 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year for  which the excess contributions are made, the employer will be liable for  a 10% excise tax on the amount of the excess contributions. See section  4979 and Sec. 54.4979-1 of this chapter. Qualified nonelective  contributions and qualified matching contributions properly taken into  account under paragraph (a)(6) of this section for a plan year may  enable a plan to avoid having excess contributions, even if the  contributions are made after the close of the 2\1/2\ month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to correct within 12 months after end of plan year. If  excess contributions are not corrected within 12 months after the close  of the plan year for which they were made, the cash or deferred  arrangement will fail to satisfy the requirements of section 401(k)(3)  for the plan year for which the excess contributions are made and all  subsequent plan years during which the excess contributions remain in  the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> applies to a distribution of excess contributions  for a plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2010 only where all the  eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs are covered employees under the  eligible automatic contribution arrangement (within the meaning of Sec.  1.414(w)-1(e)(3)) for the entire plan year (or for the portion of the  plan year that the eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs are eligible  employees).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Additional rules for prior year testing method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rules for  change in testing method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A plan is permitted to  change from the prior year testing method to the current year testing  method for any plan year. A plan is permitted to change from the current  year testing method to the prior year testing method only in situations  described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this  paragraph (c)(1), a plan that uses the safe harbor method described in  Sec. 1.401(k)-3 or a SIMPLE 401(k) plan is treated as using the current  year testing method for that plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The plan is not the result of the aggregation of two or more  plans, and the current year testing method was used under the plan for  each of the 5 plan years preceding the plan year of the change (or if  lesser, the number of plan years the plan has been in existence,  including years in which the plan was a portion of another plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The plan is the result of the aggregation of two or more plans,  and for each of the plans that are being aggregated (the aggregating  plans), the current year testing method was used for each of the 5 plan  years preceding the plan year of the change (or if lesser, the number of  plan years since that aggregating plan has been in existence, including  years in which the aggregating plan was a portion of another plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(i)</em> and Sec.  1.410(b)-2(f) occurs and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As a result of the transaction, the employer maintains both a  plan using the prior year testing method and a plan using the current  year testing method; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The change from the current year testing method to the prior  year testing method occurs within the transition period described in  section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculation of ADP under the prior year testing method for the  first plan year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plans that are not successor plans. If, for the  first plan year of any plan (other than a successor plan), the plan uses  the prior year testing method, the plan is permitted to use either that  first plan year as the applicable year for determining the ADP for  eligible NHCEs, or use 3% as the ADP for eligible NHCEs, for applying  the ADP test for that first plan year. A plan (other than a successor  plan) that uses the prior year testing method but has elected for its  first plan year to use that year as the applicable year is not treated  as changing its testing method in the second plan year and is not  subject to the limitations on double counting on QNECs under paragraph  (a)(6)(vi) of this section for the second plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> First plan year defined. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2),  the first plan year of any plan is the first year in which the plan  provides for elective contributions. Thus, the rules of this paragraph  (c)(2) do not apply to a plan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(b)) for a plan year if for such plan year the plan is aggregated under  Sec. 1.401(k)-1(b)(4) with any other plan that provided for elective  contributions in the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Successor plans. A plan is a successor plan if 50% or more of  the eligible employees for the first plan year were eligible employees  under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement maintained by the  employer in the prior year. If a plan that is a successor plan uses the  prior year testing method for its first plan year, the ADP for the group  of NHCEs for the applicable year must be determined under paragraph  (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> cannot use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The recharacterization method of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section to correct excess contributions for a plan year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> to take elective  contributions into account under the ACP test (rather than the ADP  test); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rules of paragraph (a)(6)(v) of this section to take  qualified matching contributions into account under the ADP test (rather  than the ACP test).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules for plan coverage changes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A plan that  uses the prior year testing method and experiences a plan coverage  change during a plan year satisfies the requirements of this section for  that year only if the plan provides that the ADP for the NHCEs for the  plan year is the weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year  subgroups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Optional rule for minor plan coverage changes. If a plan  coverage change occurs and 90% or more of the total number of the NHCEs  from all prior year subgroups are from a single prior year subgroup,  then, in lieu of using the weighted averages described in paragraph  (c)(4)(i) of this section, the plan may provide that the ADP for the  group of eligible NHCEs for the prior year under the plan is the ADP of  the NHCEs for the prior year of the plan under which that single prior  year subgroup was eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this paragraph (c)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Plan coverage change. The term plan coverage change means a  change in the group or groups of eligible employees under a plan on  account of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The establishment or amendment of a plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A plan merger or spinoff under section 414(l);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A change in the way plans (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(b)) are combined or separated for purposes of Sec. 1.401(k)-1(b)(4)  (e.g., permissively aggregating plans not previously aggregated under  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d), or ceasing to permissively aggregate plans under  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A reclassification of a substantial group of employees that has  the same effect as amending the plan (e.g., a transfer of a substantial  group of employees from one division to another division); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A combination of any of paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A)(1) through (4)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prior year subgroup. The term prior year subgroup means all  NHCEs for the prior plan year who, in the prior year, were eligible  employees under a specific plan maintained by the employer that included  a qualified cash or deferred arrangement and who would have been  eligible employees in the prior year under the plan being tested if the  plan coverage change had first been effective as of the first day of the  prior plan year instead of first being effective during the plan year.  The determination of whether an NHCE is a member of a prior year  subgroup is made without regard to whether the NHCE terminated  employment during the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups. The  term weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups means the  sum, for all prior year subgroups, of the adjusted ADPs for the plan  year. The term adjusted ADP with respect to a prior year subgroup means  the ADP for the prior plan year of the specific plan under which the  members of the prior year subgroup were eligible employees on the first  day of the prior plan year, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the number of NHCEs in the prior year subgroup and denominator  of which is the total number of NHCEs in all prior year subgroups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer B maintains two calendar year plans, Plan O  and Plan P, each of which includes a cash or deferred arrangement. The  plans were not permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for the  2005 plan year. Both plans use the prior year testing method. Plan O had  300 eligible employees who were NHCEs for the 2005 plan year, and their  ADP for that year was 6%. Sixty of the eligible employees who were NHCEs  for the 2005 plan year under Plan O, terminated their employment during  that year. Plan P had 100 eligible employees who were NHCEs for 2005,  and the ADP for those NHCEs for that plan was 4%. Plan O and Plan P are  permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for the 2006 plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The permissive aggregation of Plan O and Plan P for the 2006  plan year under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) is a plan coverage change that  results in treating the plans as one plan (Plan OP) for purposes of  Sec. 1.401(k)-1(b)(4). Therefore, the prior year ADP for the NHCEs  under Plan OP for the 2006 plan year is the weighted average of the ADPs  for the prior year subgroups: the Plan O prior year subgroup and the  Plan P prior year subgroup.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Plan O prior year subgroup consists of the 300 employees  who, in the 2005 plan year, were eligible NHCEs under Plan O and who  would have been eligible under Plan OP for the 2005 plan year if Plan O  and Plan P had been permissively aggregated for that plan year. The Plan  P prior year subgroup consists of the 100 employees who, in the 2005  plan year, were eligible NHCEs under Plan P and would have been eligible  under Plan OP for the 2005 plan year if Plan O and Plan P had been  permissively aggregated for that plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups  is the sum of the adjusted ADP for the Plan O prior year subgroup and  the adjusted ADP for the Plan P prior year subgroup. The adjusted ADP  for the Plan O prior year subgroup is 4.5%, calculated as follows: 6%  (the ADP for the NHCEs under Plan O for the 2005 plan year) x 300/400  (the number of NHCEs in the Plan O prior year subgroup divided by the  total number of NHCEs in all prior year subgroups). The adjusted ADP for  the Plan P prior year subgroup is 1%, calculated as follows: 4% (the ADP  for the NHCEs under Plan P for the 2005 plan year) x 100/400 (the number  of NHCEs in the Plan P prior year subgroup divided by the total number  of NHCEs in all prior year subgroups). Thus, the prior year ADP for  NHCEs under Plan OP for the 2006 plan year is 5.5% (the sum of adjusted  ADPs for the prior year subgroups, 4.5% plus 1%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> As provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, the  determination of whether an NHCE is a member of a prior year subgroup is  made without regard to whether that NHCE terminated employment during  the prior year. Thus, the prior ADP for the NHCEs under Plan OP for the  2006 plan year is unaffected by the termination of the 60 NHCEs covered  by Plan O during the 2005 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as Example 1, except that the  60 employees who terminated employment during the 2005 plan are instead  spun-off to another plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The permissive aggregation of Plan O and Plan P for the 2006  plan year under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) is a plan coverage change that  results in treating the plans as one plan (Plan OP) for purposes of  Sec. 1.401(k)-1(b)(4) and the spin-off of the 60 employees is a plan  coverage change. Therefore, the prior year ADP for the NHCEs under Plan  OP for the 2006 plan year is the weighted average of the ADPs for the  prior year subgroups: the Plan O prior year subgroup and the Plan P  prior year subgroup.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining the prior year subgroups, the  employees who would have been eligible employees in the prior year under  the plan being tested are determined as if both plan coverage changes  had first been effective as of the first day of the prior plan year. The  Plan O prior year subgroup consists of the 240 employees who, in the  2005 plan year, were eligible NHCEs under Plan O and would have been  eligible under Plan OP for the 2005 plan year if the spin-off had  occurred at the beginning of the 2005 plan year and Plan O and Plan P  had been permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for that plan  year. The Plan P prior year subgroup consists of the 100 employees who,  in the 2005 plan year, were eligible NHCEs under Plan P and would have  been eligible under Plan OP for the 2005 plan year if Plan O and Plan P  had been permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for that plan  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups  is the sum of the adjusted ADP with respect to the prior year subgroup  consisting of eligible NHCEs from Plan O and the adjusted ADP with  respect to the prior year subgroup consisting of eligible NHCEs from  Plan P. The adjusted ADP for the prior year subgroup consisting of  eligible NHCEs under Plan O is 4.23%, calculated as follows: 6% (the ADP  for the NHCEs under Plan O for the 2005 plan year) x 240/340 (the number  of NHCEs in that prior year subgroup divided by the total number of  NHCEs in all prior year subgroups). The adjusted ADP for the prior year  subgroup consisting of the eligible NHCEs from Plan P is 1.18%,  calculated as follows: 4% (the ADP for the NHCEs under Plan P for the  2005 plan year) x 100/340 (the number of NHCEs in that prior year  subgroup divided by the total number of NHCEs in all prior year  subgroups). Thus, the prior year ADP for NHCEs under Plan OP for the  2006 plan year is 5.41% (the sum of adjusted ADPs for the prior year  subgroups, 4.23% plus 1.18%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  instead of Plan O and Plan P being permissively aggregated for the 2006  plan year, 200 of the employees eligible under Plan O were spun-off from  Plan O and merged into Plan P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The spin-off from Plan O and merger to Plan P for the 2006 plan  year are plan coverage changes for Plan P. Therefore, the prior year ADP  for the NHCEs under Plan P for the 2006 plan year is the weighted  average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups under Plan P. There are  2 subgroups under Plan P for the 2006 plan year. The Plan O prior year  subgroup consists of the 200 employees who, in the 2005 plan year, were  eligible NHCEs under Plan O and who would have been eligible under Plan  P for the 2005 plan year if the spin-off and merger had occurred on the  first day of the 2005 plan year. The Plan P prior year subgroup consists  of the 100 employees who, in the 2005 plan year, were eligible NHCEs  under Plan P for the 2005 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups  is the sum of the adjusted ADP for the Plan O prior year subgroup and  the adjusted ADP for the Plan P prior year subgroup. The adjusted ADP  for the Plan O prior year subgroup is 4.0%, calculated as follows: 6%  (the ADP for the NHCEs under Plan O for the 2005 plan year) x 200/300  (the number of NHCEs in the Plan O prior year subgroup divided by the  total number of NHCEs in all prior year subgroups). The adjusted ADP for  the Plan P prior year subgroup is 1.33%, calculated as follows: 4% (the  ADP for the NHCEs under Plan P for the 2005 plan year) x 100/300 (the  number of NHCEs in the Plan P prior year subgroup divided by the total  number of NHCEs in all prior year subgroups). Thus, the prior year ADP  for NHCEs under Plan P for the 2006 plan year is 5.33% (the sum of  adjusted ADPs for the 2 prior year subgroups, 4.0% plus 1.33%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The spin-off from Plan O for the 2006 plan year is a plan  coverage change for Plan O. Therefore, the prior year ADP for the NHCEs  under Plan O for the 2006 plan year is the weighted average of the ADPs  for the prior year subgroups under Plan O. In this case, there is only  one prior year subgroup under Plan O, the employees who were NHCEs of  Employer B for the 2005 plan year and who were eligible for the 2005  plan year under Plan O. Because there is only one prior year subgroup  under Plan O, the weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year  subgroup under Plan O is equal to the NHCE ADP for the prior year (2005  plan year) under Plan O, or 6%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer C maintains a calendar year plan, Plan Q,  which includes a cash or deferred arrangement that uses the prior year  testing method. Plan Q covers employees of Division A and Division B. In  2005, Plan Q had 500 eligible employees who were NHCEs, and the ADP for  those NHCEs for 2005 was 2%. Effective January 1, 2006, Employer C  amends the eligibility provisions   under Plan Q to exclude employees of Division B effective January 1,  2006. In addition, effective on that same date, Employer C establishes a  new calendar year plan, Plan R, which includes a cash or deferred  arrangement that uses the prior year testing method. The only eligible  employees under Plan R are the 100 employees of Division B who were  eligible employees under Plan Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan R is a successor plan, within the meaning of paragraph  (c)(2)(iii) of this section (because all of the employees were eligible  employees under Plan Q in the prior year). Therefore, Plan R cannot use  the first plan year rule set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> of this section for Plan Q and Plan R.  Accordingly, each plan must determine the NHCE ADP for the 2006 plan  year under the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The prior year ADP for NHCEs under Plan Q is the weighted  average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups. Plan Q has only one  prior year subgroup (because the only NHCEs who would have been eligible  employees under Plan Q for the 2005 plan year if the amendment to the  Plan Q eligibility provisions had occurred as of the first day of that  plan year were eligible employees under Plan Q). Therefore, for purposes  of the 2006 plan year under Plan Q, the ADP for NHCEs for the prior year  is the weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups, or 2%,  the same as if the plan amendment had not occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Similarly, Plan R has only one prior year subgroup (because the  only NHCEs who would have been eligible employees under Plan R for the  2005 plan year if the plan were established as of the first day of that  plan year were eligible employees under Plan Q). Therefore, for purposes  of the 2006 testing year under Plan R, the ADP for NHCEs for the prior  year is the weighted average of the ADPs for the prior year subgroups,  or 2%, the same as that of Plan Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that  the provisions of Plan R extend eligibility to 50 hourly employees who  previously were not eligible employees under any qualified cash or  deferred arrangement maintained by Employer C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan R is a successor plan (because 100 of Plan R's 150  eligible employees were eligible employees under another qualified cash  or deferred arrangement maintained by Employer C in the prior year).  Therefore, Plan R cannot use the first plan year rule set forth in  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The establishment of Plan R is a plan coverage change that  affects Plan R. Because the 50 hourly employees were not eligible  employees under any qualified cash or deferred arrangement of Employer C  for the prior plan year, they do not comprise a prior year subgroup.  Accordingly, Plan R still has only one prior year subgroup. Therefore,  for purposes of the 2006 testing year under Plan R, the ADP for NHCEs  for the prior year is the weighted average of the ADPs for the prior  year subgroups, or 2%, the same as that of Plan Q.

The safe harbor matching contribution requirement of this  paragraph (c) will not fail to be satisfied merely because safe harbor  matching contributions are made on both elective contributions and  employee contributions if safe harbor matching contributions are made  with respect to the sum of elective contributions and employee  contributions on the same terms as safe harbor matching contributions  are made with respect to elective contributions. Alternatively, the safe  harbor matching contribution requirement of this paragraph (c) will not  fail to be satisfied merely because safe harbor matching   contributions are made on both elective contributions and employee  contributions if safe harbor matching contributions on elective  contributions are not affected by the amount of employee contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Periodic matching contributions. The safe harbor matching  contribution requirement of this paragraph (c) will not fail to be  satisfied merely because the plan provides that safe harbor matching  contributions will be made separately with respect to each payroll  period (or with respect to all payroll periods ending with or within  each month or quarter of a plan year) taken into account under the plan  for the plan year, provided that safe harbor matching contributions with  respect to any elective contributions made during a plan year quarter  are contributed to the plan by the last day of the immediately following  plan year quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Permissible restrictions on elective contributions by NHCEs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. The safe harbor matching contribution requirement of this  paragraph (c) is not satisfied if elective contributions by NHCEs are  restricted, unless the restrictions are permitted by this paragraph  (c)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, a 30-day period is deemed to be a  reasonable period to make or change a cash or deferred election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restrictions on amount of elective contributions. A plan is  permitted to limit the amount of elective contributions that may be made  by an eligible employee under a plan, provided that each NHCE who is an  eligible employee is permitted (unless the employee is restricted under  paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section) to make elective contributions in  an amount that is at least sufficient to receive the maximum amount of  matching contributions available under the plan for the plan year, and  the employee is permitted to elect any lesser amount of elective  contributions. However, a plan may require eligible employees to make  cash or deferred elections in whole percentages of compensation or whole  dollar amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Restrictions on types of compensation that may be deferred. A  plan may limit the types of compensation that may be deferred by an  eligible employee under a plan, provided that each eligible NHCE is  permitted to make elective contributions under a definition of  compensation that would be a reasonable definition of compensation  within the meaning of Sec. 1.414(s)-1(d)(2). Thus, the definition of  compensation from which elective contributions may be made is not  required to satisfy the nondiscrimination requirement of Sec. 1.414(s)- 1(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Restrictions due to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.

The following examples illustrate the safe harbor  contribution requirement of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Beginning January 1, 2006, Employer A maintains Plan  L covering employees in Divisions D and E, each of which includes HCEs  and NHCEs. Plan L contains a cash or deferred arrangement and provides  qualified matching contributions equal to 100% of each eligible  employee's elective contributions up to 3% of compensation and 50% of  the next 2% of compensation. For purposes of the matching contribution  formula, safe harbor compensation is defined as all compensation within  the meaning of section 415(c)(3) (a definition that satisfies section  414(s)). Also, each employee is permitted to make elective contributions  from all safe harbor compensation within the meaning of section  415(c)(3) and may change a cash or deferred election at any time. Plan L  limits the amount of an employee's elective contributions for purposes  of section 402(g) and section 415, and, in the case of a hardship  distribution, suspends an employee's ability to make elective  contributions for 6 months in accordance with Sec. 1.401(k)- 1(d)(3)(iv)(E). All   contributions under Plan L are nonforfeitable and are subject to the  withdrawal restrictions of section 401(k)(2)(B). Plan L provides for no  other contributions and Employer A maintains no other plans. Plan L is  maintained on a calendar-year basis, and all contributions for a plan  year are made within 12 months after the end of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on these facts, matching contributions under Plan L are  safe harbor matching contributions because they are qualified matching  contributions equal to the basic matching formula. Accordingly, Plan L  satisfies the safe harbor contribution requirement of this paragraph  (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  instead of providing a basic matching contribution, Plan L provides a  qualified matching contribution equal to 100% of each eligible  employee's elective contributions up to 4% of safe harbor compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Plan L's formula is an enhanced matching formula because each  eligible NHCE receives safe harbor matching contributions at a rate  that, at any rate of elective contributions, provides an aggregate  amount of qualified matching contributions at least equal to the  aggregate amount of qualified matching contributions that would have  been received under the basic safe harbor matching formula, and the rate  of matching contributions does not increase as the rate of an employee's  elective contributions increases. Accordingly, Plan L satisfies the safe  harbor contribution requirement of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that  instead of permitting each employee to make elective contributions from  all compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3), each  employee's elective contributions under Plan L are limited to 15% of the  employee's basic compensation. Basic compensation is defined under Plan  L as compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3), but excluding  overtime pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The definition of basic compensation under Plan L is a  reasonable definition of compensation within the meaning of Sec.  1.414(s)-1(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Plan L will not fail to satisfy the safe harbor contribution  requirement of this paragraph (c) merely because Plan L limits the  amount of elective contributions and the types of compensation that may  be deferred by eligible employees, provided that each eligible NHCE may  make elective contributions equal to at least 4% of the employee's safe  harbor compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Plan L provides that only employees employed on the last day of the plan  year will receive a safe harbor matching contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Even if the plan that provides for employee contributions and  matching contributions satisfies the minimum coverage requirements of  section 410(b)(1) taking into account this last-day requirement, Plan L  would not satisfy the safe harbor contribution requirement of this  paragraph (c) because safe harbor matching contributions are not made on  behalf of all eligible NHCEs who make elective contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The result would be the same if, instead of providing safe  harbor matching contributions, Plan L provides for a 3% safe harbor  nonelective contribution that is restricted to eligible employees under  the cash or deferred arrangement who are employed on the last day of the  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  instead of providing qualified matching contributions under the basic  matching formula to employees in both Divisions D and E, employees in  Division E are provided qualified matching contributions under the basic  matching formula, while safe harbor matching contributions continue to  be provided to employees in Division D under the enhanced matching  formula described in Example 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Even if Plan L satisfies Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4 with respect to  each rate of matching contributions available to employees under the  plan, the plan would fail to satisfy the safe harbor contribution  requirement of this paragraph (c) because the rate of matching  contributions with respect to HCEs in Division D at a rate of elective  contributions between 3% and 5% would be greater than that with respect  to NHCEs in Division E at the same rate of elective contributions. For  example, an HCE in Division D who would have a 4% rate of elective  contributions would have a rate of matching contributions of 100% while  an NHCE in Division E who would have the same rate of elective  contributions would have a lower rate of matching contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notice requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The notice requirement of  this paragraph (d) is satisfied for a plan year if each eligible  employee is given notice of the employee's rights and obligations under  the plan and the notice satisfies the content requirement of paragraph  (d)(2) of this section and the timing requirement of paragraph (d)(3) of  this section. The notice must be in writing or in such other form as may  be approved by the Commissioner. See Sec. 1.401(a)-21 of this chapter  for rules permitting the use of electronic media to provide applicable  notices to recipients with respect to retirement plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Content requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The content requirement  of this   paragraph (d)(2) is satisfied if the notice is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to inform the employee  of the employee's rights and obligations under the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average  employee eligible to participate in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum content requirement. Subject to the requirements of  paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, a notice is not considered  sufficiently accurate and comprehensive unless the notice accurately  describes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The safe harbor matching contribution or safe harbor nonelective  contribution formula used under the plan (including a description of the  levels of safe harbor matching contributions, if any, available under  the plan);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any other contributions under the plan or matching contributions  to another plan on account of elective contributions or employee  contributions under the plan (including the potential for discretionary  matching contributions) and the conditions under which such  contributions are made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The plan to which safe harbor contributions will be made (if  different than the plan containing the cash or deferred arrangement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The type and amount of compensation that may be deferred under  the plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> How to make cash or deferred elections, including any  administrative requirements that apply to such elections;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The periods available under the plan for making cash or deferred  elections;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Withdrawal and vesting provisions applicable to contributions  under the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Information that makes it easy to obtain additional information  about the plan (including an additional copy of the summary plan  description) such as telephone numbers, addresses and, if applicable,  electronic addresses, of individuals or offices from whom employees can  obtain such plan information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> References to SPD. A plan will not fail to satisfy the content  requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) merely because, in the case of  information described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section  (relating to any other contributions under the plan), paragraph  (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section (relating to the plan to which safe harbor  contributions will be made) or paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(D) of this section  (relating to the type and amount of compensation that may be deferred  under the plan), the notice cross-references the relevant portions of a  summary plan description that provides the same information that would  be provided in accordance with such paragraphs and that has been  provided (or is concurrently provided) to employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The timing requirement of  this paragraph (d)(3) is satisfied if the notice is provided within a  reasonable period before the beginning of the plan year (or, in the year  an employee becomes eligible, within a reasonable period before the  employee becomes eligible). The determination of whether a notice  satisfies the timing requirement of this paragraph (d)(3) is based on  all of the relevant facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deemed satisfaction of timing requirement. The timing  requirement of this paragraph (d)(3) is deemed to be satisfied if at  least 30 days (and no more than 90 days) before the beginning of each  plan year, the notice is given to each eligible employee for the plan  year. In the case of an employee who does not receive the notice within  the period described in the previous sentence because the employee  becomes eligible after the 90th day before the beginning of the plan  year, the timing requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the notice is  provided no more than 90 days before the employee becomes eligible (and  no later than the date the employee becomes eligible). Thus, for  example, the preceding sentence would apply in the case of any employee  eligible for the first plan year under a newly established plan that  provides for elective contributions, or would apply in the case of the  first plan year in which an employee becomes eligible under an existing  plan that provides for elective contributions. If it is not practicable  for the notice to be provided on or before the date specified in the  plan that an employee becomes eligible, the notice will   nonetheless be treated as provided timely if it is provided as soon as  practicable after that date and the employee is permitted to elect to  defer from all types of compensation that may be deferred under the plan  earned beginning on the date the employee becomes eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Plan year requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in  this paragraph (e) or in paragraph (f) of this section, a plan will fail  to satisfy the requirements of sections 401(k)(12), 401(k)(13), and this  section unless plan provisions that satisfy the rules of this section  are adopted before the first day of the plan year and remain in effect  for an entire 12-month plan year. In addition, except as provided in  paragraph (g) of this section or in guidance of general applicability  published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter), a plan which includes provisions  that satisfy the rules of this section will not satisfy the requirements  of Sec. 1.401(k)-1(b) if it is amended to change such provisions for  that plan year. Moreover, if, as described under paragraph (h)(4) of  this section, safe harbor matching or nonelective contributions will be  made to another plan for a plan year, provisions under that other plan  specifying that the safe harbor contributions will be made and providing  that the contributions will be QNECs or QMACs must also be adopted  before the first day of that plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii))</em> will  not be treated as violating the requirements of this paragraph (e)  merely because the plan year is less than 12 months, provided that the  plan year is at least 3 months long (or, in the case of a newly  established employer that establishes the plan as soon as  administratively feasible after the employer comes into existence, a  shorter period). Similarly, a cash or deferred arrangement will not fail  to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (e) if it is added to an  existing profit sharing, stock bonus, or pre-ERISA money purchase  pension plan for the first time during that year provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan is not a successor plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cash or deferred arrangement is made effective no later  than 3 months prior to the end of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Change of plan year. A plan that has a short plan year as a  result of changing its plan year will not fail to satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section merely because the plan  year has less than 12 months, provided that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan satisfied the requirements of this section for the  immediately preceding plan year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The plan satisfies the requirements of this section (determined  without regard to paragraph (g) of this section) for the immediately  following plan year (or for the immediately following 12 months if the  immediately following plan year is less than 12 months).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Final plan year. A plan that terminates during a plan year will  not fail to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section  merely because the final plan year is less than 12 months, provided that  the plan satisfies the requirement of this section through the date of  termination and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(D)</em> or (g)(1)(ii)(D) of  this section (requiring that employees have a reasonable opportunity to  change their cash or deferred elections and, if applicable, employee  contribution elections); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The plan termination is in connection with a transaction  described in section 410(b)(6)(C) or the employer incurs a substantial  business hardship comparable to a substantial business hardship  described in section 412(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> for a plan year  may provide for the use of the safe harbor method described in this  section solely for that plan year and a plan sponsor is not limited in  the number of years for which it is permitted to adopt an amendment  providing for the safe harbor method of this section using nonelective  contributions under paragraph (b) of this section and this paragraph  (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(A)</em> of this section, the notice specifies that the plan may be  amended during the plan year to include the safe harbor nonelective  contribution and that, if the plan is amended, a follow-up notice will  be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> if, no later  than 30 days before the last day of the plan year, each eligible  employee is given a notice that states that the safe harbor nonelective  contributions will be made for the plan year.

Similarly, an  elective contribution that would be taken into account for a plan year  under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(4)(i)(B)(2) must be taken into account for  such plan year for purposes of this section, even if the compensation  would have been received after the close of the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em>.

Consequently, the plan to which the contributions  are made must have the same plan year as the plan containing the cash  and deferred arrangement and each employee eligible under the plan  containing the cash or deferred arrangement must be eligible under the  same conditions under the other defined contribution plan.

A plan may, however, limit the period taken into  account under either method to that portion of the plan year or calendar  year in which the employee was an eligible employee, provided that this  limit is applied uniformly to all eligible employees under the plan for  the plan year.

See Sec.  1.401(k)-1(e)(5), however, for certain limits on the use of minimum  service requirements. An employee who would be eligible to make elective  contributions but for a suspension due to a distribution, a loan, or an  election not to participate in the plan, is treated as an eligible  employee for purposes of section 401(k)(3) for a plan year even though  the employee may not make a cash or deferred election by reason of the  suspension.

Qualified nonelective  contributions or QNECs means employer contributions, other than elective  contributions or matching contributions, that, except as provided  otherwise in Sec. 1.401(k)-1(c) and (d), satisfy the requirements of  Sec. 1.401(k)-1(c) and (d) as though the contributions were elective  contributions, without regard to whether the contributions are actually  taken into account under the ADP test under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(6) or  the ACP test under Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(6).

Section 401(a)(4) provides  that a plan is a qualified plan only if the amount of contributions or  benefits provided under the plan does not discriminate in favor of  highly compensated employees. See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2). Section  401(a)(5)(C) provides that a plan does not discriminate in favor of  highly compensated employees merely because of disparities in employer- provided contributions or benefits provided to, or on behalf of,  employees under the plan that are permitted under section 401(l). Thus,  if a plan satisfies section 401(l), permitted disparities in employer- provided contributions or benefits under a plan are disregarded, by  reason of section 401(a)(5)(C), in determining whether the plan  satisfies any of the safe harbors under Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(b)(2)  and 1.401(a)(4)-3(b). However, even if disparities in employer-provided  contributions or benefits under a plan are permitted under section  401(l) and thus do not cause the plan to fail to satisfy Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-1(b)(2), the plan may still fail to satisfy section  401(a)(4) for other reasons. Similarly, even if disparities in employer- provided contributions or benefits under a plan are not permitted under  section 401(l) and thus may not be disregarded under section 401(a)(4)  by reason of section 401(l), the plan may still be found to be  nondiscriminatory under the tests of section 401(a)(4), including the  rules for imputing permitted disparity under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overview. Rules relating to disparities in employer-provided  contributions under a defined contribution plan are provided in Sec.  1.401(l)-2. For rules relating to disparities in employer-provided  benefits under a defined benefit plan, see Sec. 401(l)-3. For rules  relating to the application of section 401(l) to a plan maintained by a  railroad employer, see Sec. 1.401(l)-4. For rules relating to the  overall permitted disparity limits, see Sec. 1.401(l)-5. For rules  relating to the effective date of section 401(l), see Sec. 1.401(l)-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exclusive rules. The rules provided in Sec. Sec. 1.401(l)-1  through 1.401(l)-6 are the exclusive means for a plan to satisfy  sections 401(l) and 401(a)(5)(C). Accordingly, a plan that provides  disparities in employer-provided contributions or benefits that are not  permitted under Sec. Sec. 1.401(l)-1 through 1.401(l)-6 does not  satisfy section 401(l) or 401(a)(5)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions.

For this  purpose, a plan maintained for a self-   employed individual within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), who is also  subject to the tax under section 1401, is deemed to be a plan maintained  by an employer that pays wages within the meaning of section 3121(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this chapter, which  contains a limited exception to this rule for certain ESOPs in existence  on November 1, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to elective contributions as defined in Sec.  1.401(k)-6 under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement as defined in  Sec. 1.401(k)-1(a)(4)(i) or with respect to employee or matching  contributions defined in Sec. 1.401(m)-1(a)(3) or (a)(2), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to contributions to a simplified employee pension  made under a salary reduction arrangement described in section 408(k)(6)  (a SARSEP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional rules. The Commissioner may, in revenue rulings,  notices, or other documents of general applicability, prescribe  additional rules that may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the  purposes of section 401(l), including rules applying section 401(l) with  respect to an employer that pays wages within the meaning of section  3121(a) or compensation within the meaning of section 3231(e) for some  years and not other years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)(G)</em>. However, a plan does not fail to satisfy section 401(l)  merely because, in order to ensure compliance with section 411, an  employee's accrued benefit under the plan is defined as the greater of  the employee's previously accrued benefit and the benefit determined  under a strict application of the plan's benefit formula and accrual  method. See section 401(a)(15) for additional rules relating to  circumstances under which plan benefits may not be decreased because of  increases in social security benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> govern unless otherwise  provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accumulation plan.

For purposes of determining  the amount of an employee's covered compensation under paragraph  (c)(7)(i) of this section, a plan may use tables, provided by the  Commissioner, that are developed by rounding the actual amounts of  covered compensation for different years of birth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Proposed regulation definition. For plan years beginning before  January 1, 1995, in lieu of the definition of covered compensation  contained in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, a plan may define  covered compensation as the average (without indexing) of the taxable  wage bases in effect for each calendar year during the 35-year period  ending with the last day of the calendar year preceding the calendar  year in which the employee attains (or will attain) social security  retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Period for using covered compensation amount. A plan must  generally provide that an employee's covered compensation is  automatically adjusted for each plan year. However, a plan may use an  amount of covered compensation for employees equal to each employee's  covered compensation (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) or (c)(7)(ii) of  this section) for a plan year earlier than the current plan year,  provided the earlier plan year is the same for all employees and is not  earlier than the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The plan year that begins 5 years before the current plan year,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The plan year beginning in 1989.

Defined benefit plan means a defined  benefit plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Defined contribution plan.

In the case of an optional form of benefit that is  not described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, the optional  form must satisfy the maximum permitted disparity requirement of this  paragraph (b), when the respective portions of the optional form are  normalized under the rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12 to a straight life  annuity commencing at the same time as the optional form of benefit,  regardless of whether the straight life annuity form is actually  provided under the plan. In the case of a defined benefit excess plan,  the respective portions are the portion of the optional form  attributable to average annual compensation up to the integration level  (the ``base portion'') and the portion of the optional form attributable  to average annual compensation in excess of the integration level (the  ``excess portion'').

In the case of a  defined benefit excess plan, the plan uses each employee's covered  compensation as the integration level; in the case of an offset plan,  the plan uses each employee's covered compensation as the offset level  and provides that an employee's final average compensation is limited to  the employee's average annual compensation. Each example discusses the  benefit formula applicable to an employee who has a social security  retirement age of 65.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan N is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 0.5 percent of average annual compensation  in excess of the integration level, for each year of service. The plan  provides no benefits with respect to average annual compensation up to  the integration level. The disparity provided under the plan exceeds the  maximum excess allowance because the excess benefit percentage (0.5  percent) exceeds the base benefit percentage (0 percent) by more than  the base benefit percentage (0 percent).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan O is an offset plan that provides a normal  retirement benefit equal to 2 percent of average annual compensation,  minus 0.75 percent of final average compensation up to the offset level,  for each year of service up to 35.

Plan P is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 0.5 percent of average annual compensation  up to the integration level, plus 1.25 percent of average annual  compensation in excess of the integration level, for each year of  service up to 35.

The plan determines an employee's average  annual compensation using an averaging period comprising five  consecutive 12-month periods and taking into account the employee's  compensation for the ten consecutive 12-month periods ending with the  plan year. The plan does not provide that an employee's final average  compensation is limited to the employee's average annual compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)</em> of this section is one-half of the gross benefit  percentage multiplied by the ratio, not to exceed one, of Employee A's  average annual compensation to Employee A's final average compensation  up to the offset level. Thus, the maximum offset allowance is 0.4  percent (\1/2\x1 percentx$20,000/$25,000). With respect to Employee A,  the benefit formula provides an offset that exceeds the maximum offset  allowance. The plan must therefore reduce Employee A's offset percentage  to 0.4 percent. (Under paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section, Employee  A's adjusted disparity rate is deemed uniform.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(17)(ii)</em> (the definition  of final average compensation), the plan could specify that an  employee's final average compensation is limited to the amount of the  employee's average annual compensation. Thus, the ratio of average  annual compensation to final average compensation would always be equal  to at least one, and the maximum offset allowance under the plan would  be one-half of the gross benefit percentage.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Plan S is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  base benefit percentage of 1 percent of average annual compensation up  to the integration level for each year of service. The plan also  provides, for each of the first 10 years of service, an excess benefit  percentage of 1.85 percent of average annual compensation in excess of  the integration level. For each year of service after 10, the plan  provides an excess benefit percentage of 1.65 percent of the employee's  average annual compensation in excess of the integration level. The  disparity provided under the plan exceeds the maximum excess allowance  because the excess benefit percentage for each of the first ten years of  service (1.85 percent) exceeds the base benefit percentage (1 percent)  by more than 0.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that the  plan provides an excess benefit percentage of 1.65 percent of average  annual compensation in excess of the integration level for each of the  first 10 years of service and an excess benefit percentage of 1.85  percent of average annual compensation in excess of the integration  level for each year of service after 10. The disparity provided under  the plan exceeds the maximum excess allowance because the excess benefit  percentage for each year of service after 10 (1.85 percent) exceeds the  base benefit percentage (1 percent) by more than 0.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Plan T is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 1.0 percent of average annual compensation  up to the integration level, plus 1.7 percent of average annual  compensation in excess of the integration level, for each year of  service up to 35, payable in the form of a joint and survivor annuity.  The plan also allows an employee to receive the retirement benefit in  the form of an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity. The  actuarially equivalent straight life annuity equals 1.09 percent of  average annual compensation up to the integration level, plus 1.85  percent of average annual compensation in excess of the integration  level, for each year of service up to 35. The disparity provided under  the plan with respect to the straight life annuity form of benefit (0.76  percent) exceeds the maximum excess allowance because the excess benefit  percentage (1.85 percent) exceeds the base benefit percentage (1.09  percent) by more than 0.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Plan U is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 1.0 percent of average annual compensation  up to the integration level, plus 1.7 percent of average annual  compensation in excess of the integration level, for each year of  service up to 35, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Plan U  provides a single sum optional form of benefit at normal retirement age  equal to 100 times the monthly annuity payable at that age. Thus, if an  employee elects the single sum optional form of benefit, the base  portion of the single sum benefit is 8.33 percent (100 times 1.0  percent/12) of average annual compensation up to the integration level  per year of service, and the excess portion of the single sum benefit is  14.17 percent (100 times 1.7 percent/12) of average annual compensation  in excess of the integration level per year of service. Each respective  portion of the single sum option is normalized to a straight life  annuity commencing at normal retirement age, using 8-percent interest  and the UP-84 mortality table. After normalization, the base portion of  the benefit is 1.02 percent of average annual compensation up to the  integration level, and the excess portion of the benefit is 1.73 percent  of average annual compensation in excess of the integration level. The  single sum optional form of benefit satisfies this paragraph (b) because  the disparity provided in the optional form of benefit does not exceed  the maximum excess allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Uniform disparity--(1) In general.

In the case of an offset plan, the plan provides  that the offset applied to each employee's benefit is the lesser of a  specified percentage of the employee's PIA and an offset that otherwise  satisfies the requirements of this section (the ``section 401(l)  overlay''). The specified percentage of PIA must be the same for all  employees with the same number of years of service. In the case of a  plan that determines each employee's accrued benefit under the  fractional accrual method of section 411(b)(1)(C), the specified  percentage of PIA is deemed to be the same for all employees with the  same number of years of service if the plan satisfies either of the  deemed uniformity rules in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this  section, substituting ``offset, expressed as a percentage of PIA, per  year of service'' for the term ``offset percentage'' (in addition to  satisfying either of those rules with respect to the section 401(l)  overlay).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section. In the case of a defined  benefit excess plan, the plan uses each employee's covered compensation  as the integration level; in the case of an offset plan, the plan uses  each employee's covered compensation as the offset level and provides  that an employee's final average compensation is limited to the  employee's average annual compensation. Each example discusses the  benefit formula applicable to an employee who has a social security  retirement age of 65.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan M is a defined benefit excess plan that satisfies  the 133\1/3\ percent accrual rule of section 411(b)(1)(B). The plan  provides a normal retirement benefit of 1.0 percent of average annual  compensation up to the integration level, plus 1.65 percent of average  annual compensation in excess of the integration level, for each year of  service up to 25. The plan also provides a benefit of 1.0 percent of all  average annual compensation for each year of service in excess of 25.  The disparity provided under the plan is uniform because the plan uses  the same base and excess benefit percentages for all employees with the  same number of years of service. If the plan formula were the same  except that it used a different excess benefit percentage for some of  the years of service between one and 25, the disparity under the plan  would continue to be uniform.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan O is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 50 percent of average annual compensation  up to the integration level and 68.75 percent of average annual  compensation in excess of the integration level, multiplied by a  fraction, the numerator of which is the employee's service, up to 25  years, and the denominator of which is 25. The plan determines an  employee's accrued benefit as described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 3(b)(4)(i)(B). The benefit formula thus provides a base benefit  percentage of 2 percent (50 percentx\1/25\) and an excess benefit  percentage of 2.75 percent (68.75 percentx\1/25\) for each of an  employee's first 25 years of service and no benefit for years of service  after 25. The disparity provided under the plan is not uniform within  the meaning of this paragraph (c) because the benefit formula does not  satisfy either of the uniform disparity rules for fractional accrual  plans under paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan P is an offset plan that provides a normal  retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation for each  year of service up to 35, minus 0.75 percent of the final average  compensation up to the offset level for each year of service up to 25.  The plan determines an employee's accrued benefit under the method  described in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-3(b)(4)(i)(B). Because the formula   under the plan provides the same gross benefit percentage and offset  percentage for 25 years of service (fewer than 35) and, for years of  service after 25 and up to 35, provides a benefit at a uniform rate  (equal to the gross benefit percentage) of all average annual  compensation, and the plan accrues the benefit ratably, the disparity  under the plan is deemed to be uniform under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Plan Q is an offset plan that benefits employees with  social security retirement ages of 65, 66, and 67. For each year of  service up to 35, the plan provides a normal retirement benefit equal to  2 percent of average annual compensation, minus an offset based on the  employee's final average compensation up to the offset level. For  employees with a social security retirement age of 65, the offset  percentage is 0.75 percent; for employees with a social security  retirement age of 66, the offset percentage is 0.70 percent; and for  employees with a social security retirement age of 67, the offset  percentage is 0.65 percent. The disparity under the plan is deemed to be  uniform under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section because the plan uses  the same gross benefit percentage for all employees and reduces the  offset percentage for employees with social security retirement ages of  66 and 67 to comply with the adjustments in the 0.75-percent factor in  the maximum excess or offset allowance required under paragraph (e)(1)  of this section. (Because Plan Q effectively provides unreduced benefits  prior to the social security retirement age for employees with social  security retirement ages of 66 and 67, the 0.75-percent factor in the  maximum offset allowance must be reduced to 0.70 percent and 0.65  percent, respectively.) Alternatively, Plan Q could satisfy this  paragraph (c) if it provided a uniform offset percentage of 0.65 percent  for all employees because 0.65 percent is the maximum offset allowance  under the plan for an employee with a social security retirement age of  67.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Plan R is an offset plan that provides a normal  retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation, minus an  offset determined as a percentage of total final average compensation,  for each year of service up to 35. For an employee whose final average  compensation does not exceed the employee's covered compensation, the  offset percentage is 0.75 percent. For an employee whose final average  compensation exceeds the employee's covered compensation, the plan  reduces the offset percentage, as required by paragraph (d) of this  section. The reduced offset percentage is determined by comparing the  employee's final average compensation to the employee's covered  compensation as permitted under paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(B) of this  section. The disparity provided under the plan is deemed uniform under  paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section because the plan uses the same gross  benefit percentage for all employees and makes individual reductions in  the 0.75-percent factor, as permitted under paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(B) of  this section, by reducing the offset percentage in the case of an  employee whose final average compensation exceeds covered compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for integration or offset level--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

If the integration  or offset level specified under the plan is each employee's covered  compensation as of the plan year, no reduction in the 0.75-percent  factor in the maximum excess or offset allowance is required for the  plan year under this paragraph (d)(9). If a plan specifies an  integration or offset level that exceeds an employee's covered  compensation, the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess or offset  allowance must be reduced as required in paragraph (d)(9)(ii) or (iii)  of this section.

Thus, for example, if a plan specifies an integration or offset level of  120 percent of each employee's covered compensation, the 0.75-percent  factor in the maximum excess or offset allowance must be reduced to 0.69  percent in accordance with the table because the specified integration  or offset level is more than covered compensation but not more than 125  percent of covered compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> (A) or (B) of this section, as specified under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  is determined by comparing the highest possible amount   of final average compensation to the covered compensation of an  individual attaining social security retirement age in the calendar year  in which the plan year begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Individual reductions.

The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d).  Unless otherwise provided, the following facts apply. The plan is  noncontributory and is the only plan ever maintained by the employer.  The plan uses a normal retirement age of 65 and contains no provision  that would require a reduction in the 0.75-percent factor under  paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. In the case of an offset  plan, the plan provides that an employee's final average compensation is  limited to the employee's average annual compensation. Each example  discusses the benefit formula applicable to an employee who has a social  security retirement age of 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan M is a defined benefit excess plan that uses the  calendar year as its plan year. For the 1989 plan year, the plan uses an  integration level of $20,000, which is 118 percent of the 1989 covered  compensation of $16,968 for an individual reaching social security  retirement age in 1989. The plan may use that integration level without  satisfying paragraph (d)(8) of this section, provided the adjustment to  the 0.75-percent factor required under paragraph (d)(6) of this section  is made. That adjustment is the lesser of the factor determined under  paragraph (d)(9) of this section or 80 percent of the factor otherwise  applicable under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The plan determines the factor under paragraph (d)(9) of this  section by comparing the integration level to the covered compensation  of an individual attaining social security retirement age in the  calendar year in which the plan year begins and by rounding the  integration level up to 125 percent of that covered compensation amount.  The 0.75-percent factor is therefore replaced by 0.69 percent pursuant  to the table in paragraph (d)(9) of this section. The 0.69-percent  factor is 92 percent of the 0.75-percent factor. Because the lesser of  80 percent and 92 percent is 80 percent, the 0.75-percent factor is  reduced to 0.6 percent (80 percent of 0.75 percent) under paragraph  (d)(6) of this section. The 0.6-percent factor applies to benefits  commencing at age 65 for an employee with a social security retirement  age of 65. In determining normal retirement benefits for employees with  social security retirement ages of 66 or 67, the applicable factors for  benefits commencing at age 65 are, respectively, 0.56 percent (80  percent of 0.7 percent) and 0.52 percent (80 percent of 0.65 percent).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The plan could also determine the factor under paragraph (d)(9)  of this section by comparing the integration level to the covered  compensation of each employee under the plan, or by straight line  interpolation between the disparity factors contained in the table in  paragraph (d)(9) of this section, or both.

An employee's   total retirement benefit is the sum of the accruals for all years. The  plan satisfies paragraph (d)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because the plan uses the taxable wage base (an amount above  covered compensation) as the integration level, it must reduce the 0.75- percent factor in the maximum excess allowance as required under  paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(9) of this section. The reduced factor, if  determined on a plan-wide basis under paragraph (d)(9)(iii)(A) of this  section, is 0.42 percent. The plan must therefore reduce the disparity  in the plan so that it does not exceed 0.42 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For the 1990 plan year, Plan O provides a normal  retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation, minus a  percentage of final average compensation up to $48,000, for each year of  service up to 35. The plan satisfies paragraph (d)(8) of this section.  As permitted under paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the plan provides  that each employee's offset percentage is determined by comparing  $48,000 to the employee's covered compensation and by rounding the  result up to the next highest percentage of covered compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(3)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The cumulative reductions can be made by multiplying the  paragraph (e) facdtor by the ratio of the paragraph (d) factor to 0.75  percent or by multiplying the paragraph (d) factor by the ratio of the  paragraph (e) factor to 0.75 percent. The disparity factor for Employee  A is therefore 0.64 percent ((0.7 percentx0.69 percent/0.75 percent) or  (0.69 percentx0.7 percent/0.75 percent)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Plan P is an offset plan that uses the calendar year as  the plan year and uses an offset level of each employee's final average  compensation. Assume that the taxable wage bases for 1990-1992 are the  following:  1990--$51,300 1991--$53.400 1992--$58,000   Employee B's final average compensation, determined as of the close of  the 1992 plan year, is the average of Employee B's annual compensation  for the period 1990-1992. Employee B's annual compensation for each year  is the following:  1990--$47,000 1991--$59,000 1992--$65,000  For purposes of determining the offset applied to Employee B's employer- provided benefit under the plan. Employee's B's final average  compensation as of the close of the 1992 plan year is $52,800 ($47,000 +  $53,400 + $58,000/3). This is because annual compensation in excess of  the taxable wage base in effect at the beginning of the year may not be  taken into account in determining an employee's final average  compensation or in determining the employee's offset. If the plan  determines the offset applied to Employee B's benefit by reference to  compensation in excess of $52,800, the plan fails to satisfy this  paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Adjustments to the 0.75-percent factor for benefits commencing  at ages other than social security retirement age--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess allowance and in the maximum  offset allowance applies to a benefit commencing at an employee's social  security retirement age. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this  section, if a benefit payable to an employee under a defined benefit  excess plan or a defined benefit offset plan commences at an age before  the employee's social security retirement age (including a benefit  payable at the normal retirement age under the plan), the 0.75-percent  factor in the maximum excess allowance or in the maximum offset  allowance, respectively, is reduced in accordance with paragraph  (e)(2)(i) of this section. If a benefit payable to an employee under a  defined benefit excess plan or a defined offset plan commences at an age  after the employee's social security retirement age, the 0.75-percent  factor in the maximum excess allowance or in the maximum offset  allowance, respectively, may be increased in accordance with paragraph  (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Paragraph (e)(4) of this section provides  rules on the age at which a benefit commences. See paragraph (f) of this  section for the requirements applicable to optional forms of benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Benefits commencing on or after age 55 and  before social security retirement age. If benefits commence before an  employee's social security retirement age, the 0.75-percent factor in  the maximum excess allowance and in the maximum offset allowance must be  reduced for such early   commencement of benefits in accordance with the tables set forth in  paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benefits commencing after social security retirement age and on  or before age 70. If benefits commence after an employee's social  security retirement age, the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess  allowance and in the maximum offset allowance may be increased for such  delayed commencement of benefits in accordance with the tables set forth  in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Benefits commencing before age 55. If benefits commence before  the employee attains age 55, the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum  excess allowance and in the maximum offset allowance is further reduced  (on a monthly basis to reflect the month in which benefits commence) to  a factor that is the actuarial equivalent of the 0.75-percent factor, as  adjusted under the tables in paragraph (e)(3) of this section,  applicable to a benefit commencing in the month in which the employee  attains age 55. In determining actuarial equivalence for this purpose, a  reasonable interest rate must be used. In addition, a reasonable  mortality table must be used to determine the actuarial present value,  as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12, of the benefits commencing at age 55  and at the earlier commencement age, and a reasonable mortality table  may be used to determine the actuarial present value at the earlier  commencement age of the benefits commencing at age 55. A standard  interest rate and a standard mortality table, as defined in Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-12, are considered reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Benefits commencing after age 70. If benefits commence after  the employee attains age 70, the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum  excess allowance and in the maximum offset allowance may be further  increased (on a monthly basis to reflect the month in which benefits  commence) to a factor that is the actuarial equivalent of the 0.75- percent factor (as adjusted in accordance with this paragraph (e))  applicable to a benefit commencing in the month in which the employee  attains age 70. In determining actuarial equivalence for this purpose, a  reasonable interest rate must be used. In addition, a reasonable  mortality table must be used to determine the actuarial present value,  as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12, of the benefits commencing at age 70  and at the later commencement age, and a reasonable mortality table may  be used to determine the value at the later commencement age of the  benefits commencing at age 70. A standard interest rate and a standard  mortality table, as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12, are considered  reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tables. Tables I, II, and III provide the adjustments in the  0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess allowance and in the maximum  offset allowance applicable to benefits commencing on or after age 55  and on or before age 70 to an employee who has a social security  retirement age of 65, 66 or 67. Table IV is a simplified table for a  plan that uses a single disparity factor of 0.65 percent for all  employees at age 65. The factors in the following tables are applicable  to benefits that commence in the month the employee attains the  specified age. Accordingly, if benefits commence in a month other than  the month in which the employee attains the specified age, appropriate  adjustments in the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess allowance  and the maximum offset allowance must be made.

The following examples illustrate this paragraph (e).  Unless otherwise provided, the following facts apply. The plan is  noncontributory and is the only plan ever maintained by the employer.  The plan uses a normal retirement age of 65 and contains no provision  that would require a reduction in the 0.75-percent factor under  paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. In the case of a defined  benefit excess plan, the plan uses each employee's covered compensation  as the integration level; in the case of an offset plan, the plan uses  each employee's covered compensation as the offset level and provides  that an employee's final average compensation is limited to the  employee's average annual compensation. Each example discusses the  benefit formula applicable to an employee who has a social security  retirement age of 65.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan M is a defined benefit excess plan that, for an  employee with a social security retirement age of 65, provides a normal  retirement benefit of 1.25 percent of average annual compensation up to  the integration level, plus 2.0 percent of average annual compensation  in excess of the integration level, for each year of service up to 35.  For an employee with at least 20 years of service, the plan provides a  benefit commencing at age 55 that is equal to the benefit payable at age  65. For that employee, the disparity provided under the plan at age 55  is   0.75 percent (2 percent-1.25 percent). Because this disparity exceeds  the 0.375 percent factor provided in the table for a benefit payable at  age 55 to an employee with a social security retirement age of 65, the  plan fails to satisfy paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section with  respect to the early retirement benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the  base benefit percentage under the plan is 1.75 percent. Thus, the  disparity provided under the plan at age 55 is 0.25 percent (2 percent- 1.75 percent). Because the disparity does not exceed the 0.375 percent  factor provided in the table for a benefit payable at age 55 to an  employee with a social security retirement age of 65, the plan does not  fail to satisfy paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section with respect to  the early retirement benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan N is an offset plan that, for an employee with a  social security retirement age of 65, provides a normal retirement  benefit of 1.75 percent of average annual compensation, minus 0.75  percent of final average compensation up to the offset level, for each  year of service up to 35. For an employee with at least 20 years of  service, the plan provides a benefit commencing at age 55 that is equal  to the benefit payable at age 65. For that employee, the disparity  provided under the plan at age 55 is 0.75 percent. Because this  disparity exceeds the 0.375-percent factor provided in the table for an  offset applied to a benefit payable at age 55 to an employee with a  social security retirement age of 65, the plan fails to satisfy  paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section with respect to the early  retirement benefit. The plan would not fail to satisfy paragraphs (b)  and (e) of this section with respect to the early retirement benefit if  the applicable factor for determining the offset applied to the benefit  were reduced to 0.375 percent.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Plan O is a defined benefit excess plan that, for an  employee with a social security retirement age of 65, provides a normal  retirement benefit of 1.25 percent of average annual compensation up to  the integration level, plus 2.0 percent of average annual compensation  in excess of the integration level, for each year of service up to 35.  The plan provides benefits commencing before normal retirement age with  the following reductions:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Percentage of normal</p><p class="depth0">Age                        retirement benefit (%) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 64........................................  90 63........................................  85 62........................................  80 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Under the plan, a benefit payable at age 64 is equal to 90 percent of  the normal retirement benefit payable at age 65. Thus, the excess  benefit percentage under the plan is 1.8 percent, the base benefit  percentage under the plan is 1.125 percent, and the disparity provided  under the plan at age 64 is 0.675 percent. Similarly, a benefit payable  at age 63 is equal to 85 percent of the normal retirement benefit  payable at age 65. Thus, the excess benefit percentage under the plan is  1.7 percent, the base benefit percentage under the plan is 1.0625  percent, and the disparity provided under the plan at age 63 is 0.6375  percent. Finally, a benefit payable at age 62 is equal to 80 percent of  the normal retirement benefit payable at age 65. Thus, the excess  benefit percentage under the plan is 1.6 percent, the base benefit  percentage under the plan is 1.0 percent, and the disparity provided  under the plan at age 62 is 0.6 percent. Because the disparities  provided under the plan at each early commencement age do not exceed the  factors provided in the applicable table in paragraph (e)(3) of this  section, the plan does not fail to satisfy paragraphs (b) and (e) of  this section with respect to the early retirement benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Plan P is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 0.75 percent of average annual compensation  up to the integration level, plus 1.5 percent of average annual  compensation in excess of the integration level, for each year of  service up to 35. The plan does not provide any benefits, other than  normal retirement benefits, commencing before an employee's social  security retirement age. Employee A, born in 1947, has a social security  retirement age of 66. Because the plan provides for the distribution of  normal retirement benefits before Employee A's social security  retirement age, the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess allowance  applicable to Employee A must be reduced to 0.70 percent in accordance  with this paragraph (e). Accordingly, the disparity provided to A under  the plan exceeds the maximum excess allowance because the excess benefit  percentage (1.5 percent) exceeds the base benefit percentage (0.75  percent) by more than the maximum excess allowance of 0.70 percent, as  reduced in accordance with this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except that the  plan also provides an early retirement benefit, commencing at age 62, to  an employee who satisfies the conditions for early retirement specified  in the plan. The early retirement benefit is based upon the employee's  accrued benefit at early retirement age and equals the amount that would  have been paid commencing at the employee's normal retirement age based  upon the employee's average annual compensation, covered compensation  and years of service at the date of the employee's early retirement.  Employee B, who has a social security retirement age of 65, meets the  conditions for early retirement under the plan and retires at age 62  with 30 years of service. At the time of early retirement, Employee B   has average annual compensation of $20,000 and covered compensation of  $16,000. Under the plan's benefit formula, Employee B has accrued a  normal retirement benefit, commencing at age 65, of $5,400 ((22.5  percentx$16,000)+(45 percentx$4,000)) based on Employee B's average  annual compensation, covered compensation and years of service at early  retirement. Accordingly, under the plan's early retirement provisions,  Employee B is entitled to receive, commencing at early retirement, a  benefit of $5,400. Because the early retirement benefit is a benefit  commencing at age 62 (before Employee B's social security retirement  age), the 0.75-percent factor in the maximum excess allowance must be  reduced to 0.60 percent in accordance with this paragraph (e).  Accordingly, the disparity provided to Employee B under the plan at  early retirement exceeds the maximum excess allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)</em>-12. The effect of the supplement is to provide an  employee with a uniform benefit of 2 percent of average annual  compensation from early retirement until age 65, when the supplement is  no longer payable. Therefore, for purposes of this paragraph (e), the  employee's benefit will be considered to commence at age 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume that Plan Q is instead an offset plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation,  minus 0.65 percent of final average compensation up to the offset level,  for each year of service up to 35. The plan provides the same early  retirement benefit on the same conditions, except that the supplement is  0.65 percent of an employee's final average compensation up to the  offset level. An employee at age 55 thus receives a uniform benefit of 2  percent of average annual compensation until age 65, when the supplement  is no longer payable. Therefore, for purposes of this paragraph (e), the  employee's benefit will be considered to commence at age 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Benefits, rights, and features--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Defined benefit excess plan.  In the case of a defined benefit excess plan, each benefit, right, or  feature provided under the plan with respect to employer-provided  benefits attributable to average annual compensation above the  integration level (an ``excess benefit, right, or feature'') must also  be provided on the same terms with respect to employer-provided benefits  attributable to average annual compensation up to the integration level  (a ``base benefit, right, or feature''). Alternatively, an excess  benefit, right, or feature may be provided on different terms than the  base benefit, right, or feature, if the terms used to determine the base  benefit, right, or feature produce a benefit, right, or feature of  inherently equal or greater value than the benefit, right, or feature  that would be produced under the terms used to determine the excess  benefit, right, or feature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Offset plan. In the case of an offset plan, each benefit, right,  or feature provided under the plan with respect to employer-provided  benefits before application of the offset (a ``gross benefit, right, or  feature'') must be provided on the same terms as those used to determine  the offset applied to the gross benefit, right, or feature.  Alternatively, a gross benefit, right, or feature may be provided on  different terms from those used to determine the offset applied to the  gross benefit, right, or feature, if the terms used to determine the  gross benefit, right, or feature produce a benefit, right, or feature of  inherently equal or greater value than the benefit, right, or feature  that would be produced under the terms used to determine the offset  applied to the gross benefit, right, or feature. In addition, if  benefits commence before an employee's normal retirement age, the gross  benefit percentage under the plan must be reduced by a number of  percentage points that is not less than the number of percentage points  by which the offset percentage must be reduced, from normal retirement  age to the age at which benefits commence, under the rules of paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section. In the case of a  defined benefit excess plan, the plan uses each employee's covered  compensation as the integration level; in the case of an offset plan,  the plan uses each employee's covered compensation as the offset level  and provides that an employee's final average compensation is limited to  the employee's average annual compensation. Each example discusses the  benefit formula applicable to an employee who has a social security  retirement age of 65. All optional forms of benefit under each plan are  provided on the same terms.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan M is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 1 percent of average annual compensation up  to the integration level, plus 1.65 percent of average annual  compensation above the integration level, for each year of service up to  35. The plan provides an early retirement benefit for any employee who  terminates employment at or after age 55 with 10 or more years of  service. In determining an employee's early retirement, the 1.65 percent  excess benefit percentage is reduced in accordance with the table in  paragraph (e)(3) of this section for a plan that uses a single disparity  factor of 0.65 percent for all employees at age 65. However, a larger  reduction factor is applied to determine the base benefit percentage at  early retirement. The plan violates this paragraph (f) because the  excess early retirement benefit is not provided on the same terms as the  base early retirement benefit, nor do the terms used to determine the  base early retirement benefit produce an early retirement benefit of  inherently equal or greater value than the early retirement benefit that  would be produced under the terms used to determine the excess benefit,  right, or feature.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that the  plan determines the early retirement benefit by applying the same  reduction factors under paragraph (e)(3) of this section to the base and  excess benefit percentages. Furthermore, if an employee terminates  employment at or after age 55 with 30 or more years of service, the plan  provides that the base benefit percentage of 1 percent is not reduced.  Although the excess early retirement benefit is provided on different  terms than the base early retirement benefit, the plan satisfies this  paragraph (f) because the terms used to determine the base early  retirement benefit produce an early retirement of inherently equal or  greater value than the early retirement benefit that would be produced  under the terms used to determine the excess benefit, right, or feature.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan N is an offset plan that provides a normal  retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation, minus  0.65 percent of final average compensation up to the offset level, for  each year of service up to 35. In determining the qualified joint and  survivor (``QJSA'') form of the normal retirement benefit, the plan  applies a factor of 80 percent to the gross benefit percentage and a  factor of 100 percent to the offset percentage. Thus, the QJSA form is  1.6 percent of average annual compensation, minus 0.65 percent of final  average compensation up to the offset level, for each year of service up  to 35. The plan violates this paragraph (f) because the gross QJSA form  is not provided on the same terms as the terms used to determine the  offset applied to the QJSA, nor does it produce a QJSA benefit that is  of inherently equal or greater value than the QJSA benefit that would be  produced under the terms used to determine the offset under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Plan O is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 1 percent of average annual compensation up  to the integration level, plus 1.65 percent of average annual  compensation above the integration level, for each year of service up to  35. The plan also provides a single sum optional form of benefit  determined by applying a single interest rate and mortality assumption  to the entire normal retirement benefit. The plan satisfies this  paragraph (f) because the excess optional form is provided on the same  terms as the base optional form. The plan would also satisfy this  paragraph (f) if it used a lower interest rate to determine the base  optional form than used to determine the excess optional form because  the lower interest rate would produce an optional form of inherently  equal or greater value than the optional form produced by using the same  interest rate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Plan R is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 1 percent of average annual compensation up  to the integration level, plus 1.65 percent of average annual  compensation above the integration level, for each year of service up to  35. If an employee continues to work after normal retirement age, the  plan provides that the employee receives credit for additional years of  service up to the service limit of 35. The plan also provides that the  disparity provided under the plan will increase as permitted under  paragraph (e) of this section for benefits commencing after social  security retirement age. However, the plan does not provide an increase  in the base benefit percentage to reflect the fact that the employee has  delayed commencement of   benefits past normal retirement age. Thus, for example, for an employee  at age 68, the plan provides a benefit of 1 percent of average annual  compensation up to the integration level, plus 1.86 percent of average  annual compensation above the integration level, for each year of  service up to 35. The plan violates this paragraph (f) because the  excess benefit provided for an employee after normal retirement age is  not provided on the same terms as the base benefit, nor do the terms  used to determine the base benefit produce a benefit of inherently equal  or greater value than the benefit that would be produced under the terms  used to determine the excess benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Plan Q is an offset plan that provides a normal  retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation, minus  0.65 percent of final average compensation up to the offset level, for  each year of service up to 35. In accordance with paragraph (e) of this  section, the plan reduces the offset percentage under the plan for early  retirement and provides a benefit at age 55 of 2 percent of average  annual compensation, minus 0.325 percent of final average compensation  up to the offset level, for each year of service up to 35. However, the  early retirement benefit does not meet this paragraph (f) because an  employee's gross benefit percentage is not reduced for early retirement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The facts are the same as in Example 6 except that the  plan reduces the gross benefit percentage for early retirement at age 55  to 1.675 percent. Because the gross benefit percentage is reduced by  0.325 percent (from 2.0 percent to 1.675 percent), the same percentage  point reduction made in the offset percentage (from 0.65 percent to  0.325 percent), the early retirement benefit meets this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> No reductions in 0.75-percent factor for ancillary benefits. For  purposes of applying the maximum excess allowance or the maximum offset  allowance under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, no reduction is  made to the 0.75-percent factor merely because the plan provides  disparity in qualified disability benefits (within the meaning of  section 411(a)(9)) or preretirement death benefits and the relevant  benefits are payable before an employee's social security retirement  age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Benefits attributable to employee contributions not taken into  account. Benefits attributable to employee contributions to a defined  benefit plan are not taken into account in determining whether the  disparity provided under a defined benefit excess plan or an offset plan  exceeds the maximum permitted disparity described in paragraph (b) of  this section. See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-6(b) for methods of determining the  employer-provided benefit under a plan that includes employee  contributions not allocated to separate accounts (i.e., a contributory  DB plan), including Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-6(b)(2)(iii)(B) for adjustments to  the base and excess benefit percentages or the gross benefit percentage  under a section 401(l) plan. If, after adjustment, the employee's base  benefit percentage or gross benefit percentage (whichever is applicable)  is less than zero, such percentage is deemed to be zero for purposes of  the maximum excess allowance or maximum offset allowance under paragraph  (b)(2) or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Multiple integration levels [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Additional rules.

The overall permitted disparity  rules of Sec. 1.401(l)-5 apply to employees who benefit under a plan  maintained by a railroad employer.  [T.D. 8359, 56 FR 47632, Sept. 19, 1991; 57 FR 10819, 10952, Mar. 31,  1992]    Sec. 1.401(l)-5  Overall permitted disparity limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The maximum excess allowance and  maximum offset allowance limit the disparity that can be provided under  a plan for a plan year. The overall permitted disparity rules apply to  limit the disparity provided for a plan year if an employee benefits  under more than one plan maintained by the employer (the ``annual  overall permitted disparity limit'') and to limit the disparity provided  for an employee's total years of service, either in a single plan or in  more than one plan of the employer (the ``cumulative overall permitted  disparity limit''). The overall permitted disparity rules take into  account the disparity provided under a section 401(l) plan and the  permitted disparity imputed under a plan that satisfies section  401(a)(4) by relying on Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7. A plan that is not a  section 401(l) plan is generally deemed to impute permitted disparity  under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7 unless established otherwise. Paragraph (b) of  this section provides rules on the annual overall permitted disparity  limit. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules on the cumulative  overall permitted disparity limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan requirements. In order to satisfy section 401(l), a plan  must provide that the overall permitted disparity limits may not be  exceeded and must specify how employer-provided contributions or  benefits under the plan are adjusted, if necessary, to satisfy the  overall permitted disparity limits. Any adjustments made to satisfy the  overall permitted disparity limits must be made in a uniform manner for  all employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plans taken into account. For purposes of this section, all  plans of the employer are taken into account. In addition, all plans of  any other employer are taken into account for all periods of service  with the other employer for which the employee receives credit for  purposes of benefit accrual under any plan of the current employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Annual overall permitted disparity limit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If, in  the plan year, an employee benefits under more than one plan, the annual  overall permitted disparity limit is satisfied only if the employee's  total annual disparity fraction, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, does not exceed one. Paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(8) of this  section explain the determination of an employee's annual disparity  fractions. Paragraph (b)(9) of this section provides examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Total annual disparity fraction. An employee's total annual  disparity fraction is the sum of the employee's annual disparity  fractions, as defined in paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(7) of this  section. An employee's total annual disparity fraction is determined as  of the end of the current plan year, based on the employee's annual  disparity fractions under all plans with plan years ending in the  current plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Annual defined contribution plan disparity fraction. For a plan  year, the annual defined contribution plan disparity fraction for an  employee benefiting under a defined contribution plan that is a section  401(l) plan is a fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of which is the disparity provided under the plan  for the plan year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator of which is the maximum excess allowance under  Sec. 1.401(l)-2(b)(2) for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Annual defined benefit excess plan disparity fraction. For a  plan year, the annual defined benefit excess plan disparity fraction for  an employee benefiting under a defined benefit excess plan that is a  section 401(l) plan is a fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of which is the disparity provided under the plan  for the plan year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator of which is the maximum excess allowance under  Sec. 1.401(l)-3(b)(2) for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Annual offset plan disparity fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For a  plan year, the annual offset plan disparity fraction for an employee  benefiting under an offset plan that is a section 401(l) plan is a  fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The numerator of which is the disparity provided under the plan  for the plan year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The denominator of which is the maximum offset allowance under  Sec. 1.401(l)-3(b)(3) for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PIA offset plans. In the case of an offset plan that applies an  offset of a specified percentage of the employee's PIA, as permitted  under Sec. 1.401(l)-3(c)(2)(ix), the numerator of the annual offset  plan disparity fraction is the offset percentage used in the section  401(l) overlay under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Annual imputed disparity fraction. For a plan year, the annual  imputed disparity fraction for an employee benefiting under a plan that  imputes permitted disparity with respect to the employee under Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-7 is one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Annual nondisparate fraction. For a plan year, the annual  nondisparate fraction for an employee benefiting under a plan that  neither is a section 401(l) plan nor imputes permitted disparity under  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7 is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Determination of fraction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A separate annual  disparity fraction is generally determined for each plan under which the  employee benefits. Thus, for example, if two plans are aggregated and  treated as a single plan for purposes of section 401(a)(4), a single  annual disparity fraction applies to the aggregated plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple formulas. If a plan provides an allocation or benefit  equal to the sum of two or more formulas, each formula is considered a  separate plan for purposes of this section. If a plan provides an  allocation or benefit equal to the greater of two or more formulas, an  annual disparity fraction is calculated for the employee under each  formula and the largest of the fractions is the employee's annual  disparity fraction under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Offset arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If an employee benefits  under two plans taken into account under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section as described in paragraph (b)(8)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section,  the employee's annual disparity fraction under both plans is the larger  of the annual disparity fractions calculated separately under each plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Defined benefit plans. The employee's employer-provided accrued  benefit under a defined benefit plan is offset by the employee's total  employer-provided accrued benefit under another defined benefit plan or  by the actuarial equivalent (as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-12) of the  employee's total account balance under a defined contribution plan that  is attributable to employer contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Defined contribution plans. The amount allocated to the  employee's account under a defined contribution plan is offset by the  total amount allocated to the employee's account under another defined  contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Applicable percentages. The disparity provided under a plan is  determined on the base and excess percentages under an excess plan and  the offset percentage under an offset plan, regardless of whether the  employee's plan year or average annual compensation exceeds the  integration or offset level under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fractional accrual plans. If a section 401(l) plan determines  each employee's accrued benefit under the fractional accrual method of  section 411(b)(1)(C), the numerator of an employee's annual disparity  fraction is based on the disparity provided in the benefit accrued for  the employee for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b).  Except as otherwise provided, each plan is a section 401(l) plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Employee A benefits for the plan year under a defined  contribution excess plan, Plan X, and a defined benefit excess plan,  Plan Y, of the employer. Plans X and Y have the same plan year. Employee  A benefits under no other plan of the employer for the plan year of any  other plan ending in the plan year of Plans X and Y. Plan X provides a  base contribution percentage of 5 percent and an excess contribution  percentage of 7 percent, thus providing Employee A with disparity of 2  percent for the plan year. The maximum excess allowance for the plan  year under Plan X is 5 percent. Plan Y provides a base benefit  percentage of 1 percent and an excess benefit percentage of 1.35  percent, thus providing Employee A with disparity of 0.35 percent for  the plan year. The maximum excess allowance for the plan year under Plan  Y is 0.75 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employee A's annual defined contribution plan disparity fraction  under Plan X for the plan year is 0.4 (2 percent divided by 5 percent).  Employee A's annual defined benefit excess plan disparity fraction under  Plan Y for the plan year is 0.47 (0.35 percent divided by 0.75 percent).  Employee A's total annual disparity fraction is the sum of 0.4 and 0.47  or 0.87. Because Employee A's total annual disparity fraction does not  exceed one, the plans satisfy the annual overall permitted disparity  limit with respect to Employee A for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Plan Y is a defined contribution plan, rather than a defined benefit  plan. Plan X and Plan Y cover the same employees and are identical in  their terms except for the base and excess contribution percentages  provided under the plans. Plan Y provides a base contribution percentage  of 3 percent and an excess contribution percentage of 6 percent, thus  providing Employee A with disparity of 3 percent for the plan year. The  maximum excess allowance for the plan year under Plan Y is 3 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employee A's annual defined contribution plan disparity fraction  under Plan X for the plan year is 0.4 (2 percent divided by 5 percent).  Employee A's annual defined contribution plan disparity fraction under  Plan Y for the plan year is 1 (3 percent divided by 3 percent). Because  Employee A's total annual disparity fraction (the sum of 0.4 and 1 or  1.4) exceeds one, the plans do not satisfy the annual overall permitted  disparity requirements with respect to Employee A for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Plan X and Plan Y are aggregated for purposes of section  401(a)(4) and form a single section 401(l) plan. Under the plan, the  base contribution percentage is 8 percent (5 percent plus 3 percent),  and the excess contribution percentage is 13 percent (7 percent plus 6  percent). A single annual defined contribution plan disparity fraction  is determined for Employee A for the plan year, the numerator of which  is the disparity of 5 percent provided under the plan (13 percent minus  8 percent), and the denominator of which is 5.7 percent, the maximum  excess allowance that applies to the plan. Because Employee A's only  annual disparity fraction of 0.88 (5 percent divided by 5.7 percent)  does not exceed one, Employee A's total annual disparity fraction also  does not exceed one. The plan thus satisfies the annual overall  permitted disparity limit with respect to Employee A for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that Plan X  and Plan Y use different integration levels. Therefore, when Plan X and  Plan Y are aggregated to form a single plan for purposes of section  401(a)(4), the single plan does not satisfy section 401(l). In applying  the general test of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-2(c), the plan imputes disparity  under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7. Employee A's only annual disparity fraction  is the annual imputed disparity fraction of one. Employee A's total  annual disparity fraction is also one, and the plan satisfies the annual  overall permitted disparity limit with respect to Employee A for the  plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(4)</em>. Employee B's imputed  disparity fraction under Plan N is therefore one, and Plan M provides no  disparity for Employee B for the plan year. As   a result, Plan M provides disparity that is neither uniform nor deemed  uniform under Sec. 1.401(l)-3(c); Plan M therefore does not satisfy  section 401(l).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Assume instead that Plan M provides that the annual overall  permitted disparity limits must be satisfied without reducing the  disparity provided for an employee under Plan M, thus requiring a  reduction in the employee's annual disparity fraction under another  plan. In that case, the disparity provided under Plan M would be uniform  for the plan year and Plan M would continue to satisfy section 401(l).  However, imputation of permitted disparity with respect to Employee B  would not be allowed under Plan N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cumulative permitted disparity limit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Employees who benefit under defined benefit plans. In the case of an  employee who has benefited under one or more defined benefit plans for a  plan year described in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, the  cumulative permitted disparity limit is satisfied if the employee's  cumulative disparity fraction, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, does not exceed 35.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employees who do not benefit under defined benefit plans. In  the case of an employee who has not benefited under a defined benefit  plan for any plan year described in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section,  the cumulative permitted disparity limit is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certain plan years disregarded. For purposes of this paragraph  (c), an employee is not treated as benefiting under a defined benefit  plan for a plan year described in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section if  the employer can establish that for that plan year the defined benefit  plan was not a section 401(l) plan and did not impute permitted  disparity under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Determination of type of plan. For purposes of this paragraph  (c), a target benefit plan that relies on the special rule of Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(3) to satisfy section 401(a)(4) and a DB/DC plan within  the meaning of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(a) are treated as defined benefit  plans. Similarly, a cash balance plan that relies on the special rule of  Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(c)(3) to satisfy section 401(a)(4) is treated as a  defined contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Applicable plan years. In applying paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii),  and (iii) of this section, for purposes of determining whether an  employee benefits under a defined benefit plan, the applicable plan  years are all plan years that begin on or after the regulatory effective  date, as set forth in Sec. 1.401(l)-6(b), or, in the case of  governmental plans, as set forth in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Transition rule for defined contribution plans. A defined  contribution plan is deemed to satisfy the cumulative permitted  disparity limit for the first plan year to which these regulations  apply, as set forth in Sec. 1.401(l)-6(b), or, in the case of  governmental plans, as set forth in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-13(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section, attributable  to the employee's total years of service under all plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> with  respect to all employees, using a year (including the current year) that  is chosen by the employer and is later than 1989. Thus, for example, in  lieu of calculating annual disparity fractions for all plan years, the  employer may assume that the full disparity limit has been used in each  prior plan year for which an employee has been credited with a year of  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for greater of formulas and offset arrangements-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Greater of formulas--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A defined benefit plan that is  a section 401(l) plan and that provides a benefit equal to the greater  of the benefits determined under two or more formulas is deemed to  satisfy the cumulative permitted   disparity limit with respect to an employee if each of the requirements  in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (B) and (C) of this section is satisfied. For  this purpose, a plan that uses a fresh-start formula that determines the  accrued benefit as the greater of two amounts under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 13(c)(4) (ii) or (iii) provides a benefit equal to the greater of the  benefits determined under two or more formulas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B))</em>, for purposes of  determining whether that formula would satisfy the cumulative permitted  disparity limit if it were the only formula under the plan, the special  rule for prior years under paragraph (c)(3) of this section may be  disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> merely because  the employee benefits under another defined benefit plan, provided  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> With respect to each benefit formula under the plan, no years of  service taken into account under that benefit formula are taken into  account under a benefit formula of the other plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section would be satisfied if the  plans were treated as a single plan that provided a benefit equal to the  greater of the benefits provided under two or more formulas. For this  purpose, a formula consists of the sum of a formula for the years of  service taken into account under one plan and a formula for the years of  service taken into account under the other plan. Thus, each possible  combination of the formulas under the plans must satisfy paragraph  (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Offset arrangements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a defined benefit plan  is a section 401(l) plan and the benefit under the plan (the gross  benefit plan) is offset by the benefit under another plan (the  offsetting plan) in an offset arrangement described in paragraph  (b)(8)(iii)(B) of this section, the gross benefit plan is deemed to  satisfy the cumulative permitted disparity limit with respect to an  employee if each of the requirements in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) (B) and  (C) of this section is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Separate satisfaction by plans. This requirement is satisfied if  the gross benefit plan would satisfy the cumulative disparity limit if  no offset applied, and the offsetting plan satisfies the cumulative  permitted disparity limit, not taking into account the gross benefit  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> merely because the employee benefits under another defined  benefit plan, provided no years of service taken into account under a  benefit formula of any plan in the offset arrangement are also taken  into account under a benefit formula of the other plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c).  In each example the plan is noncontributory and, unless provided  otherwise, is the only plan ever maintained by the employer. Each plan  uses a normal retirement age of 65 and contains no provision that would  require a reduction in the 0.75-percent factor under Sec. 1.401(l)- 3(b)(2) or (3). Each example discusses the benefit formula applicable to  an employee who has a social security retirement age of 65.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Plan M is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 1 percent of average annual compensation up  to covered compensation, plus 1.75 percent of average annual  compensation   above covered compensation, for each year of service without limit. The  disparity provided under the plan for the plan year is 0.75 percent, the  excess benefit percentage of 1.75 percent minus the base benefit  percentage of 1 percent. The maximum excess allowance for the plan year  is 0.75 percent. Thus, each employee's annual defined benefit excess  plan disparity fraction under the plan for each plan year is one.  Because the plan contains no limit on the years of service taken into  account under the plan, the sum of the total annual disparity fractions  for a potential employee with more than 35 years of service will exceed  35. In addition, the plan does not provide that the overall permitted  disparity limits may not be exceeded as required by paragraph (a)(2) of  this section. The plan therefore does not satisfy the cumulative  permitted disparity limit of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Plan N is an offset plan that provides a normal  retirement benefit of 2 percent of average annual compensation, minus  0.75 percent of final average compensation up to the lesser of covered  compensation and average annual compensation, for each year of service  up to 35. The disparity provided under the plan for the plan year is  0.75 percent, the offset percentage. The maximum offset allowance for  the plan year is 0.75 percent. Thus, each employee's annual offset plan  disparity fraction under the plan for each plan year is one. Because the  plan limits the years of service taken into account under the plan to  35, the sum of the total annual disparity fractions for an employee  cannot exceed 35. The plan therefore satisfies the cumulative permitted  disparity limit of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Plan O is a defined benefit excess plan that provides a  normal retirement benefit of 0.75 percent of average annual compensation  up to covered compensation, plus 1.25 percent of average annual  compensation above covered compensation, for each year of service up to  45. The disparity provided under the plan for the plan year is 0.5  percent, the excess benefit percentage of 1.25 percent minus the base  benefit percentage of 0.75 percent. The maximum excess allowance for the  plan year is 0.75 percent. Thus, each employee's annual defined benefit  excess plan disparity fraction under the plan for each plan year is 0.67  (0.5 percent divided by 0.75 percent). Because the plan limits the years  of service taken into account under the plan to 45, the sum of the total  annual disparity fractions for an employee cannot exceed 30 (0.67x45).  The plan therefore satisfies the cumulative permitted disparity limit of  this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan P is a defined contribution excess plan. Plan P  provides a base contribution percentage of 6 percent and an excess  contribution percentage of 11.7 percent, thus providing disparity of 5.7  percent for the plan year. Because the maximum excess allowance for each  plan year under Plan P is 5.7 percent, each employee's annual defined  contribution plan disparity fraction under Plan P for each plan year is  one. Plan Q is a defined benefit excess plan maintained by the same  employer. Plan Q provides a base benefit percentage of 1 percent and an  excess benefit percentage of 1.75 percent for each year of service up to  35, thus providing disparity of 0.75 percent for the plan year. Because  the maximum excess allowance for each plan year under Plan Q is 0.75  percent, each employee's annual defined benefit excess plan disparity  fraction under Plan Q for each plan year is one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employee A benefits under Plan P for the 1980 through the 1994  plan years. The sum of Employee A's total annual disparity fractions  under Plan P is 15. (Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, Employee  A's annual disparity fraction for each year of service as of the end of  the 1988 plan year is one.) As of the 1995 plan year, Employee A no  longer benefits under Plan P and begins to benefit under Plan Q for the  first time. In order to satisfy the cumulative permitted disparity limit  of this paragraph (c), Plan Q must provide that no disparity will be  provided if the sum of an employee's total annual disparity fractions  reaches 35, taking into account the employee's annual defined  contribution plan disparity fractions under Plan P as well as the  employee's annual defined benefit excess plan disparity fractions under  Plan Q. Thus, after Employee A has benefited under Plan Q for 20 years,  Plan Q may not provide any disparity in additional benefits accrued for  Employee A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Plan O is a noncontributory defined benefit excess  plan. Plan O provides an employee whose social security retirement age  is 65 with the greater of the benefits determined under two formulas.  The first formula provides a benefit of 1 percent of average annual  compensation up to covered compensation, plus 1.75 percent of average  annual compensation above covered compensation, for each year of service  up to 35. The second formula provides a benefit of 1 percent of average  annual compensation up to covered compensation, plus 1.6 percent of  average annual compensation above covered compensation, for each year of  service up to 40.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(8)(ii)</em> of this section,  an employee's annual defined benefit excess plan fraction (and total  annual disparity fraction because the employee benefits only under   Plan O) for the plan year is the larger fraction under the two formulas  or one. Therefore, after 35 years, the employee has a cumulative  disparity fraction of 35. The disparity provided under the second  formula for years of service after 35 thus exceeds the cumulative  permitted disparity limit unless the plan qualifies for the special rule  in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(4)(i)</em> of this section, the plan is deemed to satisfy the cumulative  permitted disparity limit with respect to an employee whose social  security retirement age is 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional rules.

A plan that provides for  employee contributions or matching contributions must satisfy the  requirements of section 401(a)(4) relating to benefits, rights and  features in addition to the requirement regarding amounts described in  paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. For example, the right to make each  level of employee contributions and the right to each level of matching  contributions under the plan are benefits, rights or features subject to  the requirements of section 401(a)(4).

Whether an employer contribution is  made on account of an employee contribution or an elective deferral is  determined on the basis of all the relevant facts and circumstances,  including the relationship between the employer contribution and  employee actions outside the plan. An employer contribution made to a  defined contribution plan on account of contributions made by an  employee under an employer-sponsored savings arrangement that are not  held in a plan that is intended to be a qualified plan or other  arrangement described in Sec. 1.402(g)-1(b) is not a matching  contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employer contributions not on account of an employee  contribution or elective deferral--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General rule.

The  timing of contributions will not be treated as failing to satisfy the  requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(iii) merely because contributions  are occasionally made before the employees' performance of services with  respect to which the elective deferrals are made (or when the cash that  is subject to the cash or deferred elections would be currently  available, if earlier) in order to accommodate bona fide administrative  considerations and are not paid early with a principal purpose of  accelerating deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Employee contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section  401(m), this section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(m)-2 through 1.401(m)-5,  employee contributions are   contributions to a plan that are designated or treated at the time of  contribution as after-tax employee contributions (e.g., by treating the  contributions as taxable income subject to applicable withholding  requirements) and are allocated to an individual account for each  eligible employee to which attributable earnings and losses are  allocated. See Sec. 1.401(k)-1(a)(2)(ii). The term employee  contributions includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Employee contributions to the defined contribution portion of a  plan described in section 414(k);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employee contributions applied to the purchase of whole life  insurance protection or survivor benefit protection under a defined  contribution plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amounts attributable to excess contributions within the meaning  of section 401(k)(8)(B) that are recharacterized as employee  contributions under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Employee contributions to a plan or contract that satisfies the  requirements of section 403(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain contributions not treated as employee contributions.

Employee contributions  to a qualified cost-of-living arrangement described in section  415(k)(2)(B) are treated as employee contributions to a defined  contribution plan, without regard to the requirement that the employee  contributions be allocated to an individual account to which  attributable earnings and losses are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Nondiscrimination requirements for amount of contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Matching contributions and employee contributions.

Notwithstanding  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the requirements of this section are  treated as satisfied with respect to employee contributions and matching  contributions under a collectively bargained plan (or the portion of a  plan) that automatically satisfies section 410(b). See Sec. Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(5) and 1.410(b)-2(b)(7). Additionally, the requirements  of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b) do not apply to a governmental plan  (within the meaning of section 414(d)) maintained by a State or local  government or political subdivision thereof (or agency or  instrumentality thereof) and, accordingly such plans are not required to  comply with this section. See sections 401(a)(5)(G), 403(b)(12)(C) and  410(c)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Anti-abuse provisions. Sections 1.401(m)-1 through 1.401(m)-5  are designed to provide simple, practical rules that accommodate  legitimate plan changes. At the same time, the rules are intended to be  applied by employers in a manner that does not make use of changes in  plan testing procedures or other plan provisions to inflate  inappropriately the ACP for NHCEs (which is used as a benchmark for  testing the ACP for HCEs) or to otherwise manipulate the  nondiscrimination testing requirements of this paragraph (b). Further,  this paragraph (b) is part of the overall requirement that benefits or  contributions not discriminate in favor of HCEs. Therefore, a plan will  not be treated as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (b) if  there are repeated changes to plan testing procedures or plan provisions  that have the effect of distorting the ACP so as to increase  significantly the permitted ACP for HCEs, or otherwise manipulate the  nondiscrimination rules of this paragraph, if a principal purpose of the  changes was to achieve such a result.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Aggregation and restructuring--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph  (b)(4) contains the exclusive rules for aggregating and disaggregating  plans that provide for employee contributions and matching contributions  for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(m)-2 through 1.401(m)- 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation of employee contributions and matching  contributions within a plan. Except as otherwise specifically provided  in this paragraph (b)(4) and Sec. 1.401(m)-3(j)(6), a plan must be  subject to a single test under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with  respect to all employee contributions and matching contributions and all  eligible employees under the plan. Thus, for example, if two groups of  employees are eligible for matching contributions under a plan, all  employee contributions and matching contributions under the plan must be  subject to a single test, even if they have significantly different  features, such as different rates of match.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aggregation of plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The term plan means a  plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(a) and (b), after  application of the mandatory disaggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)- 7(c), and the permissive aggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d), as  modified by paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section. Thus, for example, two  plans (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) that are treated as a  single plan pursuant to the permissive aggregation rules of Sec.  1.410(b)-7(d) are treated as a single plan for purposes of sections  401(k) and 401(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Arrangements with inconsistent ACP testing methods. Pursuant to  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a single testing method must apply  with respect to all employee contributions and matching contributions  and all eligible employees under a plan. Thus, in applying the  permissive aggregation rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d), an employer may not  aggregate plans (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) that apply  inconsistent testing methods. For example, a plan (within the meaning of  Sec. 1.410(b)-7) that applies the current year testing method may not  be aggregated with another plan that applies the prior year testing  method. Similarly, an employer may not aggregate a plan (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7) that is using the ACP safe harbor  provisions of section 401(m)(11) or 401(m)(12) and another plan that is  using the ACP test of section 401(m)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disaggregation of plans and separate testing--(A) In general.  If employee contributions or matching contributions are included in a  plan (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) that is mandatorily  disaggregated under the rules of section 410(b) (as modified by this  paragraph (b)(4)), the matching contributions and employee contributions  under that plan must be disaggregated in a consistent manner. For  example, in the case of an employer that is treated as operating  qualified separate lines of business under section 414(r), if the  eligible employees under a plan which provides for employee  contributions or matching contributions are in more than one qualified  separate line of business, only those employees within each qualified  separate line of business may be taken into account in determining  whether each disaggregated portion of the plan complies with the  requirements of section 401(m), unless the employer is applying the  special rule for employer-wide plans in Sec. 1.414(r)-1(c)(2)(ii) with  respect to the plan. Similarly, if a plan that provides for employee  contributions or matching contributions under which employees are  permitted to participate before they have completed the minimum age and  service requirements of section 410(a)(1) applies section 410(b)(4)(B)  for determining whether the plan complies with section 410(b)(1), then  the plan must be treated as two separate plans, one comprising all  eligible employees who have met the minimum age and service requirements  of section 410(a)(1) and one comprising all eligible employees who have  not met the minimum age and service requirements of section 410(a)(1),  unless the plan is using the rule in Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(1)(iii)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Restructuring prohibited. Restructuring under Sec. 1.401(a)(4)- 9(c) may not be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of  section 401(m). See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-9(c)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certain disaggregation rules not applicable. The mandatory  disaggregation rules relating to section 401(k) plans and section 401(m)  plans set forth in Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(1) and to ESOP and non-   ESOP portions of a plan set forth in Sec. 1.410(b)-7(c)(2) shall not  apply for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.401(m)-2 through  1.401(m)-5. Accordingly, notwithstanding Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d)(2), an ESOP  and a non-ESOP which are different plans (within the meaning of section  414(l), as described in Sec. 1.410(b)-7(b)) are permitted to be  aggregated for these purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>,  the group of employees who are eligible to make employee contributions  or eligible to receive matching contributions must satisfy the  requirements of section 410(b) as if those employees were covered under  a separate plan. The determination of whether the separate plan  satisfies the requirements of section 410(b) must be made without regard  to the modifications to the disaggregation rules set forth in paragraph  (b)(4)(v) of this section. In addition, except as expressly permitted  under section 401(k), 410(b)(2)(A)(ii), or 416(c)(2)(A), employee  contributions, matching contributions and elective contributions taken  into account under Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(6) may not be taken into account  for purposes of determining whether any other contributions under any  plan (including the plan to which the employee contributions or matching  contributions are made) satisfy the requirements of section 401(a).

The ACP for a group of  eligible employees (either eligible HCEs or eligible NHCEs) for a plan  year or applicable year is the average of the ACRs of eligible employees  in the group for that year. The ACP for a group of eligible employees is  calculated to the nearest hundredth of a percentage point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of applicable year under current year and prior  year testing method. The ACP test is applied using the prior year  testing method or the current year testing method. Under the prior year  testing method, the applicable year for determining the ACP for the  eligible NHCEs is the plan year immediately preceding the plan year for  which the ACP test is being calculated. Under the prior year testing  method, the ACP for the eligible NHCEs is determined using the ACRs for  the eligible employees who were NHCEs in that preceding plan year,  regardless of whether those NHCEs are eligible employees or NHCEs in the  plan year for which the ACP test is being performed. Under the current  year testing method, the applicable year for determining the ACP for  eligible NHCEs is the same plan year as the plan year for which the ACP  test is being calculated. Under either method, the ACP for the eligible  HCEs is determined using the ACRs of eligible employees who are HCEs for  the plan year for which the ACP test is being performed. See paragraph  (c) of this section for additional rules for the prior year testing  method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of ACR--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The ACR of an eligible  employee for the plan year or applicable year is the sum of the employee  contributions and matching contributions taken into account with respect  to such employee (determined under the rules of paragraphs (a)(4) and  (5) of this section), and the qualified nonelective and elective  contributions taken into account under paragraph (a)(6) of this section  for the year, divided by the employee's compensation taken into account  for the year. The ACR is calculated to the nearest hundredth of a  percentage   point. If no employee contributions, matching contributions, elective  contributions, or qualified nonelective contributions are taken into  account under this section with respect to an eligible employee for the  year, the ACR of the employee is zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ACR of HCEs eligible under more than one plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General  rule. Pursuant to section 401(m)(2)(B), the ACR of an HCE who is an  eligible employee in more than one plan of an employer to which matching  contributions or employee contributions are made is calculated by  treating all contributions with respect to such HCE under any such plan  as being made under the plan being tested. Thus, the ACR for such an HCE  is calculated by accumulating all matching contributions and employee  contributions under any plan (other than a plan described in paragraph  (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) that would be taken into account under  this section for the plan year, if the plan under which the contribution  was made applied this section and had the same plan year. For example,  in the case of a plan with a 12-month plan year, the ACR for the plan  year of that plan for an HCE who participates in multiple plans of the  same employer that provide for matching contributions or employee  contributions is the sum of all such contributions during such 12-month  period that would be taken into account with respect to the HCE under  all plans in which the HCE is an eligible employee, divided by the HCE's  compensation for that 12-month period (determined using the compensation  definition for the plan being tested), without regard to the plan year  of the other plans and whether those plans are satisfying this section  or Sec. 1.401(m)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>  and the prohibition on aggregating plans with different plan years set  forth in Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d)(5)) are not aggregated under this paragraph  (a)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> for additional examples of the application of the parallel  rule under section 401(k)(3)(A). The example is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Employee A, an HCE with compensation of $120,000, is  eligible to make employee contributions under Plan S and Plan T, two  calendar-year profit-sharing plans of Employer H. Plan S and Plan T use  the same definition of compensation. Plan S provides a match equal to  50% of each employee's contributions and Plan T has no match. During the  current plan year, Employee A elects to contribute $4,000 in employee  contributions to Plan T and $4,000 in employee contributions to Plan S.  There are no other contributions made on behalf of Employee A. Each plan  must calculate Employee A's ACR by dividing the total employee  contributions by Employee A and matching contributions under both plans  by $120,000. Therefore, Employee A's ACR under each plan is 8.33%  ($4,000 + $4,000 + $2,000/$120,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employee contributions and matching contributions taken into  account under the ACP test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee contributions. An employee  contribution is taken into account in determining the ACR for an  eligible employee for the plan year or applicable year in which the  contribution is made.

Thus, for example, qualified  nonelective contributions that are made pursuant to Sec. 1.401(k)-3(b)  cannot be taken into account under the ACP test. Similarly, if a plan  switches from the current year testing method to the prior year testing  method pursuant to Sec. 1.401(m)-2(c)(1), qualified nonelective  contributions that are taken into account under the current year testing  method for a plan year may not be taken into account under the prior   year testing method for the next plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples.

The lowest matching rate for a group of NHCEs that is at  least half of all the NHCEs who make elective contributions (or 2 NHCEs)  is 50%. Because 400% is more than twice the plan's representative  matching rate and the matching contributions exceed 5% of compensation,  the full amount of matching contributions is not taken into account.

Similarly, excess aggregate contributions for a plan  year may not remain unallocated or be allocated to a suspense account  for allocation to one or more employees in any future year. In addition,  excess aggregate contributions may not be corrected using the  retroactive correction rules of Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-11(g).

This  paragraph (b)(2) contains the rules for correction of excess aggregate  contributions through a distribution from the plan. Correction through a  distribution generally involves a 4-step process. First, the plan must  determine, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the  total amount of excess aggregate contributions that must be distributed  under the plan. Second, the plan must apportion the total amount of  excess aggregate contributions among the HCEs in accordance with  paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Third, the plan must determine  the income allocable to excess aggregate contributions in accordance  with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. Finally, the plan must  distribute the apportioned contributions, together with allocable income  (or forfeit the apportioned matching contributions, if forfeitable) in  accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. Paragraph  (b)(2)(vi) of this section provides rules relating to the tax treatment  of these distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation of total amount to be distributed. The following  procedures must be used to determine the total amount of the excess  aggregate contributions to be distributed--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the dollar amount of excess aggregate contributions  for each HCE. The amount of excess aggregate contributions attributable  to an HCE for a plan year is the amount (if any) by which the HCE's  contributions taken into account under this section must be reduced for  the HCE's ACR to equal the highest permitted ACR under the plan. To  calculate the highest permitted ACR under a plan, the ACR of the HCE  with the highest ACR is reduced by the amount required to cause that  HCE's ACR to equal the ACR of the HCE with the next highest ACR. If a  lesser reduction would enable the plan to satisfy the requirements of  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, only this lesser reduction  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination of the total amount of excess aggregate  contributions. The process described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this  section must be repeated until the plan would satisfy the requirements  of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. The sum of all reductions  for all HCEs determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is  the total amount of excess aggregate contributions for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> if the plan would satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (a)(1)(i) of this section if the ACR for each HCE were determined after  the reductions described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Apportionment of total amount of excess aggregate  contributions among the HCEs. The following procedures must be used in  apportioning the total amount of excess aggregate contributions  determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section among the HCEs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Calculate the dollar amount of excess aggregate contributions  for each HCE. The contributions with respect to the HCE with the highest  dollar amount of contributions taken account under this section are  reduced by the amount required to cause that HCE's contributions to  equal the dollar amount of contributions taken into account under this  section for the HCE with the next highest dollar amount of such  contributions. If a lesser apportionment to the HCE would enable the  plan to apportion the total amount of excess aggregate contributions,  only the lesser apportionment would apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limit on amount apportioned to any HCE. For purposes of this  paragraph (b)(2)(iii), the contributions for an HCE   who is an eligible employee in more than one plan of an employer to  which matching contributions and employee contributions are made is  determined by adding together all contributions otherwise taken into  account in determining the ACR of the HCE under the rules of paragraph  (a)(3)(ii) of this section. However, the amount of contributions  apportioned with respect to an HCE must not exceed the amount of  contributions taken into account under this section that were actually  made on behalf of the HCE to the plan for the plan year. Thus, in the  case of an HCE who is an eligible employee in more than one plan of the  same employer to which employee contributions or matching contributions  are made and whose ACR is calculated in accordance with paragraph  (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the amount distributed under this paragraph  (b)(2)(iii) will not exceed such contributions actually contributed to  the plan for the plan year that are taken into account under this  section for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Apportionment to additional HCEs. The procedure in paragraph  (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section must be repeated until the total amount  of excess aggregate contributions have been apportioned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income allocable to excess aggregate contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General  rule. For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the income  allocable to excess aggregate contributions is equal to the allocable  gain or loss through the end of the plan year. See paragraph  (b)(2)(iv)(D) of this section for rules that apply to plan years  beginning before January 1, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Method of allocating income. A plan may use any reasonable  method for computing the income allocable to excess aggregate  contributions, provided that the method does not violate section  401(a)(4), is used consistently for all participants and for all  corrective distributions under the plan for the plan year, and is used  by the plan for allocating income to participants' accounts. See Sec.  1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(8). A plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for  computing the income allocable to excess contributions merely because  the income allocable to excess aggregate contributions is determined on  a date that is no more than 7 days before the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Alternative method of allocating income for the plan year. A  plan may allocate income to excess aggregate contributions for the plan  year by multiplying the income for the plan year allocable to employee  contributions, matching contributions and other amounts taken into  account under this section (including the contributions for the year),  by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess aggregate  contributions for the employee for the plan year, and the denominator of  which is the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Account balance attributable to employee contributions and  matching contributions and other amounts taken into account under this  section as of the beginning of the plan year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any additional such contributions for the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Plan years before 2008. For plan years beginning before January  1, 2008, the income allocable to excess aggregate contributions is  determined under Sec. 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(iv) (as it appeared in the April  1, 2007, edition of 26 CFR part 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Allocable income for recharacterized elective contributions. If  recharacterized elective contributions are distributed as excess  aggregate contributions, the income allocable to the excess aggregate  contributions is determined as if recharacterized elective contributions  had been distributed as excess contributions. Thus, income must be  allocated to the recharacterized amounts distributed using the methods  in Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em>, a distribution  of excess aggregate contributions must be in addition to any other  distributions made during the year and must be designated as a  corrective distribution by the employer. In the event of a complete  termination of the plan   during the plan year in which an excess aggregate contribution arose,  the corrective distribution must be made as soon as administratively  feasible after the date of termination of the plan, but in no event  later than 12 months after the date of termination. If the entire  account balance of an HCE is distributed prior to when the plan makes a  distribution of excess aggregate contributions in accordance with this  paragraph (b)(2), the distribution is deemed to have been a corrective  distribution of excess aggregate contributions (and income) to the  extent that a corrective distribution would otherwise have been  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Tax treatment of corrective distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corrective  distributions for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(vi), for plan  years beginning on or after January 1, 2008, a corrective distribution  of excess aggregate contributions (and allocable income) is includible  in the employee's gross income in the taxable year of the employee in  which distributed. The portion of the distribution that is treated as an  investment in the contract and is therefore not subject to tax under  section 72 is determined without regard to any plan contributions other  than those distributed as excess aggregate contributions. Regardless of  when the corrective distribution is made, it is not subject to the early  distribution tax of section 72(t). See paragraph (b)(4) of this section  for additional rules relating to the employer excise tax on amounts  distributed more than 2\1/2\ months (6 months in the case of certain  plans that include an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within  the meaning of section 414(w)) after the end of the plan year. See also  Sec. 1.402(c)-2, A-4, prohibiting rollover of distributions that are  excess aggregate contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Corrective distributions for plan years beginning before January  1, 2008. The tax treatment of corrective distributions for plan years  beginning before January 1, 2008, is determined under Sec. 1.401(m)- 2(b)(2)(vi) (as it appeared in the April 1, 2007, edition of 26 CFR Part  1). If the total amount of excess aggregate contributions determined  under this paragraph (b)(2), and excess contributions determined under  Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(2) distributed to a recipient under a plan for any  plan year is less than $100 (excluding income), a corrective  distribution of excess aggregate contributions (and income) is  includible in gross income in the recipient's taxable year in which the  corrective distribution is made, except to the extent the corrective  distribution is a return of employee contributions, or as provided in  paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Corrective distributions attributable to designated Roth  contributions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2)(vi)(A) and (B) of this  section, a distribution of excess aggregate contributions is not  includible in gross income to the extent it represents a distribution of  designated Roth contributions. However, the income allocable to a  corrective distribution of excess aggregate contributions that are  designated Roth contributions is taxed in accordance with paragraph  (b)(2)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section (i.e., in the same manner as income  allocable to a corrective distribution of excess aggregate contributions  that are not designated Roth contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No employee or spousal consent required. A  distribution of excess aggregate contributions (and income) may be made  under the terms of the plan without regard to any notice or consent  otherwise required under sections 411(a)(11) and 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of corrective distributions and forfeited  contributions as employer contributions. Excess aggregate contributions  (other than amounts attributable to employee contributions), including  forfeited matching contributions, are treated as employer contributions  for purposes of sections 404 and 415 even if distributed from the plan.  Forfeited matching contributions that are reallocated to the accounts of  other participants for the plan year in which the forfeiture occurs are  treated under section 415 as annual additions for the participants to  whose accounts they are reallocated and for the participants from whose  accounts they are forfeited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No reduction of required minimum distribution. A distribution  of excess aggregate contributions (and income) is not treated as a  distribution for purposes of determining whether the plan satisfies the  minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9). See Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5, A-9(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Partial correction. Any distribution of less than the entire  amount of excess aggregate contributions (and allocable income) is  treated as a pro rata distribution of excess aggregate contributions and  allocable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Matching contributions on excess contributions, excess deferrals  and excess aggregate contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Corrective distributions not  permitted. A matching contribution may not be distributed merely because  the contribution to which it relates is treated as an excess  contribution, excess deferral, or excess aggregate contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> regarding  the use of additional allocations to the accounts of NHCEs for the  purpose of correcting a discriminatory rate of matching contributions. A  plan is permitted to provide for which contributions are to be  distributed to satisfy the ACP test so as to avoid discriminatory  matching rates that would otherwise violate section 401(a)(4). For  example, the plan may provide that unmatched employee contributions will  be distributed before matched employee contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> No requirement for recalculation. If the distributions and  forfeitures described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made, the  employee contributions and matching contributions are treated as meeting  the nondiscrimination test of section 401(m)(2) regardless of whether  the ACP for the HCEs, if recalculated after the distributions and  forfeitures, would satisfy section 401(m)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to timely correct--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to correct within 2\1/2\  months after end of plan year. If a plan does not correct excess  aggregate contributions within 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan  year for which the excess aggregate contributions are made, the employer  will be liable for a 10% excise tax on the amount of the excess  aggregate contributions. See section 4979 and Sec. 54.4979-1 of this  chapter. Qualified nonelective contributions properly taken into account  under paragraph (a)(6) of this section for a plan year may enable a plan  to avoid having excess aggregate contributions, even if the  contributions are made after the close of the 2\1/2\ month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to correct within 12 months after end of plan year. If  excess aggregate contributions are not corrected within 12 months after  the close of the plan year for which they were made, the plan will fail  to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) for the plan year for  which the excess aggregate contributions were made and all subsequent  plan years in which the excess aggregate contributions remain in the  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> applies to a  distribution of excess aggregate contributions for a plan year beginning  on or after January 1, 2010 only where all the eligible NHCEs and  eligible HCEs are covered employees under the eligible automatic  contribution arrangement (within the meaning of Sec. 1.414(w)-1(e)(3))  for the entire plan year (or for the portion of the plan year that the  eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs are eligible employees).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph. See also Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b) for additional examples of  the parallel correction rules applicable to cash or deferred  arrangements. For purposes of these examples, none of the plans provide  for catch-up contributions under section 414(v). The examples are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer L maintains a plan that provides for  employee contributions and fully vested matching contributions. The plan  provides that failures of the ACP test are corrected by distribution. In  2006, the ACP for the eligible NHCEs is 6%. Thus, the ACP for the  eligible HCEs may not exceed 8%.

Average 9.33 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section as follows: the  matching and employee contributions of Employee C (the HCE with the  highest ACR) is reduced by 3% of compensation (or $3,000) in order to  reduce the ACR of that HCE to 9%, which is the ACR of Employee B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the ACP of the HCEs determined after the $3,000  reduction still exceeds 8%, further reductions in matching contributions  and employee contributions are necessary in order to reduce the ACP of  the HCEs to 8%. The employee contributions and matching contributions  for Employees B and C are reduced by an additional .5% of compensation  or $1,250 ($750 and $500 respectively). Because the ACP of the HCEs  determined after the reductions now equals 8%, the plan would satisfy  the requirements of (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The total amount of excess aggregate contributions ($4,250) is  apportioned among the HCEs under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section  first to the HCE with the highest amount of matching contributions and  employee contributions. Therefore, Employee A is apportioned $500 (the  amount required to cause A's matching contributions and employee  contributions to equal the next highest dollar amount of matching  contributions and employee contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Because the total amount of excess aggregate contributions has  not been apportioned, further apportionment is necessary. The balance  ($3,750) of the total amount of excess aggregate contributions is  apportioned equally among Employees A and B ($1,500 to each, the amount  required to cause their contributions to equal the next highest dollar  amount of matching contributions and employee contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Because the total amount of excess aggregate contributions has  not been apportioned, further apportionment is necessary. The balance  ($750) of the total amount of excess aggregate contributions is  apportioned equally among Employees A, B and C ($250 to each, the amount  required to allocate the total amount of excess aggregate contributions  for the plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Therefore, the plan will satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (a)(1) of this section if, by the end of the 12 month period following  the end of the 2006 plan year, Employee A receives a corrective  distribution of excess aggregate contributions equal to $2,250 ($500 +  $1,500 + $250) and allocable income, Employee B receives a corrective  distribution of $250 and allocable income and Employee C receives a  corrective distribution of $1,750 ($1,500 + $250) and allocable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee D is the sole HCE who is eligible to  participate in a cash or deferred arrangement maintained by Employer M.  The plan that includes the arrangement, Plan X, permits employee  contributions and provides a fully vested matching contribution equal to  50% of elective contributions. Plan X is a calendar year plan. Plan X  corrects excess contributions by recharacterization and provides that  failures of the ACP test are corrected by distribution. For the 2006  plan year, D's compensation is $200,000,   and D's elective contributions are $15,000. The actual deferral  percentages and actual contribution percentages for Employee D and the  other eligible employees under Plan X are shown in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Actual</p><p class="depth0">Actual deferral     contribution</p><p class="depth0">percentage        percentage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Employee D.........................              7.5                3.75 NHCEs..............................              4                  2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In February 2007, Employer M determines that D's actual  deferral ratio must be reduced to 6%, or $12,000, which requires a  recharacterization of $3,000 as an employee contribution. This increases  D's actual contribution ratio to 5.25% ($7,500 in matching contributions  plus $3,000 recharacterized as employee contributions, divided by  $200,000 in compensation). Since D's actual contribution ratio must be  limited to 4% for Plan X to satisfy the actual contribution percentage  test, Plan X must distribute 1.25% or $2,500 of D's employee  contributions and matching contributions together with allocable income.  If $2,500 in matching contributions and allocable income is distributed,  this will correct the excess aggregate contributions and will not result  in a discriminatory rate of matching contributions. See Example 8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that  Employee D also had elective contributions under Plan Y, maintained by  an employer unrelated to M. In January 2007, D requests and receives a  distribution of $1,200 in excess deferrals from Plan X. Pursuant to the  terms of Plan X, D forfeits the $600 match on the excess deferrals to  correct a discriminatory rate of match.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $3,000 that would otherwise have been recharacterized for  Plan X to satisfy the actual deferral percentage test is reduced by the  $1,200 already distributed as an excess deferral, leaving $1,800 to be  recharacterized. See Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(4)(i)(A). D's actual  contribution ratio is now 4.35% ($7,500 in matching contributions plus  $1,800 in recharacterized contributions less $600 forfeited matching  contributions attributable to the excess deferrals, divided by $200,000  in compensation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The matching and employee contributions for Employee D must be  reduced by .35% of compensation in order to reduce the ACP of the HCEs  to 4%. The plan must provide for forfeiture of additional matching  contributions to prevent a discriminatory rate of matching  contributions. See Example 8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that D  does not request a distribution of excess deferrals until March 2007.  Employer X has already recharacterized $3,000 as employee contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.402(g)-1(e)(6), the amount of excess deferrals is  reduced by the amount of excess contributions that are recharacterized.  Because the amount recharacterized is greater than the excess deferrals,  Plan X is neither required nor permitted to make a distribution of  excess deferrals, and the recharacterization has corrected the excess  deferrals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the 2006 plan year, Employee F defers $10,000  under Plan M and $6,000 under Plan N. Plans M and N, which have calendar  plan years are maintained by unrelated employers. Plan M provides a  fully vested, 100% matching contribution, does not take elective  contributions into account under section 401(m) or take matching  contributions into account under section 401(k) and provides that excess  contributions and excess aggregate contributions are corrected by  distribution. Under Plan M, Employee F is allocated excess contributions  of $600 and excess aggregate contributions of $1,600. Employee F timely  requests and receives a distribution of the $1,000 excess deferral from  Plan M and, pursuant to the terms of Plan M, forfeits the corresponding  $1,000 matching contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No distribution is required or permitted to correct the excess  contributions because $1,000 has been distributed by Plan M as excess  deferrals. The distribution required to correct the excess aggregate  contributions (after forfeiting the matching contribution) is $600  ($1,600 in excess aggregate contributions minus $1,000 in forfeited  matching contributions). If Employee F had corrected the excess  deferrals of $1,000 by withdrawing $1,000 from Plan N, Plan M would have  had to correct the $600 excess contributions in Plan M by distributing  $600. Since Employee F then would have forfeited $600 (instead of  $1,000) in matching contributions, Employee F would have had $1,000  ($1,600 in excess aggregate contributions minus $600 in forfeited  matching contributions) remaining of excess aggregate contributions in  Plan M. These would have been corrected by distributing an additional  $1,000 from Plan M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee G is the sole HCE in a profit sharing plan  under which the employer matches 100% of employee contributions up to 2%  of compensation, and 50% of employee contributions up to the next 4% of  compensation. For the 2008 plan year, Employee G has compensation of  $100,000 and makes a 7% employee contribution of $7,000. Employee G  receives a 4% matching contribution or $4,000. Thus, Employee G's actual  contribution ratio (ACR) is 11%. The actual contribution percentage for  the NHCEs is 5%, and the employer determines that Employee G's ACR must  be reduced to 7% to comply with the rules of section 401(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, the plan satisfies the requirements of section if  it distributes the unmatched employee contributions of $1,000,   and $2,000 of matched employee contributions with their related matches  of $1,000. This would leave Employee G with 4% employee contributions,  and 3% matching contributions, for an ACR of 7%. Alternatively, the plan  could distribute all matching contributions and satisfy this section.  However, the plan could not distribute $4,000 of Employee G's employee  contributions without forfeiting the related matching contributions  because this would result in a discriminatory rate of matching  contributions. See also Example 7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee H is an HCE in Employer X's profit sharing  plan, which matches 100% of employee contributions up to 5% of  compensation. The matching contribution is vested at the rate of 20% per  year. In 2006, Employee H makes $5,000 in employee contributions and  receives $5,000 of matching contributions. Employee H is 60% vested in  the matching contributions at the end of the 2006 plan year. In February  2007, Employer X determines that Employee H has excess aggregate  contributions of $1,000. The plan provides that only matching  contributions will be distributed as excess aggregate contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer X has two options available in distributing Employee  H's excess aggregate contributions. The first option is to distribute  $600 of vested matching contributions and forfeit $400 of nonvested  matching contributions. These amounts are in proportion to Employee H's  vested and nonvested interests in all matching contributions. The second  option is to distribute $1,000 of vested matching contributions, leaving  the nonvested matching contributions in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the second option is chosen, the plan must also provide a  separate vesting schedule for vesting these nonvested matching  contributions. This is necessary because the nonvested matching  contributions must vest as rapidly as they would have had no  distribution been made. Thus, 50% must vest in each of the next 2 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The plan will not satisfy the nondiscriminatory availability  requirement of section 401(a)(4) if only nonvested matching  contributions are forfeited because the effect is that matching  contributions for HCEs vest more rapidly than those for NHCEs. See Sec.  1.401(m)-2(b)(3)(v)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer Y maintains a calendar year profit sharing  plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement. Elective  contributions are matched at the rate of 100%. After-tax employee  contributions are permitted under the plan only for NHCEs and are  matched at the same rate. No employees make excess deferrals. Employee  J, an HCE, makes an $8,000 elective contribution and receives an $8,000  matching contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer Y performs the actual deferral percentage (ADP) and  the actual contribution percentage (ACP). To correct failures of the ADP  and ACP tests, the plan distributes to A $1,000 of excess contributions  and $500 of excess aggregate contributions. After the distributions,  Employee J's contributions for the year are $7,000 of elective  contributions and $7,500 of matching contributions. As a result,  Employee J has received a higher effective rate of matching  contributions than NHCEs ($7,000 of elective contributions matched by  $7,500 is an effective matching rate of 107 percent). If this amount  remains in Employee J's account without correction, it will cause the  plan to fail to satisfy section 401(a)(4), because only an HCE receives  the higher matching contribution rate. The remaining $500 matching  contribution may be forfeited (but not distributed) under section  411(a)(3)(G), if the plan so provides. The plan could instead correct  the discriminatory rate of matching contributions by making additional  allocations to the accounts of NHCEs.

A plan (other than a successor plan)  that uses the prior year testing method but has elected for its first  plan year to use that year as the applicable year for determining the  ACP for the eligible NHCEs is not treated as changing its testing method  in the second plan year and is not subject to the limitations on double  counting under paragraph   (a)(6)(vi) of this section for the second plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> First plan year defined.

A plan is a successor plan if  50% or more of the eligible employees for the first plan year were  eligible employees under another plan maintained by the employer in the  prior year that provides for employee contributions or matching  contributions. If a plan that is a successor plan uses the prior year  testing method for its first plan year, the ACP for the group of NHCEs  for the applicable year must be determined under paragraph (c)(4) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> cannot use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The recharacterization method of Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(3) to  correct excess contributions for a plan year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section to take  elective contributions into account under the ACP test (rather than the  ADP test); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rules of paragraph Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(6) to take  qualified matching contributions into account under the ADP test (rather  than the ACP test).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rules for plan coverage change--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A plan that uses  the prior year testing method that experiences a plan coverage change  during a plan year satisfies the requirements of this section for that  year only if the plan provides that the ACP for the NHCEs for the plan  year is the weighted average of the ACPs for the prior year subgroups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Optional rule for minor plan coverage changes. If a plan  coverage change occurs and 90% or more of the total number of the NHCEs  from all prior year subgroups are from a single prior year subgroup,  then, in lieu of using the weighted averages described in paragraph  (c)(4)(i) of this section, the plan may provide that the ACP for the  group of eligible NHCEs for the prior year under the plan is the ACP of  the NHCEs for the prior year of the plan under which that single prior  year subgroup was eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this paragraph (c)(4)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Plan coverage change. The term plan coverage change means a  change in the group or groups of eligible employees under a plan on  account of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The establishment or amendment of a plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A plan merger or spinoff under section 414(l);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A change in the way plans (within the meaning of Sec. 1.410(b)- 7) are combined or separated for purposes of Sec. 1.401(m)-1(b)(4)  (e.g., permissively aggregating plans not previously aggregated under  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d), or ceasing to permissively aggregate plans under  Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A reclassification of a substantial group of employees that has  the same effect as amending the plan (e.g., a transfer of a substantial  group of employees from one division to another division); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A combination of any of paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A)(1) through (4)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Prior year subgroup. The term prior year subgroup means all  NHCEs for the prior plan year who, in the prior year, were eligible  employees under a specific plan that provides for employee contributions  or matching contributions maintained by the employer and who would have  been eligible employees in the prior year under   the plan being tested if the plan coverage change had first been  effective as of the first day of the prior plan year instead of first  being effective during the plan year. The determination of whether an  NHCE is a member of a prior year subgroup is made without regard to  whether the NHCE terminated employment during the prior year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Weighted average of the ACPs for the prior year subgroups. The  term weighted average of the ACPs for the prior year subgroups means the  sum, for all prior year subgroups, of the adjusted ACPs for the plan  year. The term adjusted ACP with respect to a prior year subgroup means  the ACP for the prior plan year of the specific plan under which the  members of the prior year subgroup were eligible employees on the first  day of the prior plan year, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the number of NHCEs in the prior year subgroup and denominator  of which is the total number of NHCEs in all prior year subgroups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrate the application of  this paragraph (c)(4). See also Sec. 1.401(k)-2(c)(4) for examples of  the parallel rules applicable to the ADP test. The example is as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer B maintains two plans, Plan N and Plan P, each  of which provides for employee contributions or matching contributions.  The plans were not permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for  the 2005 testing year. Both plans use the prior year testing method.  Plan N had 300 eligible employees who were NHCEs for 2005, and their ACP  for that year was 6%. Plan P had 100 eligible employees who were NHCEs  for 2005, and the ACP for those NHCEs for that plan was 4%. Plan N and  Plan P are permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for the  2006 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The permissive aggregation of Plan N and Plan P for the 2006  testing year under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) is a plan coverage change that  results in treating the plans as one plan (Plan NP). Therefore, the  prior year ACP for the NHCEs under Plan NP for the 2006 testing year is  the weighted average of the ACPs for the prior year subgroups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The first step in determining the weighted average of the ACPs  for the prior year subgroups is to identify the prior year subgroups.  With respect to the 2006 testing year, an employee is a member of a  prior year subgroup if the employee was an NHCE of Employer B for the  2005 plan year, was an eligible employee for the 2005 plan year under  any section 401(k) plan maintained by Employer B, and would have been an  eligible employee in the 2005 plan year under Plan NP if Plan N and Plan  P had been permissively aggregated under Sec. 1.410(b)-7(d) for that  plan year. The NHCEs who were eligible employees under separate plans  for the 2005 plan year comprise separate prior year subgroups. Thus,  there are two prior year subgroups under Plan NP for the 2006 testing  year: the 300 NHCEs who were eligible employees under Plan N for the  2005 plan year and the 100 NHCEs who were eligible employees under Plan  P for the 2005 plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The weighted average of the ACPs for the prior year subgroups  is the sum of the adjusted ACP with respect to the prior year subgroup  that consists of the NHCEs who were eligible employees under Plan N, and  the adjusted ACP with respect to the prior year subgroup that consists  of the NHCEs who were eligible employees under Plan P. The adjusted ACP  for the prior year subgroup that consists of the NHCEs who were eligible  employees under Plan N is 4.5%, calculated as follows: 6% (the ACP for  the NHCEs under Plan N for the prior year) x 300/400 (the number of  NHCEs in that prior year subgroup divided by the total number of NHCEs  in all prior year subgroups), which equals 4.5%. The adjusted ACP for  the prior year subgroup that consists of the NHCEs who were eligible  employees under Plan P is 1%, calculated as follows: 4% (the ACP for the  NHCEs under Plan P for the prior year) x 100/400 (the number of NHCEs in  that prior year subgroup divided by the total number of NHCEs in all  prior year subgroups), which equals 1%. Thus, the prior year ACP for  NHCEs under Plan NP for the 2006 testing year is 5.5% (the sum of  adjusted ACPs for the prior year subgroups, 4.5% plus 1%).

An employee who would be eligible to make  employee contributions but for a suspension due to a distribution, a  loan, or an election not to participate in the plan, is treated as an  eligible employee for purposes of section 401(m) for a plan year even  though the employee may not make employee contributions or receive an  allocation of matching contributions by reason of the suspension.  Finally, an employee does not fail to be treated as an eligible employee  merely because the employee may receive no additional annual additions  because of section 415(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain one-time elections. An employee is not an eligible  employee merely because the employee, no later than the employee's first  becoming eligible under any plan or arrangement described in section  219(g)(5)(A) and providing for employee or matching contributions, is  given a one-time opportunity to elect, and the employee in fact does  elect, not to be eligible to make employee contributions or to receive  allocations of matching contributions under the plan or any other plan  or arrangement maintained by the employer (including plans not yet  established) for the duration of the employee's employment with the  employer. In no event is an election made after December 23, 1994,  treated as a one-time irrevocable election under this paragraph if the  election is made by an employee who previously became eligible under  another plan or arrangement (whether or not terminated) of the employer.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible HCE.

If an employer makes a contribution  for the benefit of an employee to a trust described in section 401(a)  for the taxable year of the employer which ends within or with a taxable  year of the trust for which the trust is exempt under section 501(a),  the employee is not required to include such contribution in his income  except for the year or years in which such contribution is distributed  or made available to him. It is immaterial in the case of contributions  to an exempt trust whether the employee's rights in the contributions to  the trust are forfeitable or nonforfeitable either at the time the  contribution is made to the trust or thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of section 402(a) relate only to a distribution  by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt under section  501(a) for the taxable year of the trust in which the distribution is  made. With two exceptions, the distribution from such an exempt trust  when received or made available is taxable to the distributee to the  extent provided in section 72 (relating to annuities). First, for  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, section 72(e)(3)  (relating to the treatment of certain lump sums), as in effect before  such date, shall not apply to such distributions. For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1963, such distributions may be taken into  account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to  income averaging). Secondly, certain total distributions described in  section 402(a)(2) are taxable as long-term capital gains. For the  treatment of such total distributions, see subparagraph (6) of this  paragraph. Under certain circumstances, an amount representing the  unrealized appreciation in the value of the securities of the employer  is excludable from gross income for the year of distribution. For the  rules relating to such exclusion, see paragraph (b) of this section.  Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules relating to use of a  qualified pension, annuity, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan to  provide   accident or health benefits or coverage otherwise described in sections  104, 105, or 106.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a  distribution of property by a trust described in section 401(a) and  exempt under section 501(a) shall be taken into account by the  distributee at its fair market value. In the case of a distribution of a  life insurance contract, retirement income contract, endowment contract,  or other contract providing life insurance protection, or any interest  therein, the policy cash value and all other rights under such contract  (including any supplemental agreements thereto and whether or not  guaranteed) are included in determining the fair market value of the  contract. In addition, in the case of a transfer of property that occurs  on or after August 29, 2005 where a trust described in section 401(a)  and exempt under section 501(a) transfers property to a plan participant  or beneficiary in exchange for consideration and where the fair market  value of the property transferred exceeds the value of the  consideration, then the excess of the fair market value of the property  transferred by the trust over the value of the consideration received by  the trust is treated as a distribution to the distributee under the plan  for all purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. Where such a transfer  occurs before that date, the excess of the fair market value of the  property transferred by the trust over the value of the consideration  received by the trust is includible in the gross income of the  participant or beneficiary under section 61. However, such a transfer of  a life insurance contract, retirement income contract, endowment  contract, or other contract providing life insurance protection  occurring before that date is not treated as a distribution for purposes  of applying the requirements of subchapter D of chapter 1 of subtitle A  of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a trust is exempt for the taxable year in which the  distribution occurs, but was not so exempt for one or more prior taxable  years under section 501(a) (or under section 165(a) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939 for years to which such section was applicable),  the contributions of the employer which were includible in the gross  income of the employee for the taxable year when made shall, in  accordance with section 72(f), also be treated as part of the  consideration paid by the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the trust is not exempt at the time the distribution is  received by or made available to the employee, see section 402(b) and  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.402(b)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For the treatment of amounts paid to provide medical benefits  described in section 401(h) as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.401- 14, see paragraph (h) of Sec. 1.72-15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a trust described in section 401(a) and exempt under section  501(a) purchases an annuity contract for an employee and distributes it  to the employee in a year in which the trust is exempt, and the contract  contains a cash surrender value which may be available to an employee by  surrendering the contract, such cash surrender value will not be  considered income to the employee unless and until the contract is  surrendered. For the rule as to nontransferability of annuity contracts  issued after 1962, see Sec. 1.401-9(b)(1). For additional requirements  regarding distributions of annuity contracts, see, e.g., Sec. Sec.  1.401(a)-20, Q&A-2;, 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-17;, and 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-4.;  However, the distribution of an annuity contract must be treated as a  lump sum distribution for purposes of determining the amount of tax  under the 10-year averaging rule of section 402(e) (as in effect prior  to amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514, 100 Stat.  2085). If, however, the contract distributed by such exempt trust is a  life insurance contract, retirement income contract, endowment contract,  or other contract providing life insurance protection, the fair market  value of the contract at the time of distribution must be included in  the distributee's income in accordance with the provisions of section  402(a), except to the extent that, within 60 days after the distribution  of the contract, all or any portion of such value is irrevocably  converted into a contract under which no part of any proceeds payable on  death at any time would be excludable under section   101(a) (relating to life insurance proceeds), or the contract is treated  as a rollover contribution under section 402(c). If the contract  distributed by such trust is a transferable annuity contract, or a  retirement income, endowment, or other life insurance contract and such  contract is not treated as a rollover contribution under section 402(c),  then, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the fair market value of  the contract is includible in the distributee's gross income unless,  within such 60 days, such contract is made nontransferable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the rules applicable to premiums paid by a trust described  in section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a) for the purchase of  retirement income, endowment, or other contracts providing life  insurance protection payable upon the death of the employee-participant,  see paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the rules applicable to the amounts payable by reason of the  death of an employee under a contract providing life insurance  protection, or an annuity contract, purchased by a trust described in  section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a), see paragraph (c) of  Sec. 1.72-16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If pension or annuity payments or other benefits are paid or  made available to the beneficiary of a deceased employee or a deceased  retired employee by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt  under section 501(a), such amounts are taxable in accordance with the  rules of section 402(a) and this section. In case such amounts are  taxable under section 72, the ``investment in the contract'' shall be  determined by reference to the amount contributed by the employee and by  applying the applicable rules of sections 72 and 101(b)(2)(D). In case  the amounts paid to, or includible in the gross income of, the  beneficiaries of the deceased employee or deceased retired employee  constitute a distribution to which subparagraph (6) of this paragraph is  applicable, the extent to which the distribution is taxable is  determined by reference to the contributions of the employee, by  reference to any prior distributions which were excludable from gross  income as a return of employee contributions, and by applying the  applicable rules of sections 72 and 101(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the total distributions payable with respect to any  employee under a trust described in section 401(a) which in the year of  distribution is exempt under section 501(a) are paid to, or includible  in the gross income of, the distributee within one taxable year of the  distributee on account of the employee's death or other separation from  the service, or death after such separation from service, the amount of  such distribution, to the extent it exceeds the net amount contributed  by the employee, shall be considered a gain from the sale or exchange of  a capital asset held for more than six months. The total distributions  payable are includible in the gross income of the distributee within one  taxable year if they are made available to such distributee and the  distributee fails to make a timely election under section 72(h) to  receive an annuity in lieu of such total distributions. The ``net amount  contributed by the employee'' is the amount actually contributed by the  employee plus any amounts considered to be contributed by the employee  under the rules of section 72(f), 101(b), and subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph, reduced by any amounts theretofore distributed to him which  were excludable from gross income as a return of employee contributions.  See, however, paragraph (b) of this section for rules relating to the  exclusion of amounts representing net unrealized appreciation in the  value of securities of the employer corporation. In addition, all or  part of the amount otherwise includible in gross income under this  paragraph by a non-resident alien individual in respect of a  distribution by the United States under a qualified pension plan may be  excludable from gross income under section 402(a)(4). For rules relating  to such exclusion, see paragraph (c) of this section. For additional  rules relating to the treatment of total distributions described in this  subdivision in the case of a nonresident alien individual, see sections  871 and 1441 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term ``total distributions payable'' means the balance to  the credit of an employee which becomes   payable to a distributee on account of the employee's death or other  separation from the service or on account of his death after separation  from the service. Thus, distributions made before a total distribution  (for example, annuity payments received by the employee after  retirement), will not defeat application of the capital gains treatment  with respect to the total distributions received by a beneficiary upon  the death of the employee after retirement. However, a distribution on  separation from service will not receive capital gains treatment unless  it constitutes the total amount in the employee's account at the time of  his separation from service. If the total amount in the employee's  account at the time of his death or other separation from the service or  death after separation from the service is paid or includible in the  gross income of the distributee within one taxable year of the  distributee, such amount is entitled to the capital gains treatment  notwithstanding that in a later taxable year an additional amount,  attributable to the last year of service, is credited to the account of  the employee and distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an employee retires and commences to receive an annuity but  subsequently, in some succeeding taxable year, is paid a lump sum in  settlement of all future annuity payments, the capital gains treatment  does not apply to such lump sum settlement paid during the lifetime of  the employee since it is not a payment on account of separation from the  service, or death after separation, but is on account of the settlement  of future annuity payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the ``total distributions payable'' are paid or includible  in the gross income of several distributees within one taxable year on  account of the employee's death or other separation from the service or  on account of his death after separation from the service, the capital  gains treatment is applicable. The total distributions payable are paid  within one taxable year of the distributees when, for example, a portion  of such total is distributed in cash to one distributee and the balance  is used to purchase an annuity contract which is distributed to the  other distributee. However, if the share of any distributee is not paid  or includible in his gross income within the same taxable year in which  the shares of the other distributees are paid or includible in their  gross income, none of the distributees is entitled to the capital gains  treatment, since the total distributions payable are not paid or  includible in the distributees' gross income within one taxable year.  For example, if the total distributions payable are made available to  each of two distributees and one elects to receive his share in cash  while the other makes a timely election under section 72(h) to receive  his share in installment payments from the trust, the capital gains  treatment does not apply to either distributee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For regulations as to certain plan terminations, see Sec.  1.402(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The term ``total distributions payable'' does not include  United States Retirement Plan Bonds held by a trust to the credit of an  employee. Thus, a distribution by a qualified trust may constitute a  total distributions payable with respect to an employee even though the  trust retains retirement plan bonds registered in the name of such  employee. Similarly, the proceeds of a retirement plan bond received as  a part of the total amount to the credit of an employee will not be  entitled to capital gains treatment. See section 405(e) and paragraph  (a)(4) of Sec. 1.405-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> For purposes of determining whether the total distributions  payable to an employee have been distributed within one taxable year,  the term ``total distributions payable'' includes amounts held by a  trust to the credit of an employee which are attributable to  contributions on behalf of the employee while he was a self-employed  individual in the business with respect to which the plan was  established. Thus, a distribution by a qualified trust is not a total  distributions payable with respect to an employee if the trust retains  amounts which are so attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The term ``total distributions payable'' does not include any  amount   which has been placed in a separate account for the funding of medical  benefits described in section 401(h) as defined in paragraph (a) of  Sec. 1.401-14. Thus, a distribution by a qualified trust may constitute  a total distributions payable with respect to an employee even though  the trust retains amounts attributable to the funding of medical  benefits described in section 401(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The capital gains treatment provided by section 402(a)(2) and  subparagraph (6) of this paragraph is not applicable to distributions  paid to a distributee to the extent such distributions are attributable  to contributions made on behalf of an employee while he was a self- employed individual in the business with respect to which the plan was  established. For the taxation of such amounts, see Sec. 1.72-18.

However, if the net  gain realized by the distributee in a subsequent taxable transaction  exceeds the amount of the net unrealized appreciation at the time of  distribution, such excess shall constitute a long-term or short-term  capital gain depending upon the holding period of the securities in the  hands of the distributee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of section 402(a) and of this section, the term  ``securities'' means only shares of stock and bonds or debentures issued  by a corporation with interest coupons or in registered form, and the  term ``securities of the employer corporation'' includes securities of a  parent or subsidiary corporation (as defined in subsections (e) and (f)  of section 425) of the employer corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of net unrealized appreciation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of  net unrealized appreciation in securities of the employer corporation  which are distributed by the trust is the excess of the market value of  such securities at the time of distribution over the cost or other basis  of such securities to the trust.

Whether a contribution to an exempt trust or plan described  in section 401(a) or 403(a) is made by the employer or the employee is  determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of  each case. Nevertheless, an amount contributed to a plan or trust will,  except as otherwise provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be  treated as contributed by the employee if it was contributed at the  employee's election, even though the election was made before the year  in which the amount was earned by the employee or before the year in  which the amount became currently available to the employee. Any amount  treated as contributed by the employee is includible in the gross income  of the employee for the year in which the amount would have been  received by the employee but for the election. Thus, for example,  amounts contributed to an exempt trust or plan by reason of a salary  reduction agreement under a cash or deferred arrangement are treated as  received by the employee when they would have been received by the  employee but for the election to defer. Accordingly, they are includible  in the gross income of the employee for that year (except as provided  under paragraph (d)(2) of this section).

For plan years beginning after December 31, 1992, whether a cash or  deferred election is made under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement  is determined without regard to the special rules for certain  collectively bargained plans contained in Sec. 1.401(k)-1(a)(5)(iv)(B).  As a result, elective contributions under these plans are treated as  employee contributions for purposes of this section if the cash or  deferred arrangement does not satisfy the actual deferral percentage  test of section 401(k)(3) or otherwise fails to be a qualified cash or  deferred arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Matching contributions. Matching contributions described in  Sec. 1.401(m)-1(a)(2) and section 401(m)(4) are not treated as  contributed by an employee merely because they are made by the employer  as a result of an employee's election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of certain one-time elections.

For plan years beginning prior to  January 1, 1980 (or, in the case of a pre-ERISA money purchase plan,  plan years beginning before July 19, 1984), the taxable year of  inclusion in gross income of the employee of any amount so contributed  by the employer to the trust is determined in a manner consistent with  Rev.

Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this  section, a payment made from a qualified trust that is a premium for  accident or health insurance (including a qualified long-term care  insurance contract under section 7702B) constitutes a distribution under  section 402(a) to the participant for whose benefit the premium is  charged. The amount of the distribution equals the amount of the premium  charged against the participant's benefits under the plan. If a defined  contribution plan pays these premiums from a current year contribution  or forfeiture that has not been allocated to a participant's account,  then the amount of the premium for each participant is treated as first  being allocated to the participant   and then charged against the participant's benefits under the plan, so  that the amount of the distribution is treated in the same manner as  determined under the preceding sentence. Except as provided in  paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, a distribution described  in this paragraph (e)(1) is not excludable from gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of amounts received through accident or health  insurance. To the extent that the payment of a premium for accident or  health insurance constitutes a distribution under this paragraph (e)(1),  amounts received through accident or health insurance are neither paid  by the employer nor attributable to contributions by the employer that  are excludable from the gross income of the employee. Accordingly, to  the extent the premium for accident or health insurance constitutes a  distribution under this paragraph (e)(1), amounts received through the  accident or health insurance for personal injuries or sickness are  excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3) and are not treated  as distributions from the plan. If those amounts are paid to the plan  instead of to the employee, those amounts are treated as having been  paid to the employee and then contributed by the employee to the plan  (and must satisfy the qualification requirements applicable to employee  contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Medical benefits for retired employees provided under an account  described in section 401(h). The payment of medical benefits under a  pension or annuity plan from an account described in section 401(h) is  treated in the same manner as a payment of accident or health benefits  attributable to employer contributions, or employer-provided coverage  under an accident or health plan. See Sec. 1.401-14(a) for the  definition of medical benefits described in section 401(h). Accordingly,  amounts applied for the payment of accident or health benefits, or for  the payment of accident or health coverage, from a section 401(h)  account are not includible in the gross income of the participant on  whose behalf such contributions are made to the extent they are  excludible from gross income under section 104, 105, or 106.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions to eligible retired public safety officers. See  section 402(l) (and any guidance issued under section 402(l)) for a  limited exclusion from gross income for distributions used to pay for  certain accident or health premiums (including premiums for qualified  long-term care insurance contracts). This limited exclusion applies to  eligible retired public safety officers, as defined in section  402(l)(4)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of distribution of insurance premiums on plan  qualification. See Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1) for rules concerning the types  and amount of medical coverage and benefits that are permitted to be  provided under a plan that is part of a trust described in section  401(a). For example, Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(ii) provides that a profit- sharing plan is primarily a plan of deferred compensation, but the  amounts allocated to the account of a participant may be used to provide  incidental accident or health insurance for the participant and the  participant's family. See also section 401(k)(2)(B) for certain  restrictions on   the distribution of elective contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Applicability to beneficiaries and alternate payees. This  paragraph (e) applies to the payment of premiums charged against the  benefits of a beneficiary or an alternate payee in the same manner as  the payment of premiums charged against the account of a participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer A sponsors a profit-sharing plan  qualified under section 401(a). The plan provides solely for non- elective employer profit-sharing contributions. The plan's trustee  enters into a contract with a third-party insurance carrier to provide  health insurance for certain plan participants. The insurance contract  provides for the payment of medical expenses incurred by those  participants. The plan limits the amounts used to provide medical  benefits to comply with the incidental benefit rules. The trustee makes  monthly payments of $1,000 to pay the premiums due for Participant P's  health insurance and Participant P's account balance is reduced by  $1,000 at the time of each premium payment. In June 2015, Participant P  is admitted to the hospital for covered medical care, and in July 2015,  the health insurer pays the hospital $5,000 for the medical care  provided to Participant P in June.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each of the  trustee's payments of $1,000 constitutes a taxable distribution under  section 402(a) to Participant P on the date of each payment. The amount  of these distributions may constitute payments for medical care under  section 213. The $5,000 payment to the hospital is excludable from  Participant P's gross income under section 104(a)(3) and is not treated  as a distribution from the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer B sponsors a profit-sharing plan  qualified under section 401(a). The plan provides for elective  contributions described in section 401(k) and matching contributions as  well as non-elective employer profit-sharing contributions. The plan  does not provide that a disabled participant's compensation for purposes  of determining plan contributions includes amounts that the participant  would have received in the absence of the disability, and accordingly  Employer B does not make any contributions to the plan for the benefit  of a disabled employee for the period of disability. The plan's trustee  enters into a contract with a third-party insurance carrier to provide  disability insurance for plan participants who elect to be covered under  the insurance contract. The insurance contract provides for the payment  of an amount to the trustee on a participant's behalf during the period  of the participant's disability. Amounts to be paid to the trustee from  the insurance contract with respect to a participant are equal to the  sum of the elective, matching, and non-elective employer profit-sharing  contributions that would have been made on the participant's behalf  during the participant's disability (based on the participant's rate of  compensation before becoming disabled) with the payments to continue for  the duration of the disability until age 65 (or 5 years after the  participant became disabled, if later). Participant Q elects to be  covered under the insurance contract, and the trustee makes the periodic  premium payments out of the account balance of Participant Q. In June  2015, Participant Q becomes disabled. During the period Participant Q is  absent from employment due to disability, the insurer pays the trust the  amount of the elective, matching, and non-elective employer profit- sharing contributions that would have been made to the trust with  respect to Participant Q had Participant Q not been disabled. The amount  of the premiums for the insurance contract satisfies the limitations on  incidental benefits under Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The payment of premiums from the trust is described  in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, none of the  premium payments under the contract constitute a distribution under  section 402(a) to Participant Q. Further, amounts paid from the  insurance contract to the trust also do not constitute a distribution to  Participant Q. However, when Participant Q's account balance is  distributed from the trust, the distribution will be subject to taxation  in the year of distribution in accordance with the rules in section 402.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Effective/applicability date.

(Temporary)</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: Can an employee or the surviving spouse of a deceased employee  roll over to an individual retirement account or annuity, described in  section 408 (a) or (b), the taxable portion of a partial distribution  from a   qualifiedtrust described in section 401(a), a qualified plan described  in section 403(a), or a tax-sheltered annuity contract under section  403(b)?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Yes. For distributions made after July 18, 1984, the taxable  portion of a partial distribution may be rolled over within 60 days of  the distribution to an individual retirement account or annuity.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Are there special requirements applicable to rollovers of  partial distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: Yes. Section 402(a)(5)(D)(i) specifies that no part of a  partial distribution may be rolled over unless the distribution is equal  to at least 50 percent of the balance to the credit of the employee in  the contract or plan immediately before the distribution, and the  distribution is not one of a series of periodic payments. For purposes  of this section, the balance to the credit of an employee does not  include any accumulated deductible employee contributions (within the  meaning of section 72(o)). In addition, in calculating the balance to  the credit for purposes of the 50 percent test, qualified plans are not  to be aggregated with other qualified plans and tax-sheltered annuity  contracts are not to be aggregated with other tax-sheltered annuity  contracts. Also, in applying the 50 percent test to a surviving spouse,  the balance to the credit is the maximum amount the spouse is entitled  to receive under the plan or contract, rather than the total balance to  the credit of the employee. The rollover of a partial distribution may  result in adverse tax consequences; see section 402(a)(5)(D) (iii) and  (iv).</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: Are there any other requirements applicable to rollovers of  partial distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: Yes. Section 402(a)(5)(D)(i)(III) requires the employee to  elect, in conformance with Treasury regulations, to treat a contribution  of a partial distribution to an IRA as a rollover contribution. An  election is made by designating, in writing, to the trustee or issuer of  the IRA at the time of the contribution that the contribution is to be  treated as a rollover contribution. This requirement of a written  designation to the trustee or issuer of the IRA is effective for  contributions paid to the trustee or issuer of the IRA after March 20,  1986. For contributions paid to the trustee or issuer before March 21,  1986, an election is made by computing the individual's income tax  liability on the income tax return for the taxable year in which the  distribution occurs in a manner consistent with not including the  distribution (or portion thereof) in gross income. Both such elections  are irrevocable, except that an election made on an income tax return  filed before March 21, 1986 is revocable.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Does the election requirement apply to rollovers of qualified  total distributions or rollover contributions described in section  402(a) (5) or (7), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 405(d)(3), or 408(d)(3) to  individual retirement accounts and annuities (IRAs)?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: Yes.

Generally, whether a series of payments is a  series of substantially equal periodic payments over a specified period  is determined at the time payments begin, and by following the  principles of section 72(t)(2)(A)(iv), without regard to contingencies  or modifications that have not yet occurred. Thus, for example, a joint  and 50-percent survivor annuity will be treated as a series of  substantially equal payments at the time payments commence, as will a  joint and survivor annuity that provides for increased payments to the  employee if the employee's beneficiary dies before the employee.  Similarly, for purposes of determining if a disability benefit payment  is part of a series of substantially equal payments for a period  described in section 402(c)(4)(A), any contingency under which payments  cease upon recovery from the disability may be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain supplements disregarded. For purposes of determining  whether a distribution is one of a series of payments that are  substantially equal, social security supplements described in section  411(a)(9) are disregarded. For example, if a distributee receives a life  annuity of $500 per month, plus a social security supplement consisting  of payments of $200 per month until the distributee reaches the age at  which social security benefits of not less than $200 a month begin, the  $200 supplemental payments are disregarded and, therefore, each monthly  payment of $700 made before the social security age and each monthly  payment of $500 made after the social security age is treated as one of  a series of substantially equal periodic payments for life. A series of  payments that are not substantially equal solely because the amount of  each payment is reduced upon attainment of social security retirement  age (or, alternatively, upon commencement of social security early  retirement, survivor, or disability benefits) will also be treated as  substantially equal as long as the reduction in the actual payments is  level and does not exceed the applicable social security benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(4)(A)</em>. For  example, substantially equal periodic payments made under a life annuity  with a five-year term certain would not be an eligible rollover  distribution even when paid after the death of the employee with three  years remaining under the term certain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Defined contribution plans. The following rules apply in  determining whether a series of payments from a defined contribution  plan constitute substantially equal periodic payments for a period  described in section 402(c)(4)(A):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Declining balance of years. A series of payments from an account  balance under a defined contribution plan will be considered  substantially equal payments over a period if, for each year, the amount  of the distribution is calculated by dividing the account balance by the  number of years remaining in the period. For example, a series of  payments will be considered substantially equal payments over 10 years  if the series is determined as follows. In year 1, the annual payment is  the account balance divided by 10; in year 2, the annual payment is the  remaining account balance divided by 9; and so on until year 10 when the  entire remaining balance is distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable actuarial assumptions. If an employee's account  balance under a defined contribution plan is to be distributed in annual  installments of a specified amount until the account balance is  exhausted, then, for purposes of determining if the period of  distribution is a period described in section 402(c)(4)(A), the period  of years over which the installments will be distributed must be  determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions. For example, if an  employee has an account balance of $100,000, elects distributions of  $12,000 per year until the account balance is exhausted, and the future  rate of return is assumed to be 8% per year, the account balance will be  exhausted in approximately 14 years. Similarly, if the same employee  elects a fixed annual distribution amount and the fixed annual amount is  less than or equal to $10,000, it is reasonable to assume that a future  rate of return will be greater than 0% and, thus, the account will not  be exhausted in less than 10 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Series of payments beginning before January 1, 1993. Except as  provided in paragraph (c) of this Q&A;, if a series of periodic payments  began before January 1, 1993, the determination of whether the post- December 31, 1992 payments are a series of substantially equal periodic  payments over a specified period is made by taking into account all  payments made, including payments made before January 1, 1993. For  example, if a series of substantially equal periodic payments beginning  on January 1, 1983, is scheduled to be paid over a period of 15 years,  payments in the series that are made after December 31, 1992, will not  be eligible rollover distributions even though they will continue for  only five years after December 31, 1992, because the pre- January 1,  1993 payments are taken into account in determining the specified  period.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: What types of variations in the amount of a payment cause the  payment to be independent of a series of substantially equal periodic  payments and thus not part of the series?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) Independent payments. Except as provided in paragraph (b)  of this Q&A;, a payment is treated as independent of the payments in a  series of substantially equal payments, and thus not part of the series,  if the payment is substantially larger or smaller than the other  payments in the series. An independent payment is an eligible   rollover distribution if it is not otherwise excepted from the  definition of eligible rollover distribution. This is the case  regardless of whether the payment is made before, with, or after  payments in the series. For example, if an employee elects a single  payment of half of the account balance with the remainder of the account  balance paid over the life expectancy of the distributee, the single  payment is treated as independent of the payments in the series and is  an eligible rollover distribution unless otherwise excepted. Similarly,  if an employee's surviving spouse receives a survivor life annuity of  $1,000 per month plus a single payment on account of death of $7,500,  the single payment is treated as independent of the payments in the  annuity and is an eligible rollover distribution unless otherwise  excepted (e.g., $5,000 of the $7,500 might qualify to be excluded from  gross income as a death benefit under section 101(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Administrative error or delay. If, due solely  to reasonable administrative error or delay in payment, there is an  adjustment after the annuity starting date to the amount of any payment  in a series of payments that otherwise would constitute a series of  substantially equal payments described in section 402(c)(4)(A) and this  section, the adjusted payment or payments will be treated as part of the  series of substantially equal periodic payments and will not be treated  as independent of the payments in the series. For example, if, due  solely to reasonable administrative delay, the first payment of a life  annuity is delayed by two months and reflects an additional two months  worth of benefits, that payment will be treated as a substantially equal  payment in the series rather than as an independent payment. The result  will not change merely because the amount of the adjustment is paid in a  separate supplemental payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Supplemental payments for annuitants. A supplemental payment  from a defined benefit plan to annuitants (e.g., retirees or  beneficiaries) will be treated as part of a series of substantially  equal payments, rather than as an independent payment, provided that the  following conditions are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The supplement is a benefit increase for annuitants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the supplement is determined in a consistent  manner for all similarly situated annuitants;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The supplement is paid to annuitants who are otherwise  receiving payments that would constitute substantially equal periodic  payments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The aggregate supplement is less than or equal to the greater  of 10% of the annual rate of payment for the annuity, or $750 or any  higher amount prescribed by the Commissioner in revenue rulings,  notices, and other guidance published in the Federal Register. See Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Final payment in a series. If a payment in a series of payments  from an account balance under a defined contribution plan represents the  remaining balance to the credit and is substantially less than the other  payments in the series, the final payment must nevertheless be treated  as a payment in the series of substantially equal payments and may not  be treated as an independent payment if the other payments in the series  are substantially equal and the payments are for a period described in  section 402(c)(4)(A) based on the rules provided in paragraph (d)(2) of  Q&A-5; of this section. Thus, such final payment will not be an eligible  rollover distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: When is a distribution from a plan a required minimum  distribution under section 401(a)(9)?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: (a) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c)  of this Q&A;, if a minimum distribution is required for a calendar year,  the amounts distributed during that calendar year are treated as  required minimum distributions under section 401(a)(9), to the extent  that the total required minimum distribution under section 401(a)(9) for  the calendar year has not been satisfied. Accordingly, these amounts are  not eligible rollover distributions. For example, if an employee is  required under section 401(a)(9) to receive a required minimum  distribution for a calendar year of $5,000 and the employee receives a  total of $7,200 in that year, the first $5,000 distributed will be  treated as the required minimum distribution and will   not be an eligible rollover distribution and the remaining $2,200 will  be an eligible rollover distribution if it otherwise qualifies. If the  total section 401(a)(9) required minimum distribution for a calendar  year is not distributed in that calendar year (e.g., when the  distribution for the calendar year in which the employee reaches age  70\1/2\ is made on the following April 1), the amount that was required  but not distributed is added to the amount required to be distributed  for the next calendar year in determining the portion of any  distribution in the next calendar year that is a required minimum  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Distribution before age 70\1/2\. Any amount that is paid before  January 1 of the year in which the employee attains (or would have  attained) age 70\1/2\ will not be treated as required under section  401(a)(9) and, thus, is an eligible rollover distribution if it  otherwise qualifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rule for annuities. In the case of annuity payments from  a defined benefit plan, or under an annuity contract purchased from an  insurance company (including a qualified plan distributed annuity  contract (as defined in Q&A-10; of this section)), the entire amount of  any such annuity payment made on or after January 1 of the year in which  an employee attains (or would have attained) age 70\1/2\ will be treated  as an amount required under section 401(a)(9) and, thus, will not be an  eligible rollover distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: How are amounts that are not includible in gross income  allocated for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: If section 401(a)(9) has not yet been satisfied by the plan for  the year with respect to an employee, a distribution is made to the  employee that exceeds the amount required to satisfy section 401(a)(9)  for the year for the employee, and a portion of that distribution is  excludible from gross income, the following rule applies for purposes of  determining the amount of the distribution that is an eligible rollover  distribution. The portion of the distribution that is excludible from  gross income is first allocated toward satisfaction of section 401(a)(9)  and then the remaining portion of the required minimum distribution, if  any, is satisfied from the portion of the distribution that is  includible in gross income. For example, assume an employee is required  under section 401(a)(9) to receive a minimum distribution for a calendar  year of $4,000 and the employee receives a $4,800 distribution, of which  $1,000 is excludible from income as a return of basis. First, the $1,000  return of basis is allocated toward satisfying the required minimum  distribution. Then, the remaining $3,000 of the required minimum  distribution is satisfied from the $3,800 of the distribution that is  includible in gross income, so that the remaining balance of the  distribution, $800, is an eligible rollover distribution if it otherwise  qualifies.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: What is a distribution of a plan loan offset amount, and is it  an eligible rollover distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: (a) General rule. A distribution of a plan loan offset amount,  as defined in paragraph (b) of this Q&A;, is an eligible rollover  distribution if it satisfies Q&A-3; of this section. Thus, an amount  equal to the plan loan offset amount can be rolled over by the employee  (or spousal distributee) to an eligible retirement plan within the 60- day period under section 402(c)(3), unless the plan loan offset amount  fails to be an eligible rollover distribution for another reason. See  Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-16; for guidance concerning the offering of a  direct rollover of a plan loan offset amount. See Sec. 31.3405(c)-1,  Q&A-11; of this chapter for guidance concerning special withholding rules  with respect to plan loan offset amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of plan loan offset amount. For purposes of section  402(c), a distribution of a plan loan offset amount is a distribution  that occurs when, under the plan terms governing a plan loan, the  participant's accrued benefit is reduced (offset) in order to repay the  loan (including the enforcement of the plan's security interest in a  participant's accrued benefit). A distribution of a plan loan offset  amount can occur in a variety of circumstances, e.g., where the terms  governing a plan loan require that, in the event of the employee's  termination of employment or request for a distribution, the loan be  repaid immediately or   treated as in default. A distribution of a plan loan offset amount also  occurs when, under the terms governing the plan loan, the loan is  cancelled, accelerated, or treated as if it were in default (e.g., where  the plan treats a loan as in default upon an employee's termination of  employment or within a specified period thereafter). A distribution of a  plan loan offset amount is an actual distribution, not a deemed  distribution under section 72(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>-1, Q&A-11;  of this chapter are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In 1996, Employee A has an account balance of $10,000  in Plan Y, of which $3,000 is invested in a plan loan to Employee A that  is secured by Employee A's account balance in Plan Y. Employee A has  made no after-tax employee contributions to Plan Y. Plan Y does not  provide any direct rollover option with respect to plan loans. Upon  termination of employment in 1996, Employee A, who is under age 70\1/2\  , elects a distribution of Employee A's entire account balance in Plan  Y, and Employee A's outstanding loan is offset against the account  balance on distribution. Employee A elects a direct rollover of the  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In order to satisfy section 401(a)(31), Plan Y must pay $7,000  directly to the eligible retirement plan chosen by Employee A in a  direct rollover. When Employee A's account balance was offset by the  amount of the $3,000 unpaid loan balance, Employee A received a plan  loan offset amount (equivalent to $3,000) that is an eligible rollover  distribution. However, under Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-16; Plan Y  satisfies section 401(a)(31), even though a direct rollover option was  not provided with respect to the $3,000 plan loan offset amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  the terms governing the plan loan to Employee A provide that, upon  termination of employment, Employee A's account balance is automatically  offset by the amount of any unpaid loan balance to repay the loan.  Employee A terminates employment but does not request a distribution  from Plan Y. Nevertheless, pursuant to the terms governing the plan  loan, Employee A's account balance is automatically offset by the amount  of the $3,000 unpaid loan balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The $3,000 plan loan offset amount attributable to the plan loan  in this example is treated in the same manner as the $3,000 plan loan  offset amount in Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that,  instead of providing for an automatic offset upon termination of  employment to repay the plan loan, the terms governing the plan loan  require full repayment of the loan by Employee A within 30 days of  termination of employment. Employee A terminates employment, does not  elect a distribution from Plan Y, and also fails to repay the plan loan  within 30 days. The plan administrator of Plan Y declares the plan loan  to Employee A in default and executes on the loan by offsetting Employee  A's account balance by the amount of the $3,000 unpaid loan balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The $3,000 plan loan offset amount attributable to the plan loan  in this example is treated in the same manner as the $3,000 plan loan  offset amount in Example 1 and in Example 2. The result in this Example  3 is the same even though the plan administrator treats the loan as in  default before offsetting Employee A's accrued benefit by the amount of  the unpaid loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  Employee A elects to receive the distribution of the account balance  that remains after the $3,000 offset to repay the plan loan, instead of  electing a direct rollover of the remaining account balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In this case, the amount of the distribution received by  Employee A is $10,000, not $3,000. Because the amount of the $3,000  offset attributable to the loan is included in determining the amount  that equals 20 percent of the eligible rollover distribution received by  Employee A, withholding in the amount of $2,000 (20 percent of $10,000)  is required under section 3405(c). The $2,000 is required to be withheld  from the $7,000 to be distributed to Employee A in cash, so that  Employee A actually receives a check for $5,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the  $7,000 distribution to Employee A after the offset to repay the loan  consists solely of employer securities within the meaning of section  402(e)(4)(E). In this case, no withholding is required under section  3405(c) because the distribution consists solely of the $3,000 plan loan  offset amount and the $7,000 distribution of employer securities. This  is the result because the total amount required to be withheld does not  exceed the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property  distributed, excluding plan loan offset amounts and employer securities.  Employee A may roll over the employer securities and $3,000 to an   eligible retirement plan within the 60-day period provided in section  402(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Employee B, who is age 40, has an account balance in Plan  Z, a profit sharing plan qualified under section 401(a) that includes a  qualified cash or deferred arrangement described in section 401(k). Plan  Z provides for no after-tax employee contributions. In 1990, Employee B  receives a loan from Plan Z, the terms of which satisfy section  72(p)(2), and which is secured by elective contributions subject to the  distribution restrictions in section 401(k)(2)(B). In 1996, the loan  fails to satisfy section 72(p)(2) because Employee B stops repayment. In  that year, pursuant to section 72(p), Employee B is taxed on a deemed  distribution equal to the amount of the unpaid loan balance. Under Q&A-4;  of this section, the deemed distribution is not an eligible rollover  distribution. Because Employee B has not separated from service or  experienced any other event that permits the distribution under section  401(k)(2)(B) of the elective contributions that secure the loan, Plan Z  is prohibited from executing on the loan. Accordingly, Employee B's  account balance is not offset by the amount of the unpaid loan balance  at the time Employee B stops repayment on the loan. Thus, there is no  distribution of an offset amount that is an eligible rollover  distribution in 1996.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: What is a qualified plan distributed annuity contract, and is  an amount paid under such a contract a distribution of the balance to  the credit of the employee in a qualified plan for purposes of section  402(c)?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: (a) Definition of a qualified plan distributed annuity  contract. A qualified plan distributed annuity contract is an annuity  contract purchased for a participant, and distributed to the  participant, by a qualified plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of amounts paid as eligible rollover distributions.  Amounts paid under a qualified plan distributed annuity contract are  payments of the balance to the credit of the employee for purposes of  section 402(c) and are eligible rollover distributions, if they  otherwise qualify. Thus, for example, if the employee surrenders the  contract for a single sum payment of its cash surrender value, the  payment would be an eligible rollover distribution to the extent it is  includible in gross income and not a required minimum distribution under  section 401(a)(9). This rule applies even if the annuity contract is  distributed in connection with a plan termination. See Sec.  1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-17; and Sec. 31.3405(c)-1, Q&A-13; of this chapter  concerning the direct rollover requirements and 20-percent withholding  requirements, respectively, that apply to eligible rollover  distributions from such an annuity contract.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: If an eligible rollover distribution is paid to an employee,  and the employee contributes all or part of the eligible rollover  distribution to an eligible retirement plan within 60 days, is the  amount contributed not currently includible in gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: Yes, the amount contributed is not currently includible in  gross income, provided that it is contributed to the eligible retirement  plan no later than the 60th day following the day on which the employee  received the distribution. If more than one distribution is received by  an employee from a qualified plan during a taxable year, the 60-day rule  applies separately to each distribution. Because the amount withheld as  income tax under section 3405(c) is considered an amount distributed  under section 402(c), an amount equal to all or any portion of the  amount withheld can be contributed as a rollover to an eligible  retirement plan within the 60-day period, in addition to the net amount  of the eligible rollover distribution actually received by the employee.  However, if all or any portion of an amount equal to the amount withheld  is not contributed as a rollover, it is included in the employee's gross  income to the extent required under section 402(a), and also may be  subject to the 10-percent additional income tax under section 72(t). See  Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-14;, for guidance concerning the qualification  of a plan that accepts a rollover contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: How does section 402(c) apply to a distributee who is not the  employee?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: (a) Spousal distributee. If any distribution attributable to  an employee is paid to the employee's surviving spouse, section 402(c)  applies to the distribution in the same manner as if the spouse were the  employee. The same rule applies if any distribution attributable to an  employee is paid in accordance with a qualified domestic relations order  (as defined in section 414(p)) to the employee's spouse or former spouse  who is an alternate   payee. Therefore, a distribution to the surviving spouse of an employee  (or to a spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a  qualified domestic relations order), including a distribution of  ancillary death benefits attributable to the employee, is an eligible  rollover distribution if it meets the requirements of section 402(c)(2)  and (4) and Q&A-3; through Q&A-10; and Q&A-14; of this section. However, a  qualified plan (as defined in Q&A-2; of this section) is not treated as  an eligible retirement plan with respect to a surviving spouse. Only an  individual retirement plan is treated as an eligible retirement plan  with respect to an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Non-spousal distributee. A distributee other than the employee  or the employee's surviving spouse (or a spouse or former spouse who is  an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order) is not  permitted to roll over distributions from a qualified plan. Therefore,  those distributions do not constitute eligible rollover distributions  under section 402(c)(4) and are not subject to the 20-percent income tax  withholding under section 3405(c).</p><p class="depth0">Q-13: Must an employee's (or spousal distributee's) election to  treat a contribution of an eligible rollover distribution to an  individual retirement plan as a rollover contribution be irrevocable?</p><p class="depth0">A-13: (a) In general. Yes. In order for a contribution of an  eligible rollover distribution to an individual retirement plan to  constitute a rollover and, thus, to qualify for current exclusion from  gross income, a distributee must elect, at the time the contribution is  made, to treat the contribution as a rollover contribution. An election  is made by designating to the trustee, issuer, or custodian of the  eligible retirement plan that the contribution is a rollover  contribution. This election is irrevocable. Once any portion of an  eligible rollover distribution has been contributed to an individual  retirement plan and designated as a rollover distribution, taxation of  the withdrawal of the contribution from the individual retirement plan  is determined under section 408(d) rather than under section 402 or 403.  Therefore, the eligible rollover distribution is not eligible for  capital gains treatment, five-year or ten-year averaging, or the  exclusion from gross income for net unrealized appreciation on employer  stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Direct rollover. If an eligible rollover distribution is paid to  an individual retirement plan in a direct rollover at the election of  the distributee, the distributee is deemed to have irrevocably  designated that the direct rollover is a rollover contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14: How is the $5,000 death benefit exclusion under section 101(b)  treated for purposes of determining the amount that is an eligible  rollover distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-14: To the extent that a death benefit is a distribution from a  qualified plan, the portion of the distribution that is excluded from  gross income under section 101(b) is not an eligible rollover  distribution. See Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-18; for guidance concerning  assumptions that a plan administrator may make with respect to whether  and to what extent a distribution of a survivor benefit is excludible  from gross income under section 101(b).</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: May an employee (or spousal distributee) roll over more than  the plan administrator determines to be an eligible rollover  distribution using an assumption described in Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-; 18?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: Yes. The portion of any distribution that an employee (or  spousal distributee) may roll over as an eligible rollover distribution  under section 402(c) is determined based on the actual application of  section 402 and other relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  The actual application of these provisions may produce different results  than any assumption described in Sec. 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-18; that is  used by the plan administrator. Thus, for example, even though the plan  administrator calculates the portion of a distribution that is a  required minimum distribution (and thus is not made eligible for direct  rollover under section 401(a)(31)), by assuming that there is no  designated beneficiary, the portion of the distribution that is actually  a required minimum distribution and thus not an eligible rollover  distribution is determined by taking into account the   designated beneficiary, if any. If, by taking into account the  designated beneficiary, a greater portion of the distribution is an  eligible rollover distribution, the distributee may rollover the  additional amount. Similarly, even though a plan administrator assumes  that a distribution from a qualified plan is the only death benefit with  respect to an employee that qualifies for the $5,000 death benefit  exclusion under section 101(b), to the extent that the death benefit  exclusion is allocated to a different death benefit, a greater portion  of the distribution may actually be includible in gross income and,  thus, be an eligible rollover distribution, and the surviving spouse may  roll over the additional amount if it otherwise qualifies.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: Is a rollover from a qualified plan to an individual  retirement account or individual retirement annuity treated as a  rollover contribution for purposes of the one-year look-back rollover  limitation of section 408(d)(3)(B)?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: No. A distribution from a qualified plan that is rolled over  to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity is  not treated for purposes of section 408(d)(3)(B) as an amount received  by an individual from an individual retirement account or individual  retirement annuity which is not includible in gross income because of  the application of section 408(d)(3).

The fact that an employee may have been potentially  covered is not sufficient. Evidence that the employment was entered  into, or the agreement executed, ``as of'' a date before October 21,  1942, or that the agreement or trust instrument which did not  theretofore meet the requirements of section 402(d) was modified or  amended after October 20, 1942, so as to come within the provisions of  such section, will not satisfy the requirements of section 402(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That such contribution, pursuant to the terms of such agreement,  was to   be applied for the purchase of an annuity contract for the taxpayer.

However, such control will not be presumed from the fact  that the trustee is himself an officer or employee of the employer. As  used in section 402(d) the phrase ``if * * * under the terms of the  trust agreement the employee is not entitled'' means that the trust  instrument must make it impossible for the prohibited distribution to  occur whether by operation or natural termination of the trust, whether  by power of revocation or amendment, other than with the consent of the  trustee, whether by the happening of a contingency, by collateral  arrangement, or any other means. It is not essential that the employer  relinquish all power to modify or terminate the trust but it must be  impossible, except with the consent of the trustee, to be received by  the taxpayer contracts purchased by the trustee, or by the employer and  transferred to the trustee, to be received by the taxpayer directly or  indirectly, other than as annuity payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The nature and amount of such contribution and the extent to  which income taxes have been paid thereon before January 1, 1949, and  not credited or refunded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If it is claimed that section 402(d) applies to amounts  contributed to a trust after June 1, 1949, the taxpayer must prove to  the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the trust did not, on June 1,  1949, qualify for exemption under section 165(a) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939.

For plan years beginning before January 1,  1988, a plan, annuity contract, simplified employee pension, or trust  does not fail to meet the requirements of section 401(a), section  403(b), section 408(k), or section 501(c)(18), respectively, merely  because excess deferrals are made with respect to the plan, contract,  pension, or trust. For plan years beginning after December 3l, 1987, see  section 401(a)(30) and Sec. 1.401(a)-30 for the effect of excess  deferrals on the qualification of a plan or trust under section 401(a).  For purposes of determining whether a plan or trust complies in  operation with section 401(a)(30), excess deferrals that are distributed  under paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section are disregarded.

For  other purposes of the Code, including sections 401(a)(4), 401(k)(3),  404, 409, 411, 412, and 416, excess deferrals must be treated as  employer contributions even if they are distributed in accordance with  paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section. However, excess deferrals of a  nonhighly compensated employee are not taken into account under section  401(k)(3) (the actual deferral percentage test) to the extent the excess  deferrals are prohibited under section 401(a)(30). Excess deferrals are  also treated as employer contributions for purposes of section 415  unless distributed under paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Definition of excess deferrals. The term ``excess deferrals''  means the excess of an individual's elective deferrals for any taxable  year, as defined in Sec. 1.402(g)-1(b), over the applicable limit   under section 402(g)(1) for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Correction of excess deferrals after the taxable year. A plan  may provide that if any amount is an excess deferral under paragraph (a)  of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not later than the first April 15 (or such earlier date  specified in the plan) following the close of the individual's taxable  year, the individual may notify each plan under which elective deferrals  were made of the amount of the excess deferrals received by the plan. If  any designated Roth contributions were made to a plan, the notification  must also identify the extent, if any, to which the excess deferrals are  comprised of designated Roth contributions. A plan may provide that an  individual is deemed to have notified the plan of excess deferrals  (including the portion of excess deferrals that are comprised of  designated Roth contributions) to the extent the individual has excess  deferrals for the taxable year calculated by taking into account only  elective deferrals under the plan and other plans of the same employer  and the plan may provide the extent to which such excess deferrals are  comprised of designated Roth contributions. A plan may instead provide  that the employer may notify the plan on behalf of the individual under  these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not later than the first April 15 following the close of the  taxable year, the plan may distribute to the individual the amount  designated under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section (and any income  allocable to that amount).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Correction of excess deferrals during taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan  may provide that an individual who has excess deferrals for a taxable  year may receive a corrective distribution of excess deferrals during  the same year. This corrective distribution may be made only if all of  the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual designates the distribution as an excess  deferral. A plan may provide that an individual is deemed to have  designated the distribution to the extent the individual has excess  deferrals for the taxable year calculated by taking into account only  elective deferrals under the plan and other plans of the same employer.  If any designated Roth contributions were made to a plan, the  notification must identify the extent to which, if any, the excess  deferrals are comprised of designated Roth contributions. A plan may  provide that an individual is deemed to have notified the plan of excess  deferrals (including the portion of excess deferrals that are comprised  of designated Roth contributions) for the taxable year calculated by  taking into account only elective deferrals under the plan and other  plans of the same employer and the plan may provide the extent to which  such excess deferrals are comprised of designated Roth contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The correcting distribution is made after the date on which the  plan received the excess deferral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The plan designates the distribution as a distribution of excess  deferrals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (e)(3) are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. S is a 62 year old individual who participates in Employer  Y's qualified cash or deferred arrangement. In January 1991, S withdraws  $5,000 from Y's cash or deferred arrangement. From February through  September, S defers $900 per month. On October 1, S leaves Employer Y  and becomes employed by Employer Z (unrelated to Y). During the  remainder of 1991, S defers $1,800 under Z's qualified cash or deferred  arrangement. In January 1992, S realizes that S has deferred a total of  $9,000 in 1991, and therefore has a $525 excess deferral ($9,000 minus  $8,475, the applicable limit for 1991). An additional $525 must be  distributed to S before April 15, 1992, to correct the excess deferral.  The $5,000 withdrawal did not correct the excess deferral because it  occurred before the excess deferral was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plan provisions. In order to distribute excess deferrals  pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, a plan must  contain language permitting distribution of excess deferrals. A plan may  require the notification in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section  to be in writing and may require that the employee certify or otherwise  establish that the designated amount is an excess deferral. A plan need  not permit distribution of excess deferrals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Income allocable to excess deferrals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The  income allocable to excess deferrals for a taxable year that begins on  or after January 1, 2007 is equal to the sum of the allocable gain or  loss for the taxable year of the individual and, to the extent the  excess deferrals are or will be credited with gain or loss for the  period after the close of the taxable year and prior to the distribution  (the gap period) if the total account were to be distributed, the  allocable gain or loss during that period. The income allocable to  excess deferrals for a taxable year that begins before 2007 is  determined using the 1.402(g)-1(e)(5) (as it appeared in the April 1,  2006 edition of 26 CFR Part 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Method of allocating income. A plan may use any reasonable  method for computing the income allocable to excess deferrals, provided  that the method does not violate section 401(a)(4), is used consistently  for all participants and for all corrective distributions under a plan  for the plan year, and is used by the plan for allocating income to  participants' accounts. See Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(8). A plan will not  fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income allocable to  excess deferrals merely because the income allocable to excess deferrals  is determined on a date that is no more than 7 days before the  distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative method of allocating taxable year income. A plan  may determine the income allocable to excess deferrals for the taxable  year by multiplying the income for the taxable year allocable to  elective deferrals by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the  excess deferrals by the employee for the taxable year. The denominator  of the fraction is equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The total account balance of the employee attributable to  elective deferrals as of the beginning of the taxable year, plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The employee's elective deferrals for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Safe harbor method of allocating gap period income. Under the  safe harbor method, income on excess deferrals for the gap period is  equal to 10 percent of the income allocable to excess deferrals for the  taxable year (calculated under the method described in paragraph  (e)(5)(iii) of this section), multiplied by the number of calendar  months that have elapsed since the end of the taxable year. For purposes  of calculating the number of calendar months that have elapsed under the  safe harbor method, a corrective distribution that is made on or before  the fifteenth day of the month is treated as made on the last day of the  preceding month. A distribution made after the fifteenth day of the  month is treated as made on the first day of the next month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Alternative method for allocating taxable year and gap period  income. A plan may determine the allocable gain or loss for the  aggregate of the taxable year and the gap period by applying the  alternative method provided by paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section to  this aggregate period. This is accomplished by substituting the income  for the taxable year and the gap period for the income for the taxable  year and by substituting the elective deferrals for the taxable year and  the gap period for the elective deferrals for the taxable year in  determining the fraction that is multiplied by that income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>. See Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(4)(i). In  no case may an individual receive from a plan as a corrective  distribution for a taxable year under paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this  section an amount in excess of the individual's total elective deferrals  under the plan for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> No employee or spousal consent required. A corrective  distribution of excess deferrals (and income) may be made under the  terms of the plan without regard to any notice or consent   otherwise required under sections 411(a)(11) or 417.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Tax treatment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corrective distributions on or before April  15 after close of taxable year. A corrective distribution of excess  deferrals within the period described in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of  this section is excludable from the employee's gross income. However,  the income allocable to excess deferrals is includible in the employee's  gross income for the taxable year in which the allocable income is  distributed. The corrective distribution of excess deferrals (and  income) is not subject to the early distribution tax of section 72(t)  and is not treated as a distribution for purposes of applying the excise  tax under section 4980A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for 1987 and 1988 excess deferrals. Income on  excess deferrals for 1987 or 1988 that were timely distributed on or  before April 17, 1989, may be reported by the recipient either in the  year described in paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, or in the year in  which the employee would have received the elective deferrals had the  employee originally elected to receive the amounts in cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> are treated as employer contributions  for purposes of section 415 when they are contributed to the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Distributions of excess deferrals from a designated Roth  account. The rules of paragraph (e)(8)(iii) of this section generally  apply to distributions of excess deferrals that are designated Roth  contributions and the attributable income. Thus, if a designated Roth  account described in section 402A includes any excess deferrals, any  distribution of amounts attributable to those excess deferrals are  includible in gross income (without adjustment for any return of  investment in the contract under section 72(e)(8)). In addition, such  distributions cannot be qualified distributions described in section  402A(d)(2) and are not eligible rollover distributions within the  meaning of section 402(c)(4). For this purpose, if a designated Roth  account includes any excess deferrals, any distributions from the  account are treated as attributable to those excess deferrals until the  total amount distributed from the designated Roth account equals the  total of such deferrals and attributable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Partial correction. Any distribution under paragraphs (e)(2) or  (e)(3) of this section of less than the entire amount of excess  deferrals (and income) is treated as a pro rata distribution of excess  deferrals and income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by  the following examples. Assume in Examples 1 and 2 that there is no  income or loss allocable to the elective deferrals.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employee A is a 60-year old highly compensated employee  who participates in Employer M's cash or deferred arrangement. During  the period of January through September of 1988, A contributed $7,000 to  the arrangement in elective deferrals. During the same period A also  contributed $813 in elective deferrals under a plan of an unrelated  employer. In December of 1988, A made a withdrawal of $1,000 from  Employer M's plan but did not designate this as a withdrawal of an  excess deferral. In January of 1989, A notifies Employer M of an excess  deferral, specifying a distribution of $500 for 1988. To correct the  excess deferrals, A must receive this additional $500 even though A has  already withdrawn $1,000 for   1988. A may exclude from income in 1988 only $7,313. However, if the  $500 is distributed by April 25, 1989, the distribution is excludable  from A's gross income in 1989. Even if A withdraws the $500, M must take  into account the entire $7,000 in computing A's actual deferral  percentage for 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X maintains a cash or deferred  arrangement.

However, since B has already received a distribution of $2,002  to meet the ADP test, no additional amounts are required or are  permitted to be distributed as excess deferrals by this plan, and the  prior distribution of excess contributions has corrected the excess  deferrals. But X must report $2,000 as a distribution of an excess  deferral and $2 as a distribution of an excess contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employee T has excess deferrals of $1,000. The income  attributable to excess deferrals is $100. T properly notifies the  employer, and requests a distribution of the excess deferral (and  income) on February 1. The plan distributes $1,000 to T by April 15.  Because the plan did not distribute any additional amount as income,  $909 is treated as a distribution of excess deferrals, and $91 is  treated as a distribution of earnings. With respect to amounts remaining  in the account, $91 is treated as an elective deferral and is not  included in T's investment in the contract. Because it was not  distributed by the required date, the $91 is includible in gross income  upon distribution as well as in the year of deferral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Community property laws.

A designated Roth account is a separate account under a  qualified cash or deferred arrangement under a section 401(a) plan, or  under a section 403(b) plan, to which designated Roth contributions are  permitted to be made in lieu of elective contributions and that  satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.401(k)-1(f) (in the case of a  section 401(a) plan) or Sec. 1.403(b)-3(c) (in the case of a section  403(b) plan).</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. How is a distribution from a designated Roth account taxed?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. (a) The taxation of a distribution from a designated Roth  account depends on whether or not the distribution is a qualified  distribution.

See  A-11 of this section for other amounts that are not treated as qualified  distributions, including excess contributions described in section  401(k)(8), and excess aggregate contributions described in section  401(m)(8), and income, on any of these excess amounts.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. How is a distribution from a designated Roth account taxed if  it is not a qualified distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. Except as provided in A-11 of this section, a distribution from  a designated Roth account that is not a qualified distribution is  taxable to the distributee under section 402 in the case of a plan  qualified under section 401(a) and under section 403(b)(1) in the case  of a section 403(b) plan. For this purpose, a designated Roth account is  treated as a separate contract under section 72. Thus, except as  otherwise provided in A-5 of this section for a rollover, if a  distribution is before the annuity starting date, the portion of any  distribution that is includible in gross income as an amount allocable  to income on the contract and the portion not includible in gross income  as an amount allocable to investment in the contract is determined under  section 72(e)(8), treating the designated Roth account as a separate  contract. Similarly, in the case of any amount received as an annuity,  if a distribution is on or after the annuity starting date, the portion  of any annuity payment that is includible in gross income as an amount  allocable to income on the contract and the portion not includible in  gross income as an amount allocable to investment in the contract is  determined under section 72(b) or (d), as applicable, treating the  designated Roth account as a separate contract. For purposes of section  72, designated Roth contributions are described in section 72(f)(1) or  72(f)(2), to the extent applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. What is the 5-taxable-year period of participation described in  A-2 of this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. (a) The 5-taxable-year period of participation described in A-2  of this section for a plan is the period of 5 consecutive taxable years  that begins with the first day of the first taxable year in which the  employee makes a designated Roth contribution to any designated Roth  account established for the employee under the same plan and ends when 5  consecutive taxable years have been completed. For this purpose, the  first taxable year in which an employee makes a designated Roth  contribution is the year in which the amount is includible in the  employee's gross income. Notwithstanding the preceding, however, a  contribution that is returned as an excess deferral or excess  contribution does not begin the 5 taxable-year period of participation.  Similarly, a contribution returned as a permissible withdrawal under  section 414(w) does not begin the 5 taxable-year period of  participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Generally, an employee's 5-taxable-year period of participation  is determined separately for each plan (within the meaning of section  414(l)) in which the employee participates. Thus, if an employee has  elective deferrals made to designated Roth accounts under two or more  plans, the employee may have two or more different 5-taxable-year  periods of participation, depending on when the employee first had  contributions made to a designated Roth account under each plan.  However, if a direct rollover contribution of a distribution from a  designated Roth account under another plan is made by the employee to  the plan, the 5-taxable-year period of participation begins on the first  day of the employee's taxable year in which the employee first had  designated Roth contributions made to such other designated Roth  account, if earlier than the first taxable year in which a designated  Roth contribution is made to the plan. See A-5(c) of this section for  additional rules on determining the start of the 5-taxable-year of  participation in the case of an indirect rollover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The beginning of the 5-taxable-year period of participation is  not redetermined for any portion of an employee's designated Roth  account. This is true even if the entire designated Roth account is  distributed during the 5-taxable-year period of participation and the  employee subsequently makes additional designated Roth contributions  under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The rule in paragraph (c) of this section applies if the  employee dies or the account is divided pursuant to a qualified domestic  relations order (QDRO), and thus, a portion of the account is not  payable to the employee and is payable to the employee's beneficiary or  an alternate payee. In the case of distribution to an alternate payee or  beneficiary, generally, the age, death, or disability of the employee is  used to determine whether the distribution to an alternate payee or  beneficiary is qualified. However, if an alternate payee or a spousal  beneficiary rolls the distribution into a designated Roth account in a  plan maintained by his or her own employer, such individual's age,  disability, or death is used to determine whether a distribution from  the recipient plan is qualified. In addition, if the rollover is a  direct rollover contribution to the alternate payee's or spousal  beneficiary's own designated Roth account, the 5-taxable-year period of  participation under the recipient plan begins on the earlier of the date  the employee's 5-taxable-year period of participation began under the  distributing plan or the date the 5-taxable-year period of participation  applicable to the alternate payee's or spousal beneficiary's designated  Roth account began under the recipient plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If a designated Roth contribution is made by a reemployed  veteran for a year of qualified military service pursuant to section  414(u) that is before the year in which the contribution is actually  made, the contribution is treated as having been made in the year of  qualified military service to which the contribution relates, as  designated by the reemployed veteran. Reemployed veterans may identify  the year of qualified military service for which a contribution is made  for other purposes, such as for entitlement to a match, and the  treatment for the 5-taxable-year period of participation rule follows  that identification. In the absence of such designation, for purposes of  determining the first year of the five years of participation under  section 402A(d)(2)(B), the contribution is treated as relating to the  first year of qualified military service for which the reemployed  veteran could have made designated Roth contributions under the plan, or  if later the first taxable year in which designated Roth contributions  could be made under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. How do the taxation rules apply to a distribution from a  designated Roth account that is rolled over?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. (a) An eligible rollover distribution from a designated Roth  account is permitted to be rolled over into another designated Roth  account or a Roth IRA, and the amount rolled over is not currently  includible in gross income. In accordance with section 402(c)(2), to the  extent that a portion of a distribution from a designated Roth account  is not includible in income (determined without regard to the rollover),  if that portion of the distribution is to be rolled over into a  designated Roth account, the rollover must be accomplished through a  direct rollover (i.e., a 60-day rollover to another designated Roth  account is not available for this portion of the distribution). For this  purpose, any amount paid in a direct rollover is treated as a separate  distribution from any amount paid directly to the employee. If a  distribution from a designated Roth account is instead made to the  employee, the employee would still be able to roll over the entire  amount (or any portion thereof) into a Roth IRA within the 60-day period  described in section 402(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an eligible rollover distribution from a  designated Roth account that is not a qualified distribution and not  paid as a direct rollover contribution, if less than the entire amount  of the distribution is rolled over, the part that is rolled over is  deemed to consist first of the portion of the distribution that is  attributable to income under section 72(e)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If an employee receives a distribution from a designated Roth  account, the portion of the distribution that   would be includible in gross income is permitted to be rolled over into  a designated Roth account under another plan. In such a case, Sec.  1.402A-2, A-3, provides for additional reporting by the recipient plan.  In addition, the employee's period of participation under the  distributing plan is not carried over to the recipient plan for purposes  of satisfying the 5-taxable-year period of participation requirement  under the recipient plan. Generally, the taxable year in which the  recipient plan accepts such rollover contribution is the taxable year  that begins the participant's new 5-taxable-year period of  participation. However, if the participant is rolling over to a plan in  which the participant already has a pre-existing designated Roth account  with a longer period of participation, the starting date of the  recipient account is used to measure the participant's 5-taxable-year  period of participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The following example illustrates the application of this A-5:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Employee B receives a $14,000 eligible rollover  distribution that is not a qualified distribution from B's designated  Roth account, consisting of $11,000 of investment in the contract and  $3,000 of income. Within 60 days of receipt, Employee B rolls over  $7,000 of the distribution into a Roth IRA. The $7,000 is deemed to  consist of $3,000 of income and $4,000 of investment in the contract.  Because the only portion of the distribution that could be includible in  gross income (the income) is rolled over, none of the distribution is  includible in Employee B's gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> This A-5 applies for taxable years beginning on or after January  1, 2006.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. In the case of a rollover contribution to a designated Roth  account, how is the amount that is treated as investment in the contract  under section 72 determined?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. (a) If a distribution from a designated Roth account is rolled  over to another designated Roth account in a direct rollover, the amount  of the rollover contribution allocated to investment in the contract in  the recipient designated Roth account is the amount that would not have  been includible in gross income (determined without regard to section  402(e)(4)) if the distribution had not been rolled over. Thus, if an  amount that is a qualified distribution is rolled over, the entire  amount of the rollover contribution is allocated to investment in the  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the entire account balance of a designated Roth account is  rolled over to another designated Roth account in a direct rollover,  and, at the time of the distribution, the investment in the contract  exceeds the balance in the designated Roth account, the investment in  the contract in the distributing plan is included in the investment in  the contract of the recipient plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7. After a qualified distribution from a designated Roth account  has been made, how is the remaining investment in the contract of the  designated Roth account determined under section 72?</p><p class="depth0">A-7. (a) The portion of any qualified distribution that is treated  as a recovery of investment in the contract is determined in the same  manner as if the distribution were not a qualified distribution. (See A- 3 of this section) Thus, the remaining investment in the contract in a  designated Roth account after a qualified distribution is determined in  the same manner after a qualified distribution as it would be determined  if the distribution were not a qualified distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following example illustrates the application of this A-7:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Employee C receives a $12,000 distribution, which is a  qualified distribution that is attributable to the employee being  disabled within the meaning of section 72(m)(7), from C's designated  Roth account. Immediately prior to the distribution, the account  consisted of $21,850 of investment in the contract (i.e., designated  Roth contributions) and $1,150 of income. For purposes of determining  recovery of investment in the contract under section 72, the  distribution is deemed to consist of $11,400 of investment in the  contract [$12,000 x 21,850/(1,150 + 21,850)], and $600 of income  [$12,000 x 1,150/(1,150 + 21,850)]. Immediately after the distribution,  C's designated Roth account consists of $10,450 of investment in the  contract and $550 of income. This determination of the remaining  investment in the contract will be needed if C subsequently is no longer  disabled and takes a nonqualified distribution from the designated Roth  account.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8. What is the relationship between the accounting for designated  Roth contributions as investment in the contract for purposes of section  72 and their treatment as elective deferrals   available for a hardship distribution under section 401(k)(2)(B)?</p><p class="depth0">A-8. (a) There is no relationship between the accounting for  designated Roth contributions as investment in the contract for purposes  of section 72 and their treatment as elective deferrals available for a  hardship distribution under section 401(k)(2)(B). A plan that makes a  hardship distribution under section 401(k)(2)(B) from elective deferrals  that includes designated Roth contributions must separately determine  the amount of elective deferrals available for hardship and the amount  of investment in the contract attributable to designated Roth  contributions for purposes of section 72. Thus, the entire amount of a  hardship distribution is treated as reducing the otherwise maximum  distributable amount for purposes of applying the rule in section  401(k)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(ii) that generally limits  hardship distributions to the principal amount of elective deferrals  made less the amount of elective deferrals previously distributed from  the plan, even if a portion of the distribution is treated as income  under section 72(e)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following example illustrates the application of this A-8:</p><p class="depth0">Example. The facts are the same as in the Example in A-7 of this  section, except that instead of being disabled, Employee C is receiving  a hardship distribution. In addition, Employee C has made elective  deferrals that are not designated Roth contributions totaling $20,000  and has received no previous distributions of elective deferrals from  the plan. The adjustment to the investment in the contract is the same  as in A-7 of this section, but for purposes of determining the amount of  elective deferrals available for future hardship distribution, the  entire amount of the distribution is subtracted from the maximum  distributable amount. Thus, Employee C has only $29,850 ($41,850- $12,000) available for hardship distribution from C's designated Roth  account.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9. Can an employee have more than one separate contract for  designated Roth contributions under a plan qualified under section  401(a) or a section 403(b) plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-9. (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this A-9,  for purposes of section 72, there is only one separate contract for an  employee with respect to the designated Roth contributions under a plan.  Thus, if a plan maintains one separate account for designated Roth  contributions made under the plan and another separate account for  rollover contributions received from a designated Roth account under  another plan (so that the rollover account is not required to be subject  to the distribution restrictions otherwise applicable to the account  consisting of designated Roth contributions made under the plan), both  separate accounts are considered to be one contract for purposes of  applying section 72 to the distributions from either account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a separate account with respect to an employee's accrued  benefit consisting of designated Roth contributions is established and  maintained for an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic  relations order and another designated Roth account is maintained for  the employee, each account is treated as a separate contract for  purposes of section 72. The alternate payee's designated Roth account is  also a separate contract for purposes of section 72 with respect to any  other account maintained for that alternate payee. Similarly, if  separate accounts are established and maintained for different  beneficiaries after the death of an employee, the separate account for  each beneficiary is treated as a separate contract under section 72 and  is also a separate contract with respect to any other account maintained  for that beneficiary under the plan that is not a designated Roth  account. When the separate account is established for an alternate payee  or for a beneficiary (after an employee's death), each separate account  must receive a proportionate amount attributable to investment in the  contract.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10. What is the tax treatment of employer securities distributed  from a designated Roth account?</p><p class="depth0">A-10. (a) If a distribution of employer securities from a designated  Roth account is not a qualified distribution, section 402(e)(4)(B)  applies. Thus, in the case of a lump-sum distribution that includes  employer securities, unless the taxpayer elects otherwise, net  unrealized appreciation attributable to   the employer securities is not includible in gross income; and such net  unrealized appreciation is not included in the basis of the distributed  securities and is capital gain to the extent such appreciation is  realized in a subsequent taxable transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a qualified distribution of employer securities  from a designated Roth account, the distributee's basis in the  distributed securities for purposes of subsequent disposition is their  fair market value at the time of distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11. Can an amount described in A-4 of Sec. 1.402(c)-2 with  respect to a designated Roth account be a qualified distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-11. No. An amount described in A-4 of Sec. 1.402(c)-2 with  respect to a designated Roth account cannot be a qualified distribution.  Such an amount is taxable under the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.72-16(b),  1.72(p)-1, A-11 through A-13, 1.402(g)-1(e)(8), 1.401(k)-2(b)(2)(vi),  1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(vi), or 1.404(k)-1T. Thus, for example, loans that are  treated as deemed distributions pursuant to section 72(p), or dividends  paid on employer securities as described in section 404(k) are not  qualified distributions even if the deemed distributions occur or the  dividends are paid after the employee attains age 59\1/2\ and the 5- taxable-year period of participation defined in A-4 of this section has  been satisfied. However, if a dividend is reinvested in accordance with  section 404(k)(2)(A)(iii)(II), the amount of such a dividend is not  precluded from being a qualified distribution if later distributed.  Further, an amount is not precluded from being a qualified distribution  merely because it is described in section 402(c)(4) as an amount not  eligible for rollover. Thus, a hardship distribution is not precluded  from being a qualified distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12. If any amount from a designated Roth account is included in a  loan to an employee, do the plan aggregation rules of section  72(p)(2)(D) apply for purposes of determining the total amount an  employee is permitted to borrow from the plan, even though the  designated Roth account generally is treated as a separate contract  under section 72?</p><p class="depth0">A-12. Yes. If any amount from a designated Roth account is included  in a loan to an employee, notwithstanding the general rule that the  designated Roth account is treated as a separate contract under section  72, the plan aggregation rules of section 72(p)(2)(D) apply for purposes  of determining the maximum amount the employee is permitted to borrow  from the plan and such amount is based on the total of the designated  Roth contribution amounts and the other amounts under the plan. To the  extent a loan is from a designated Roth account, the repayment  requirement of section 72(p)(2)(C) must be satisfied separately with  respect to that portion of the loan and with respect to the portion of  the loan from other accounts under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13. Does a transaction or accounting methodology involving an  employee's designated Roth account and any other accounts under the plan  or plans of an employer that has the effect of transferring value from  the other accounts into the designated Roth account violate the separate  accounting requirement of section 402A?</p><p class="depth0">A-13. (a) Yes. Any transaction or accounting methodology involving  an employee's designated Roth account and any other accounts under the  plan or plans of an employer that has the effect of directly or  indirectly transferring value from another account into the designated  Roth account violates the separate accounting requirement under section  402A. However, any transaction that merely exchanges investments between  accounts at fair market value will not violate the separate accounting  requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an annuity contract which contains both a  designated Roth account and any other accounts, the Commissioner may  prescribe additional guidance of general applicability, published in the  Internal Revenue Bulletin (see 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), to  provide additional rules for allocation of income, expenses, gains and  losses among the accounts under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> This A-13 applies to designated Roth accounts for taxable years  beginning on or after January 1, 2006.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14. How is an annuity contract that is distributed from a  designated   Roth account treated for purposes of section 402A?</p><p class="depth0">A-14. A qualified plan distributed annuity contract within the  meaning of Sec. 1.402(c)-2, A-10(a) that is distributed from a  designated Roth account is not treated as a distribution for purposes of  section 402 or 402A. Instead, the amounts paid under the annuity  contract are treated as distributions for purposes of sections 402 and  402A. Thus, the period after the annuity contract is distributed and  before a payment from the annuity contract is made is included in  determining whether the five-year period of participation is satisfied.  Further, for purposes of determining if a distribution is a qualified  distribution, the determination of whether a distribution is made on or  after the date the employee attains age 59\1/2\, made to a beneficiary  or the estate of the employee on or after the employee's death, or  attributable to the employee's being disabled within the meaning of  section 72(m)(7) is made based on the facts at the time the distribution  is made from the annuity contract. Thus for example, if an employee  first makes a designated Roth contribution to a designated Roth account  in 2006 at age 56, receives a distributed annuity contract within the  meaning of Sec. 1.402(c)-2, A-10(a) in 2007 purchased only with assets  from the designated Roth account, and then receives a distribution from  the contract in 2011 at age 60, the distribution is a qualified  distribution.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15.

Thus, if an employee receives two contracts on  separation from the service and surrenders one of them in the year of  separation and receives payments under the other until his death, the  capital gains treatment is applicable to the balance paid to his  beneficiary on his death if paid within one taxable year of the  beneficiary. The amount received by the employee on surrender of the  contract in the year of his separation from the service, however, would  not receive capital gains treatment since the balance to the credit of  the employee with respect to all amounts under the plan did not become  payable at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an employee retires and commences to receive an annuity but  subsequently in some succeeding taxable year, he is paid a lump sum in  settlement of all future annuity payments, the capital gains treatment  does not apply to such lump sum settlement paid during the lifetime of  the employee since it is not a payment on account of separation from the  service, or death after separation, but is on account of the settlement  of future annuity payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the ``total amounts'' payable under all annuity contracts  under the plan with respect to a particular employee are paid or  includible in the gross income of several payees within one taxable year  on account of the employee's death or other separation from the service  or on account of his death after separation from the service, the  capital gains treatment is applicable. Thus, if the balance to the  credit of a deceased employee under all annuity contracts provided under  an annuity plan becomes payable to two payees, the capital gains  treatment is applicable provided the ``total amounts'' payable are  received by or includible in the gross income of both payees within the  same taxable year. However, if the ``total amounts'' payable are made  available to each payee and one elects to receive his share in cash  while the other makes a timely election under section 72(h) to receive  his share as an annuity, the capital gains treatment does not apply to  either payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of determining whether the total amounts payable to  an employee have been paid within one taxable year, the term ``total  amounts'' includes amounts under a plan which are attributable to  contributions on behalf of an individual while he was self-employed in  the business with respect to which the plan was established. Thus, the  ``total amounts'' payable are not paid within one taxable year if  amounts remain payable which are so attributable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The term ``total amounts'' does not include any amount which has  been placed in a separate account for the funding of benefits described  in section 401(h). Thus, a distribution under a qualified annuity plan  may constitute a distribution of the total amounts payable with respect  to an employee even though amounts attributable to the funding of  section 401(h) medical benefits as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.401-14 are not so distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em> organization or a public school.</p><p class="depth0">This section lists the headings that appear in Sec.

In  addition, section 403(b)(5) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section provide  that, for purposes of determining whether a contract satisfies section  403(b), all section 403(b) contracts purchased for an individual by an  employer are treated as purchased under a single contract. Thus, except  as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or as otherwise provided  in this paragraph (d), a failure to satisfy section 403(b) with respect  to any contract issued to an individual by an employer adversely affects  all contracts issued to that individual by that employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a failure  to operate in accordance with the terms of a plan adversely affects all  of the contracts issued by the employer to the employee or employees  with respect to whom the operational failure occurred.

However, any failure that is not an operational  failure adversely affects all contracts issued under the plan,  including: a failure to have contracts issued pursuant to a written  defined contribution plan which, in form, satisfies the requirements of  Sec. 1.403(b)-1, Sec. 1.403(b)-2, this section, and Sec.

See Sec. 1.403(b)-8(d)(4) for a rule  under which a custodial account that fails to satisfy the  nonforfeitability requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is  treated as a section 401(a) qualified plan for certain purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment when contract becomes nonforfeitable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, on or after the  date on which the participant's interest in a contract described in  paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section becomes nonforfeitable, the contract  may be treated as a section 403(b) contract if no election has been made  under section 83(b) with respect to the contract, the participant's  interest in the contract has been subject to a substantial risk of  forfeiture (as defined in section 83) before becoming nonforfeitable,  each contribution under the contract that is subject to a different  vesting schedule is maintained in a separate account, and the contract  has at all times satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this  section other than the nonforfeitability requirement of paragraph (a)(2)  of this section. Thus, for example, for the current year and each prior  year, no contribution can have been made to the contract that would  cause the contract to fail to be a section 403(b) contract as a result  of contributions exceeding the limitations of section 415 (except to the  extent permitted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) or to fail to  satisfy the nondiscrimination rules described in Sec. 1.403(b)-5.

For purposes of applying this paragraph (d), if  only a portion of a participant's interest in a contract becomes  nonforfeitable in a year, then the portion that is nonforfeitable and  the portion that fails to be nonforfeitable are each treated as separate  contracts. In addition, for purposes of applying this paragraph (d), if  a contribution is made to an annuity contract in excess of the  limitations of section 415(c) and the excess is maintained in a separate  account, then the portion of the contract that includes the excess  contributions account and the remainder are each treated as separate  contracts. Thus, if an annuity contract that includes an excess  contributions account changes from forfeitable to nonforfeitable during  a year, then the portion that is not attributable to the excess  contributions account constitutes a section 403(b) contract (assuming it  otherwise satisfies the requirements to be a section 403(b) contract)  and is not included in gross income, and the portion that is  attributable to the excess contributions account is included in gross  income in accordance with section 403(c).

Thus, D cannot make section  403(b) elective deferrals in excess of D's actual compensation, which is  $14,000, even though the basic dollar limit exceeds that amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts illustrating calculation of the special  section 403(b) catch-up. For 2006, employee E, who is age 53, is  eligible to participate in a section 403(b) plan of hospital H, which is  a section 501(c)(3) organization. H's plan permits section 403(b)  elective deferrals and provides for an employer contribution of 10  percent of a participant's compensation. The plan provides limitations  on section 403(b) elective deferrals up to the maximum permitted under  paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. For 2006, E's  includible compensation is $50,000. E wishes to elect to have the  maximum section 403(b) elective deferral possible contributed in 2006. E  has previously made $62,000 of section 403(b) elective deferrals under  the plan, but has never made an election for a special section 403(b)  catch-up elective deferral.

The limitation on the  additional special section 403(b) catch-up amount is not less than  $3,000 because the limitation at paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section  is $15,000 ($15,000 minus zero) and the limitation at paragraph  (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section is $13,000 ($5,000 times 15, minus $62,000  of total deferrals in prior years). These conclusions would be  unaffected if H were an eligible governmental employer under section  457(b) that has a section 457(b) eligible governmental plan and E were  in the past to have made annual deferrals to that plan, because  contributions to a section 457(b) eligible governmental plan do not  constitute elective deferrals; and these conclusions would also be the  same if H had a section 401(k) plan and E were in the past to have made  elective deferrals to that plan, assuming that those elective deferrals  did not exceed $10,000 ($5,000 times 15, minus the sum of $62,000 plus  $10,000, equals $3,000), so as to   result in the limitation at paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section being  less than $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(C)</em> of  this section. For 2007, the basic dollar limit for section 403(b)  elective deferrals under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is assumed to  be $16,000, the additional dollar amount permitted under the age 50  catch-up is assumed to be $5,000, and E's employer contributes $6,000  (10% of $60,000) as a non-elective contribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The maximum section 403(b) elective deferral that D  may elect under H's section 403(b) plan for 2007 is $21,000. This is the  sum of the basic limit on section 403(b) elective deferrals under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section equal to $16,000, plus the additional  age 50 catch-up amount of $5,000. E is not entitled to any additional  special section 403(b) catch-up amount for 2007 under paragraph (c)(3)  of this section due to the limitation at paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this  section (16 times $5,000 equals $80,000, minus D's total prior section  403(b) elective deferrals of $80,000 equals zero).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Employer contributions for former employees--(1) Includible  compensation deemed to continue for nonelective contributions. For  purposes of applying paragraph (b) of this section, a former employee is  deemed to have monthly includible compensation for the period through  the end of the taxable year of the employee in which he or she ceases to  be an employee and through the end of each of the next five taxable  years. The amount of the monthly includible compensation is equal to one  twelfth of the former employee's includible compensation during the  former employee's most recent year of service. Accordingly, nonelective  employer contributions for a former employee must not exceed the  limitation of section 415(c)(1) up to the lesser of the dollar amount in  section 415(c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> or the former employee's annual includible  compensation based on the former employee's average monthly compensation  during his or her most recent year of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Private college M is a section 501(c)(3)  organization operated on the basis of a June 30 fiscal year that  maintains a section 403(b) plan for its employees. In 2004, M amends the  plan to provide for a temporary early retirement incentive under which  the college will make a nonelective contribution for any participant who  satisfies certain minimum age and service conditions and who retires  before June 30, 2006. The contribution will equal 110 percent of the  participant's rate of pay for one year and will be payable over a period  ending no later than the end of the fifth fiscal year that begins after  retirement. It is assumed for purposes of this Example 1 that, in  accordance with Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-10(b) and under the facts and  circumstances, the post-retirement contributions made for participants  who satisfy the minimum age and service conditions and retire before  June 30, 2006, do not discriminate in favor of former employees who are  highly compensated employees. Employee A retires under the early  retirement incentive on March 12, 2006, and A's annual includible  compensation for the period from March 1, 2005, through February 28,  2006 (which is A's most recent one year of service) is $30,000. The  applicable dollar limit under section 415(c)(1)(A) is assumed to be  $44,000 for 2006 and $45,000 for 2007. The college contributes $30,000  for A for 2006 and $3,000 for A for 2007 (totaling $33,000 or 110  percent of $30,000). No other contributions are made to a section 403(b)  contract for A for those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The contributions made for A do not exceed A's  includible compensation for 2006 or 2007.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Private college N is a section 501(c)(3)  organization that maintains a section 403(b) plan for its employees. The  plan provides for N to make monthly nonelective contributions equal to  20 percent of the monthly includible compensation for each eligible  employee. In addition, the plan provides for contributions to continue  for 5 years following the retirement of any employee after age 64 and  completion of at least 20 years of service (based on the employee's  average annual rate of base salary in the preceding 3 calendar years  ended before the date of retirement). It is assumed for purposes of this  Example 2 that, in accordance with   Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-10(b) and under the facts and circumstances, the post- retirement contributions made for participants who satisfy the minimum  age and service conditions do not discriminate in favor of former  employees who are highly compensated employees. Employee B retires on  July 1, 2006, at age 64 after completion of 20 or more years of service.  At that date, B's annual includible compensation for the most recently  ended fiscal year of N is $72,000 and B's average monthly rate of base  salary for 2003 through 2005 is $5,000. N contributes $1,200 per month  (20 percent of 1/12th of $72,000) from January of 2006 through June of  2006 and contributes $1,000 (20 percent of $5,000) per month for B from  July of 2006 through June of 2011. The applicable dollar limit under  section 415(c)(1)(A) is $44,000 for 2006 through 2011. No other  contributions are made to a section 403(b) contract for B for those  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The contributions made for B do not exceed B's  includible compensation for any of the years from 2006 through 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A public university maintains a section 403(b)  under which it contributes annually 10% of compensation for  participants, including for the first 5 calendar years following the  date on which the participant ceases to be an employee.

A $600 contribution  is made for C for January of the first taxable year following retirement  (10% of individual C's monthly includible compensation of $6,000).  Individual C dies during February of that year. The university makes a  contribution for individual C for February equal to $11,400 (C's monthly  includible compensation for January and February, reduced by $600).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conclusion. The contribution does not exceed the amount of  individual C's includible compensation for the taxable year for purposes  of section 415(c), but any additional contributions would exceed C's  includible compensation for purposes of section 415(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(C)</em> which sets  forth a special rule under which compensation may be treated as  continuing for purposes of section 415 for certain former employees who  are disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for determining years of service--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  For purposes of determining a participant's includible compensation  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and a participant's years of  service under paragraphs (c)(3) (special section 403(b) catch-up for  qualified employees of certain organizations) and (d) (employer  contributions for former employees) of this section, an employee must be  credited with a full year of service for each year during which the  individual is a full-time employee of the eligible employer for the  entire work period, and a fraction of a year for each part of a work  period during which the individual is a full-time or part-time employee  of the eligible employer. An individual's number of years of service  equals the aggregate of the annual work periods during which the  individual is employed by the eligible employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Work period. A year of service is based on the employer's annual  work period, not the employee's taxable year. For example, in  determining whether a university professor is employed full time, the  annual work period is the school's academic year. However, in no case  may an employee accumulate more than one year of service in a twelve- month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Service with more than one eligible employer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.  With respect to any section 403(b) contract of an eligible employer,  except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, any period  during which an individual is not an employee of that eligible employer  is disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for church employees. With respect to any section  403(b) contract of an eligible employer that is a church-related  organization, any period during which an individual is an employee of  that eligible employer and any other eligible employer that is a church- related organization that has an association (as defined in section  414(e)(3)(D)) with that eligible employer is taken into account on an  aggregated basis, but any period during which an individual is not an  employee of a church-related organization or is   an employee of a church-related organization that does not have an  association with that eligible employer is disregarded for purposes of  this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Full-time employee for full year. Each annual work period during  which an individual is employed full time by the eligible employer  constitutes one year of service. In determining whether an individual is  employed full-time, the amount of work which he or she actually performs  is compared with the amount of work that is normally required of  individuals performing similar services from which substantially all of  their annual compensation is derived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other employees. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An individual is treated as performing a  fraction of a year of service for each annual work period during which  he or she is a full-time employee for part of the annual work period and  for each annual work period during which he or she is a part-time  employee either for the entire annual work period or for a part of the  annual work period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the fraction that represents the fractional year  of service for an individual employed full time for part of an annual  work period, the numerator is the period of time (such as weeks or  months) during which the individual is a full-time employee during that  annual work period, and the denominator is the period of time that is  the annual work period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining the fraction that represents the fractional  year of service of an individual who is employed part time for the  entire annual work period, the numerator is the amount of work performed  by the individual, and the denominator is the amount of work normally  required of individuals who perform similar services and who are  employed full time for the entire annual work period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In determining the fraction representing the fractional year of  service of an individual who is employed part time for part of an annual  work period, the fractional year of service that would apply if the  individual were a part-time employee for a full annual work period is  multiplied by the fractional year of service that would apply if the  individual were a full-time employee for the part of an annual work  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Work performed. For purposes of this paragraph (e), in measuring  the amount of work of an individual performing particular services, the  work performed is determined based on the individual's hours of service  (as defined under section 410(a)(3)(C)), except that a plan may use a  different measure of work if appropriate under the facts and  circumstances. For example, a plan may provide for a university  professor's work to be measured by the number of courses taught during  an annual work period in any case in which that individual's work  assignment is generally based on a specified number of courses to be  taught.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Most recent one-year period of service. For purposes of  paragraph (d) of this section, in the case of a part-time employee or a  full-time employee who is employed for only part of the year determined  on the basis of the employer's annual work period, the employee's most  recent periods of service are aggregated to determine his or her most  recent one-year period of service. In such a case, there is first taken  into account his or her service during the annual work period for which  the last year of service's includible compensation is being determined;  then there is taken into account his or her service during his or her  next preceding annual work period based on whole months; and so forth  until the employee's service equals, in the aggregate, one year of  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Less than one year of service considered as one year. If, at the  close of a taxable year, an employee has, after application of all of  the other rules in this paragraph (e), some portion of one year of  service (but has accumulated less than one year of service), the  employee is deemed to have one year of service. Except as provided in  the previous sentence, fractional years of service are not rounded up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual G is employed half-time in 2004 and  2005 as a clerk by H, a hospital which is a section 501(c)(3)  organization. G earns $20,000 from H in each   of those years, and retires on December 31, 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For purposes of determining G's includible  compensation during G's last year of service under paragraph (d) of this  section, G's most recent periods of service are aggregated to determine  G's most recent one-year period of service. In this case, since D worked  half-time in 2004 and 2005, the compensation D earned in those two years  are aggregated to produce D's includible compensation for D's last full  year in service. Thus, in this case, the $20,000 that D earned in 2004  and 2005 for D's half-time work are aggregated, so that D has $40,000 of  includible compensation for D's most recent one-year of service for  purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(3), and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual H is employed as a part-time  professor by public University U during the first semester of its two- semester 2004-2005 academic year. While H teaches one course generally  for 3 hours a week during the first semester of the academic year, U's  full-time faculty members generally teach for 9 hours a week during the  full academic year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For purposes of calculating how much of a year of  service H performs in the 2004-2005 academic year (before application of  the special rules of paragraphs (e)(7) and (8) of this section  concerning less than one year of service), paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this  section is applied as follows: since H teaches one course at U for 3  hours per week for 1 semester and other faculty members at U teach 9  hours per week for 2 semesters, H is considered to have completed \3/18\  or \1/6\ of a year of service during the 2004-2005 academic year,  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fractional year of service if H were a part-time employee  for a full year is 3/9 (number of hours employed divided by the usual  number of hours of work required for that position).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The fractional year of service if H were a full-time employee  for half of a year is \1/2\ (one semester, divided by the usual 2- semester annual work period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> These fractions are multiplied to obtain the fractional year of  service: \3/9\ times \1/2\, or \3/18\, equals \1/6\ of a year of  service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Excess contributions or deferrals--(1) Inclusion in gross  income. Any contribution made for a participant to a section 403(b)  contract for the taxable year that exceeds either the maximum annual  contribution limit set forth in paragraph (b) of this section or the  maximum annual section 403(b) elective deferral limit set forth in  paragraph (c) of this section constitutes an excess contribution that is  included in gross income for that taxable year.

Distributions attributable to the pre-'87 account balance are  treated as satisfying the incidental benefit requirement if all  distributions from the section 403(b) contract (including distributions  attributable to both the pre-'87 account balance and the post-'86  account balance) satisfy the rules of this paragraph (e) (without regard  to this paragraph (e)(6)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Application to multiple contracts for an employee. The required  minimum distribution must be separately determined for each section  403(b) contract of an employee. However, because, as provided in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the distribution rules in section  401(a)(9) apply to section 403(b) contracts in accordance with the  provisions in Sec. 1.408-8, the required minimum distribution from one  section 403(b) contract of an employee is permitted to be distributed  from another section 403(b) contract in order to satisfy section  401(a)(9). Thus, as provided in Sec. 1.408-8, A-9, with respect to  IRAs, the required minimum distribution amount from each contract is  then totaled and the total minimum distribution taken from any one or  more of the individual section 403(b) contracts. However, consistent  with the rules in Sec. 1.408-8, A-9, only amounts in section 403(b)  contracts that an individual holds as an employee may be aggregated.  Amounts in section 403(b) contracts that an individual holds as a  beneficiary of the same decedent may be aggregated, but such amounts may  not be aggregated with amounts held in section 403(b) contracts that the  individual holds as the employee or as the beneficiary of another  decedent.

The determination of whether the availability of a loan,  the making of a loan, or a failure to repay a loan made from an issuer  of a section 403(b) contract to a participant or beneficiary is treated  as a distribution (directly or indirectly) for purposes of this section,  and the determination of whether the availability of the loan, the  making of the loan, or a failure to repay the loan is in any other  respect a violation of the requirements of section 403(b) and Sec. Sec.  1.403(b)-1 through 1.403(b)-5, this section, and Sec. Sec. 1.403(b)-7  through 1.403(b)-11, depends on the facts and circumstances. Among the  facts and circumstances are whether the loan has a fixed repayment  schedule and bears a reasonable rate of interest, and whether there are  repayment safeguards to which a prudent lender would adhere. Thus, for  example, a loan must bear a reasonable rate of interest in order to be  treated as not being a distribution. However, a plan loan offset is a  distribution for purposes of this section. See Sec. 1.72(p)-1, Q&A-13.;  See also Sec. 1.403(b)-7(d) relating to the application of section  72(p) with respect to the taxation of a loan made under a section 403(b)  contract.

In  addition, if a contract issued by an insurance company qualified to  issue annuities in a State includes provisions under which, in the event  a participant becomes disabled, benefits will be provided by the  insurance carrier as if employer contributions were continued until  benefit distribution commences, then that benefit is treated as an  incidental benefit (as insurance for a deferred annuity benefit in the  event of disability) that must satisfy the incidental benefit  requirement of Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(ii) (taking into account any other  incidental benefits provided under the plan). The rules of Sec.  1.402(a)-1(e) apply for purposes of determining when certain incidental  benefits are treated as distributed and included in gross income. See  Sec.

In  accordance with sections 402(c), 403(b)(8), and 403(b)(10), a direct  rollover in accordance with section 401(a)(31) is not includible in the  gross income of a participant or beneficiary in the year rolled over. In  addition, any payment made in the form of an eligible rollover  distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4)) is not includible in  gross income in the year paid to the extent the payment is contributed  to an eligible retirement plan (as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B))  within 60 days, including the contribution to the eligible retirement  plan of any property distributed. For this purpose, the rules of section  402(c)(2) through (7) and (c)(9) apply. Thus, to the extent that a  portion of a distribution (including a distribution from a designated  Roth account) would be excluded from gross income if it were not rolled  over, if that portion of the distribution is to be rolled over into an  eligible retirement plan that is not an IRA, the rollover must be  accomplished through a direct rollover of the entire distribution to a  plan qualified under section 401(a) or a section 403(b) plan and that  plan must agree to separately account for the amount not includible in  income (so   that a 60-day rollover to a plan qualified under section 401(a) or  another section 403(b) plan is not available for this portion of the  distribution).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, the payor of the  eligible rollover distribution from the contract is treated as the plan  administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Requirement that contract payor provide notice of rollover  option to distributees. To ensure that the distributee of an eligible  rollover distribution from a section 403(b) contract has a meaningful  right to elect a direct rollover, section 402(f) requires that the  distributee be informed of the option. Thus, within a reasonable time  period before making the initial eligible rollover distribution, the  payor must provide an explanation to the distributee of his or her right  to elect a direct rollover and the income tax withholding consequences  of not electing a direct rollover. For purposes of satisfying the  reasonable time period requirement, the plan timing rule provided in  section 402(f)(1) and Sec. 1.402(f)-1 applies to section 403(b)  contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mandatory withholding upon certain eligible rollover  distributions from contracts.

In accordance with  section 72(p), the amount of any loan from a section 403(b) contract to  a participant or beneficiary (including any pledge or assignment treated  as a loan under section 72(p)(1)(B)) is treated as having been received  as a distribution from the contract under section 72(p)(1), except to  the extent set forth in section 72(p)(2) (relating to loans that do not  exceed a maximum amount and that are repayable in accordance with  certain terms) and Sec. 1.72(p)-1.

A deemed  distribution is not an actual distribution for purposes of Sec.  1.403(b)-6, as provided at   Sec. 1.72(p)-1, Q&A-12; and Q&A-13.; (Further, see section 408(b)(1) of  title I of ERISA concerning the effect of noncompliance with title I  loan requirements for plans that are subject to title I of ERISA.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules relating to distributions from a designated Roth  account.

Thus, the  designated Roth account is treated as a separate contract for purposes  of section 72. For example, the rules of section 72(b) must be applied  separately to annuity payments with respect to a designated Roth account  under a section 403(b) plan and separately to annuity payments with  respect to amounts attributable to any other contributions to the  section 403(b) plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Aggregation of contracts.

It is immaterial whether the plan covers present employees  only, or present and former employees, or only former employees. Section  404(a) also governs the deductibility of unfunded pensions and death  benefits paid directly to former employees or their beneficiaries (see  Sec. 1.404(a)-12). For taxable years beginning after 1962, certain  self-employed individuals may be covered by pension, annuity, or profit- sharing plans. For the rules relating to the deduction of contributions  on behalf of such individuals, see paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.404(a)-8  and Sec. 1.404(e)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 404(a) does not apply to a plan which does not defer the  receipt of compensation. Furthermore, section 404(a) does not apply to  deductions for contributions under a plan which is solely a dismissal  wage or unemployment benefit plan, or a sickness, accident,  hospitalization, medical expense, recreation, welfare, or similar  benefit plan, or a combination thereof. For example, if under a plan an  employer contributes 5 percent of each employee's compensation per month  to a fund out of which employees who are laid off will be paid benefits  for temporary periods, but employees who are not laid off have no rights  to the funds, such a plan is an unemployment benefit plan, and the  deductibility of the contributions to it is determined under section  162. As to the deductibility of such contributions, see Sec. 1.162-9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If, however, the contributions to a pension, profit-sharing,  stock bonus, or other plan of deferred compensation can be used to  provide any of the benefits referred to in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph, then, except as provided in section 404(c), section 404(a)  applies to the entire contribution to the plan. Thus, if in the example  described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the employer's  contribution   on behalf of each employee is set up as a separate account, and if any  amount which remains in an employee's account at the time of retirement  is paid to him at such time, the deductibility of the contributions to  the plan is determined under section 404(a). For the regulations for  determining whether the benefits referred to in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph can be included in a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan,  see Sec. 1.401-1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> As to inclusion of full-time life insurance salesmen within the  class of persons considered to be employees, see section 7701(a)(20).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In order to be deductible under section 404(a), contributions  must be expenses which would be deductible under section 162 (relating  to trade or business expenses) or 212 (relating to expenses for  production of income) if it were not for the provision in section 404(a)  that they are deductible, if at all, only under section 404(a).  Contributions may therefore be deducted under section 404(a) only to the  extent that they are ordinary and necessary expenses during the taxable  year in carrying on the trade or business or for the production of  income and are compensation for personal services actually rendered. In  no case is a deduction allowable under section 404(a) for the amount of  any contribution for the benefit of an employee in excess of the amount  which, together with other deductions allowed for compensation for such  employee's services, constitutes a reasonable allowance for compensation  for the services actually rendered. What constitutes a reasonable  allowance depends upon the facts in the particular case. Among the  elements to be considered in determining this are the personal services  actually rendered in prior years as well as the current year and all  compensation and contributions paid to or for such employee in prior  years as well as in the current year. Thus, a contribution which is in  the nature of additional compensation for services performed in prior  years may be deductible, even if the total of such contributions and  other compensation for the current year would be in excess of reasonable  compensation for services performed in the current year, provided that  such total plus all compensation and contributions paid to or for such  employee in prior years represents a reasonable allowance for all  services rendered by the employee by the end of the current year. A  contribution under a plan which is primarily for the benefit of  shareholders of the employer is not deductible. Such a contribution may  constitute a dividend within the meaning of section 316. See also  Sec. Sec. 1.162-6 and 1.162-8. In addition to the limitations referred  to above, deductions under section 404(a) are also subject to further  conditions and limitations particularly provided therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deductions under section 404(a) are generally allowable only for  the year in which the contribution or compensation is paid, regardless  of the fact that the taxpayer may make his returns on the accrual method  of accounting. Exceptions are made in the case of overpayments as  provided in paragraphs (1), (3), and (7) of section 404(a), and, as  provided by section 404(a)(6), in the case of payments made by a  taxpayer on the accrual method of accounting not later than the time  prescribed by law for filing the return for the taxable year of accrual  (including extensions thereof). This latter provision is intended to  permit a taxpayer on the accrual method to deduct such accrued  contribution or compensation in the year of accrual, provided payment is  actually made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the  return for the taxable year of accrual (including extensions thereof),  but this provision is not applicable unless, during the taxable year on  account of which the contribution is made, the taxpayer incurs a  liability to make the contribution, the amount of which is accruable  under section 461 for such taxable year. See section 461 and the  regulations thereunder. There is another exception in the case of  certain taxpayers who are required to make additional contributions as a  result of the Act of June 15, 1955 (Public Law 74, 84th Cong., 69 Stat.  134), and the regulations thereunder.

See section 404(b) and Sec. 1.404(b)-1T.  Section 404 (a) and (d) requires that such a contribution or  compensation be paid or incurred for purposes of section 162 or 212 and  satisfy the requirements for deductibility under either of those  sections. However, notwithstanding the above, section 404 does not apply  to contributions paid or accrued with respect to a ``welfare benefit  fund'' (as defined in section 419(e)) after July 18, 1984, in taxable  years of employers (and payors) ending after that date.

The effect of treating the amendment as having also been made  to section 404(a)(8)(C) is to increase the amount of contributions on  behalf of a self-employed individual that will be treated as satisfying  section 162 or 212. Generally, therefore, a contribution on behalf of a  self-employed individual is treated as satisfying section 162 or 212 if  it is not in excess of the individual's earned income for the year,  determined without regard to the deduction allowed by section 404 for  the self-employed individual's contribution.

A  deduction is allowable for a contribution paid after August 1, 1969,  under section 404(a)(5) only in the taxable year of the employer in  which or with which ends the taxable year of an employee in which an  amount attributable to such contribution is includible in his gross  income as compensation, and then only to the extent allowable under  section 404(a).

For purposes of this </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, a contribution is  considered to be so includible where the employee or his beneficiary  excludes it from his gross income under section 101(b) or subchapter N.

In the case of a funded plan under which more than one employee  participates, no deduction is allowable under section 404(a)(5) for any  contribution unless separate accounts are maintained for each employee.  The requirement of separate accounts does not require that a separate  trust be maintained for each employee. However, a separate account must  be maintained for each employee to which employer contributions under  the plan are allocated, along with any income earned thereon. In  addition,   such accounts must be sufficiently separate and independent to qualify  as separate shares under section 663(c). Nothing shall preclude a trust  which loses its exemption under section 501(a) from setting up such  acounts and meeting the separate account requirement of section  404(a)(5) with respect to the taxable years in which such accounts are  set up and maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contributions paid on or before August 1, 1969.

See Sec. 1.404(a)-1. If payments are made under such a  plan and the amounts are not deductible under the other paragraphs of  section 404(a), they are deductible under section 404(a)(5) to the  extent that the rights of individual employees to, or derived from, such  employer's contribution or such compensation are nonforfeitable at the  time the contribution or compensation is paid. If unfunded pensions are  paid directly to former employees, their rights to such payments are  nonforfeitable, and accordingly, such amounts are deductible under  section 404(a)(5) when paid. Similarly, if amounts are paid as a death  benefit to the beneficiaries of an employee (for example, by continuing  his salary for a reasonable period), and if such amounts meet the  requirements of section 162 or 212, such amounts are deductible under  section 404(a)(5) in any case where they are not deductible under the  other paragraphs of section 404(a). As to what constitutes  nonforfeitable rights of an employee in other cases, see Sec. 1.402(b)- 1(d)(2). If an amount is accrued but not paid during the taxable year,  no deduction is allowable for such amount for such year. If an amount is  paid during the taxable year to a trust or under a plan and the  employee's rights to such amount are forfeitable at the time the amount  is paid, no deduction is allowable for such amount for any taxable year.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11689, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6534, 26 FR  517, Jan. 20, 1961]    Sec. 1.404(a)-14  Special rules in connection with the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(A)</em> of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for defined benefit plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 404(a). The term ``old section 404(a)'' means section  404(a) as in effect on September 1, 1974. Any reference to section 404  without the designation ``old'' is a reference to section 404 as amended  by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ten-year amortization base. The term ``10-year amortization  base'' means either the past service and other supplementary pension and  annuity credits described in section 404(a)(1)(A)(iii) or any base  established in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. A plan may  have several 10-year amortization bases to reflect different plan  amendments, changes in actuarial assumptions, changes in funding method,  and experience gains and losses of previous years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limit adjustment. The term ``limit adjustment'' with respect to  any 10-year amortization base is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The level annual amount necessary to amortize the base over 10  years using the valuation rate, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The unamortized balance of the base,    in each case using absolute values (solely for the purpose of  determining which is the lesser). To compute the level amortization  amount, the base may be divided by the present value of an annuity of  one dollar, obtained from standard annuity tables on the basis of a  given interest rate (the valuation rate) and a known period (the  amortization period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Absolute value. The term ``absolute value'' for any number is  the value of that number, treating negative numbers as if they were  positive numbers. For example, the absolute value of 5 is 5 and the  absolute value of minus 3 is 3. On the other hand, the true value of  minus 3 is minus 3. This term is relevant to the computation of the  limit adjustment described in paragraph (b)(3) and the remaining  amortization period of combined bases described in paragraph (i)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Valuation rate. The term ``valuation rate'' means the assumed  interest rate used to value plan liabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use of plan in determining deductible limit for employer's  taxable year. Although the deductible limit applies for an employer's  taxable year, the deductible limit is determined on the basis of a plan  year. If the employer's taxable year coincides with the plan year, the  deductible limit for the taxable year is the deductible limit for the  plan year that coincides with that year. If the employer's taxable year  does not coincide with the plan year, the deductible limit under section  404(a)(1)(A) (i), (ii), or (iii) for a given taxable year of the  employer is one of the following alternatives:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The deductible limit determined for the plan year commencing  within the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The deductible limit determined for the plan year ending within  the taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A weighted average of alternatives (1) and (2). Such an average  may be based, for example, upon the number of months of each plan year  falling within the taxable year.  The employer must use the same alternative for each taxable year unless  consent to change is obtained from the Commissioner under section 446  (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Computation of deductible limit for a plan year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General  rules. The computation of the deductible limit for a plan year is based  on the funding methods, actuarial assumptions, and benefit structure  used for purposes of section 412, determined without regard to section  412(g) (relating to the alternative minimum funding standard), for the  plan year. The method of valuing assets for purposes of section 404 must  be the same method of valuing assets used for purposes of section 412.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special adjustments of computations under section 412. To apply  the rules of this section (i.e., rules regarding the computation of  normal cost with aggregate type funding methods, unfunded liabilities,  and the full funding limitation described in paragraph (k) of the  section, where applicable) with respect to a given plan year in  computing deductible limits under section 404 (a)(1)(A), the following  adjustments must be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There must be excluded from the total assets of the plan the  amount of any plan contribution for a plan year for which the plan was  qualified under section 401(a), 403(a) or 405(a) that has not been  previously deducted, even though that amount may have been credited to  the funding standard account under section 412(b)(3). In the case of a  plan using a spread gain funding method which maintains an unfunded  liability (e.g., the frozen initial liability method, but not the  aggregate method), the amount described in the preceding sentence must  be included in the unfunded liability of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section apply on a year-by-year basis for purposes of section  404(a)(1)(A) only. Thus, the adjustments have no effect   on the computation of the minimum funding requirement under section 412.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special computation rules under section 404(a)(1)(A)(i)--(1) In  general. For purposes of determining the deductible limit under section  404(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)(i)</em>, the deductible limit with respect to a plan year is the  sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount required to satisfy the minimum funding standard of  section 412(a) (determined without regard to section 412(g)) for the  plan year and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An amount equal to the includible employer contributions. The  term ``includible employer contributions'' means employer contributions  which were required by section 412 for the plan year immediately  preceding such plan year, and which were not deductible under section  404(a) for the prior taxable year of the employer solely because they  were not contributed during the prior taxable year (determine with  regard to section 404(a)(6)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> applies if the minimum funding requirements for the  plan are determined under the alternative minimum funding standard  described in section 412(g) for both the current plan year and the  immediately preceding plan year. In that case, the deductible limit  under section 404(a)(1)(A)(i) (regarding the minimum funding requirement  of section 412) for the current year is the sum of the amount determined  under the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plus the charge under section 412(b)(2)(D), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Less the credit under section 412(b)(3)(D),  that would be required if in the current plan year the use of the  alternative method were discontinued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Special computation rules under section 404(a)(1)(A) (ii) and  (iii)--(1) In general. Subject to the full funding limitation described  in paragraph (k) of this section, the deductible limit under section  404(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)(ii)</em> and (iii) is the normal cost of the plan (determined in  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Adjustments in calculating limit under section 404  (a)(1)(A)(iii). In calculating the deductible limit under section  404(a)(1)(A)(iii), the normal cost of the plan is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Decreased by the limit adjustments to any unamortized bases  required by paragraph (g) of this section, for example, bases that are  due to a net experience gain, a change in actuarial assumptions, a  change in funding method, or a plan provision or amendment which  decreases the accrued liability of the plan, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Increased by the limit adjustments of any unamortized 10-year  amortization bases required by paragraph (g) or (j) of this section, for  example, bases that are due to a net experience loss, a change in  actuarial assumptions, a change in funding method, or a plan provision  or amendment which increases the accrued liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing for computations and interest adjustments under section  404(a)(1)(A) (ii) and (iii). Regardless of the actual time when  contributions are made to a plan, in computing the deductible limit  under section 404(a)(1)(A) (ii) and (iii) the normal cost and limit  adjustments shall be computed as of the date when contributions are  assumed to be made (``the computation date'') and adjusted for interest  at the valuation rate from the computation date to the earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The last day of the plan year used to compute the deductible  limit for the taxable year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The last day of that taxable year. For additional provisions  relating to the timing of computations and interest adjustments, see  paragraph (h)(6) of this section (relating to the timing of computations  and interest adjustments in the maintenance of 10-year amortization  bases). For taxable years beginning before April 22, 1981, computations  under the preceding sentence may, as an alternative, be based on prior  published positions of the Internal Revenue Service under section  404(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special limit under section 404(a)(1)(A)(ii). If the deduction  for the plan year is determined solely on the basis of section  404(a)(1)(A)(ii) (that is, without regard to clauses (i) or (iii)), the  special limitation contained in section 404(a)(1)(A)(ii), regarding the  unfunded cost with respect to any three individuals, applies,  notwithstanding   the rules contained in paragraphs (d)(2) and (f)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Establishment of a 10-year amortization base--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Experience  gains and losses. In the case of a plan valued by the use of a funding  method which is an immediate gain type of funding method (and therefore  separately amortizes rather than includes experience gains and losses as  a part of the normal cost of the plan), a 10-year amortization base must  be established in any plan year equal to the net experience gain or loss  required under section 412 to be determined with respect to that plan  year. The base is to be maintained in accordance with paragraph (h) of  this section. Such a base must not be established if the deductible  limit is determined by use of a funding method which is a spread gain  type of funding method (under which experience gains and losses are  spread over future periods as a part of the plan's normal cost).  Examples of the immediate gain type of funding method are the unit  credit method, entry age normal cost method, and the individual level  premium cost method. Examples of the spread gain type of funding method  are the aggregate cost method, frozen initial liability cost method, and  the attained age normal cost method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change in actuarial assumptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the creation of an  amortization base is required under the rules of section 412(b)  (2)(B)(v) or (3)(B)(iii) (as applied to the funding method used by the  plan), a 10-year amortization base must be established at the time of a  change in actuarial assumptions used to value plan liabilities. The  amount of the base is the difference between the accrued liability  calculated on the basis of the new assumptions and the accrued liability  calculated on the basis of the old assumptions. Both computations of  accrued liability are made as of the date of the change in assumptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A plan using a funding method of the spread gain type does not  directly determine an accrued liability. If a plan using such a method  is required under section 412(b) (2)(B)(v) or (3)(B)(iii) to create an  amortization base, it must establish a base as described in paragraph  (g)(2)(i) of this section for a change in actuarial assumptions by  determining an accrued liability on the basis of another funding method  (of the immediate gain type) that does determine an accrued liability.  (The aggregate method is an example of a funding method that is not  required under section 412(b) (2)(B)(v) or (3)(B)(iii) to create an  amortization base.) The funding method chosen to determine the accrued  liability of the plan in these cases must be the same method used to  establish all other 10-year amortization bases maintained by the plan,  if any. These bases must be maintained in accordance with paragraph (h)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(B)(i)</em> (as applied to the funding method used by  the plan). The amount of the base is the accrued liability arising from,  or the decrease in accrued liability resulting from, the establishment  or amendment of the plan. The base must be maintained in accordance with  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Change in funding method. If a change in funding method results  in an increase or decrease in an unfunded liability required to be  amortized under section 412, a 10-year base must be established equal to  the increase or decrease in unfunded liability resulting from the change  in funding method. The base must be maintained in accordance with  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Maintenance of 10-year amortization base--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Each  time a 10-year amortization base is established, whether by a change in  funding method, by plan amendment, by change in actuarial assumptions,  or by experience gains and losses, the base must, except as provided in  paragraph (i) of this section, be separately maintained in order to  determine when the unamortized amount of the base is zero. The sum of  the unamortized balances of all of the 10-year bases must equal the  plan's unfunded liability with the adjustments described in paragraph  (d) of this section, if applicable. When the unamortized amount of a  base is zero, the deductible limit is no longer   adjusted to reflect the amortization of the base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> First year's base. See either paragraph (g) or paragraph (i) of  this section for rules applicable with respect to the first year of a  base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Succeeding year's base. For any plan year after the first year  of a base, the unamortized amount of the base is equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The unamortized amount of the base as of the valuation date in  the prior plan year, plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest at the valuation rate from the valuation date in the  prior plan year to the valuation date in the current plan year on the  amount described in subdivision (i), minus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section  with respect to the base for the prior plan year.  The valuation date is the date as of which plan liabilities are valued  under section 412(c)(9). If such a valuation is performed less often  than annually for purposes of section 412, bases must be adjusted for  purposes of section 404 each year as of the date on which a section 412  valuation would be performed were it required on an annual basis. See  paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the definition of valuation rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contribution allocation with respect to each base. A portion of  the total contribution for the prior plan year is allocated to each  base. Generally, this portion equals the product of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total contribution described in paragraph (h)(6) of this  section with respect to all bases, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ratio of the amount described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of  this section with respect to the base to the sum (using true rather than  absolute values) of such amounts with respect to all remaining bases.  However, if the result of this computation with respect to a particular  base exceeds the amount necessary to amortize such base fully, the  smaller amount shall be deemed the contribution made with respect to  such base. The unallocated excess with respect to a now fully amortized  base shall be allocated among the other bases as indicated above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other allocation methods. The Commissioner may authorize the use  of methods other than the method described in paragraph (h)(4) of this  section for allocating contributions to bases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Total contribution for all bases. The contribution with respect  to all bases for the prior plan year (see paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this  section) is the difference between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sum of (A) the total deduction (including a carryover  deduction) for the prior year, (B) interest on the actual contributions  for the prior year (whether or not deductible) at the valuation rate for  the period between the dates as of which the contributions are credited  under section 412 and the valuation date in the current plan year, and  (C) interest on the carryover described in section 404(a)(1)(D) that is  available at the beginning of the prior taxable year at the valuation  rate for the period between the current and prior valuation dates, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The normal cost for the prior plan year and interest on it at  the valuation rate from the date as of which the normal cost is  calculated to the current valuation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Effect of failure to contribute normal cost plus interest on  unamortized amounts. The failure to make a contribution at least equal  to the sum of the normal cost plus interest on the unamortized amounts  has the following effects under the preceding rules of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It does not create a new base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It results in an increase in the unamortized amount of each  base and consequently extends the time before the base is fully  amortized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The limit adjustment for any base is not increased (in  absolute terms) even if the unamortized amount computed under paragraph  (h) of this section exceeds the initial 10-year amortization base. Thus,  if the total unamortized amount of the plan's bases at the beginning of  the plan year is $100,000 (which is also the unfunded liability of the  plan), and a required $50,000 normal cost contribution is not made for  the plan year, the following effects occur. The total unamortized  balance of the plan's bases increases by the $50,000 normal cost for the  year (adjusted for interest), plus interest on the $100,000 balance of  the bases; and,   because of that increase, it will take a longer period to amortize the  remaining balance of the bases. (The annual amortization amount does not  change.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Required adjustment to a 10-year base limit adjustment if  valuation rate changed. If there is a change in the valuation rate, the  limit adjustment for all unamortized 10-year amortization bases must be  changed, in addition to establishing a new base as provided in paragraph  (g)(2) of this section. The new limit adjustment for any base is the  level amount necessary to amortize the unamortized amount of the base  over the remaining amortization period using the new valuation rate. The  remaining amortization period of the base is the number of years at the  end of which the unamortized amount of the base would be zero if the  contribution made with respect to that base equaled the limit adjustment  each year. This calculation of the remaining period is made on the basis  of the valuation rate used before the change. Both the remaining  amortization period and the revised limit adjustment may be determined  through the use of standard annuity tables. The remaining period may be  computed in terms of fractional years, or it may be rounded off to a  full year. The unamortized amount of the base as of the valuation date  and the remaining amortization period of that base shall not be changed  by any change in the valuation rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Combining bases--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General method. For purposes of section 404  only, and not for purposes of section 412, different 10-year  amortization bases may be combined into a single 10-year amortization  base if such single base satisfies all of the requirements of paragraph  (i) (2), (3), and (4) of this section at the time of the combining of  the different bases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unamortized amount. The unamortized amount of the single base  equals the sum, as of the date the combination is made, of the  unamortized amount of the bases being combined (treating negative bases  as having negative unamortized amounts).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, the remaining  amortization period of each base being combined is that number of years  at the end of which the unamortized amount of the base would be zero if  the contribution made with respect to that base equaled the limit  adjustment of that base in each year. This number may be determined  through the use of standard annuity tables. The remaining amortization  period described in this paragraph may be computed in terms of  fractional years, or it may be rounded off to a whole year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limit adjustment. The limit adjustment for the single base is  the level amount necessary to amortize the unamortized amount of the  combined base over the remaining amortization period described in  paragraph (i)(3) of this section, using the valuation rate. This amount  may be determined through the use of standard annuity tables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fresh start alternative. In lieu of combining different 10-year  amortization bases, a plan may replace all existing bases with one new  10-year amortization base equal to the unfunded liability of the plan as  of the time the new base is being established. This unfunded liability  must be determined in accordance with the general rules of paragraphs  (d) and (f) of this section. The unamortized amount of the base and the  limit adjustment for the base will be determined as though the base were  newly established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Initial 10-year amortization base for existing plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. In the case of a plan in existence before the effective date of  section 404(a), the 10-year amortization base on the effective date of  section 404(a) is the sum of all 10 percent bases existing immediately  before section 404(a) became effective for the plan, determined under  the rules of old section 404(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limit adjustment. The limit adjustment for the initial base is  the lesser of the unamortized amount of such base or the sum of the  amounts determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section   using the original balances of the remaining bases (under old section  404(a) rules) as the amount to be amortized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unamortized amount. The employer may choose either to establish  a single initial base reflecting both all prior 10-percent bases and the  experience gain or loss for the immediately preceding actuarial period,  or to establish a separate base for the prior 10-percent bases and  another for the experience gain or loss for the immediately preceding  period. If the initial 10-year amortization base reflects the net  experience gain or loss from the immediately preceding actuarial period,  the unamortized amount of the initial base shall equal the total  unfunded liability on the effective date of section 404(a) determined in  accordance with the general rules of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this  section. If, however, a separate base will be used to reflect that gain  or loss, the unamortized amount of the initial base shall equal such  unfunded liability on the effective date of section 404(a), reduced by  the net experience loss or increased by the net experience gain for the  immediately preceding actuarial period. In this case, a separate 10-year  amortization base must be established on the effective date equal to the  net experience gain or loss. Thus, if the effective date unfunded  liability is $100,000 and an experience loss of $15,000 is recognized on  that date, and if the loss is to be treated as a separate base, the  unamortized balances of the two bases would be $85,000 and $15,000. If  the unfunded liability were the same $100,000, but a gain of $15,000  instead of a loss were recognized on that date, the unamortized balances  of the two bases would be $115,000 and a credit base of $15,000. In both  cases, if only one 10-year base is to be established on the effective  date, its unamortized balance would be $100,000 (the unfunded liability  of the plan). See paragraphs (d) and (f) for rules for determining the  unfunded liability of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effect of full funding limit on 10-year-amortization bases. The  amount deductible under section 404(a)(1)(A) (i), (ii), or (iii) for a  plan year may not exceed the full funding limitation for that year. See  section 412 and paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section for rules  to be used in the computation of the full funding limitation. If the  total deductible contribution (including carryover) for a plan year  equals or exceeds the full funding limitation for the year, all 10-year  amortization bases maintained by the plan will be considered fully  amortized, and the deductible limit for subsequent plan years will not  be adjusted to reflect the amortization of these bases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Transitional rules--(1) Plan years beginning before April 22,  1981.

In the case of a plan not in  existence on January 1, 1974, section 404(a) generally applies for  contributions on account of taxable years of an employer ending with or  within plan years beginning after September 4, 1974.

Thus, where a  corporation pays pensions to a retired employee or employees or to their  beneficiaries in such amounts as may be determined from time to time by  the board of directors or responsible officers of the company, or where  a corporation is under an obligation, whether funded or unfunded, to pay  a pension or other deferred compensation to an employee or his  beneficiaries, there is a method having the effect of a plan deferring  the receipt of compensation for which deductions are governed by section  404(a). If an employer on the accrual basis defers paying any  compensation to an employee until a later year or years under an  arrangement having the effect of a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing,  or annuity plan, or similar plan deferring the receipt of compensation,  he shall not be allowed a deduction until the year in which the  compensation is paid. This provision is not intended to cover the case  where an employer on the accrual basis defers payment of compensation  after the year of accrual merely because of inability to pay such  compensation in the year of accrual, as, for example, where the funds of  the company are not sufficient to enable payment of the compensation  without jeopardizing the solvency of the company, or where the liability  accrues in the earlier year, but the amount payable cannot be exactly  determined until the later year.

(Temporary)</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: As amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, what does section  404(b) of the Internal Revenue Code provide?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: As amended, section 404(b) clarifies that any plan, or method  or arrangement, deferring the receipt of compensation or providing for  deferred benefits (other than compensation) is to be treated as a plan  deferring the receipt of compensation for purposes of section 404 (a)  and (d). Accordingly, section 404 (a) and (d) (in the case of employees  and nonemployees; respectively) shall govern the deduction of  contributions paid or compensation paid or incurred with respect to such  a plan, or method or arrangement. Section 404 (a) and (d) requires that  such a contribution or compensation be paid or incurred for purposes of  section 162 or 212 and satisfy the requirements for deductibility under  either of those sections. Thus, for example, under section 404 (a)(5)  and (b), if otherwise deductible under section 162 or 212, a  contribution paid or incurred with respect to a nonqualified plan, or  method or arragement, providing for deferred benefits is deductible in  the taxable year of the employer in which or with which ends the taxable  year of the employee in which the amount attributable to the  contribution is includible in the gross income of the employee (without  regard to any applicable exclusion under Chapter 1, Subtitle A, of the  Internal Revenue Code). Section 404 (a) and (d) applies to all  compensation and   benefit plans, or methods or arrangements, however denominated, which  defer the receipt of any amount of compensation or benefit, including  fees or other payments. Thus, a limited partnership (using the accrual  method of accounting) may not accrue deductions for a fee owed to an  unrelated person (using the cash method of accounting) who performs  services for the partnership until the partnership taxable year in which  or with which ends the taxable year of the service provider in which the  fee is included in income. However, notwithstanding the above, section  404 does not apply to contributions paid or accrued with respect to a  ``welfare benefit fund'' (as defined in section 419(e)) after July 18,  1984, in taxable years of employers (and payors) ending after that date.  Also, section 463 shall govern the deduction of vacation pay by a  taxpayer that has elected the application of such section. For rules  relating to the deduction of contributions paid or accrued with respect  to a welfare benefit fund, see section 419, Sec. 1.419-1T and Sec.  1.419A-2T.

The determination of whether a  plan, or method or arrangement, defers the receipts of compensation or  benefits is made separately with respect to each employee and each  amount of compensation or benefit. Compensation or benefits received by  an employee's spouse or dependent or any other person, but taxable to  the employee, are treated as received by the employee for purposes of  section 404. An employee is determined to receive compensation or  benefits within or beyond a brief period of time after the end of the  employer's taxable year under the rules provided in this Q&A.; For the  treatment of expenses with respect to transactions between related  taxpayers, see section 267.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A plan, or method or arrangement, shall be presumed to be one  deferring the receipt of compensation for more than a brief period of  time after the end of an employer's taxable year to the extent that  compensation is received after the 15th day of the 3rd calendar month  after the end of the employer's taxable year in which the related  services are rendered (``the 2\1/2\ month period''). Thus, for example,  salary under an employment contract or a bonus under a year-end bonus  declaration is presumed to be paid under a plan, or method or  arrangement, deferring the receipt of compensation, to the extent that  the salary or bonus is received beyond the applicable 2\1/2\ month  period. Further, salary or a year-end bonus received beyond the  applicable 2\1/2\ month period by one employee shall be presumed to  constitute payment under a plan, or method or arrangement, deferring the  receipt of compensation for such employee even though salary or bonus  payments to all other employees are not similarly treated because they  are received within the 2\1/2\ month period. Benefits are ``deferred  benefits'' if, assuming the benefits were cash compensation, such  benefits would be considered deferred compensation. Thus, a plan, or  method or arrangement, shall be presumed to be one providing for  deferred benefits to the extent benefits for services are received by an  employee after the 2\1/2\ month period following the end of the  employer's taxable year in which the related services are rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The taxpayer may rebut the presumption established under the  previous subparagraph with respect to an amount of compensation or  benefits only by setting forth facts and circumstances the preponderance  of which demonstrates that it was impracticable, either administratively  or economically, to avoid the deferral of the receipt by an employee of  the amount of compensation or benefits beyond the applicable 2\1/2\  month period and that, as of the end of the employer's taxable   year such impracticability was unforeseeable. For example, the  presumption may be rebutted with respect to an amount of compensation to  the extent that receipt of such amount is deferred beyond the applicable  2\1/2\ month period (i) either because the funds of the employer were  not sufficient to make the payment within the 2\1/2\ month period  without jeopardizing the solvency of the employer or because it was not  reasonably possible to determine within the 2\1/2\ month period whether  payment of such amount was to be made, and (ii) the circumstance causing  the deferral described in (i) was unforeseeable as of the close of the  employer's taxable year. Thus, the presumption with respect to the  receipt of an amount of compensation or benefit is not rebutted to the  extent it was foreseeable, as of the end of the employer's taxable year,  that the amount would be received after the applicable 2\1/2\ month  period. For example, if, as of the end of the employer's taxable year,  it is foreseeable that calculation of a year-end bonus to be paid to an  employee under a given formula will not be completed and thus the bonus  will not be received (and is in fact not received) by the end of the  applicable 2\1/2\ month period, the presumption that the bonus is  deferred compensation is not rebutted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A plan, or method or arrangement, shall not be considered as  deferring the receipt of compensation or benefits for more than a brief  period of time after the end of the employer's taxable year to the  extent that compensation or benefits are received by the employee on or  before the end of the applicable 2\1/2\ month period. Thus, for example,  salary under an employment contract or a bonus under a year-end bonus  declaration is not considered paid under a plan, or method or  arrangement, deferring the receipt of compensation to the extent that  such salary or bonus is received by the employee on or before the end of  the applicable 2\1/2\ month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Solely for purposes of applying the rules of paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this Q&A;, in the case of an employer's taxable year ending on or  after July 18, 1984, and on or before March 21, 1986, compensation or  benefits that relate to services rendered in such taxable year shall be  deemed to have been received within the applicable 2\1/2\ month period  if such receipt actually occurs after such 2\1/2\ month period but on or  before March 21, 1986.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: When does section 404(b), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of  1984, become effective?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: With the exceptions discussed below, section 404(b), as  amended, and the rules under Q&A-2; are effective with respect to amounts  paid or incurred after July 18, 1984, in taxable years of employers (and  payors) ending after that date.
