In the event the initial homebuyer and his family  vacate the home before having acquired ownership, a subsequent occupant  who enters into a Homebuyer's Ownership Opportunity Agreement and who is  not a successor pursuant to Sec. 904.107(l)(2) is herein called a  ``subsequent homebuyer.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Purchase price schedule. The subsequent homebuyer's Purchase  Price Schedule shall be the same as the unexpired portion of the initial  homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule except that where his purchase price  includes an additional amount as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, the initial homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be  followed by an Additional Purchase Price Schedule for such additional  amount based upon the same monthly debt service and the same interest  rate as applied to the initial homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Residual receipts. After payment in full of the LHA's debt, if  there are any subsequent homebuyers who have not acquired ownership of  their homes, the LHA shall continue to pay to HUD all residual receipts  from the operation of the Project, including payments received on  account of any Additional Purchase Price Schedules applicable to the  homes, provided the aggregate amount of such payments of residual  receipts does not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions  paid by HUD with respect to the Project.</p>
