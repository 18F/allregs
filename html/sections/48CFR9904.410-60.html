                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Business Unit A has been including the cost of scientific  computer operations in its G&A; expense pool. The scientific computer is  used predominantly for research and development, rather than for the  management and administration of the business unit as a whole. The costs  of the scientific computer operation do not satisfy the Standard's  definition of G&A; expense; however, they may remain in the G&A; expense  pool unless they can be allocated to business unit cost objectives on a  beneficial or causal relationship which is best measured by a base other  than a cost input base representing the total activity of a business  unit during a cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Segment B performs a budgeting function, the cost of which is  included in its G&A; expense pool. This function includes the preparation  of budgets for another segment. The cost of preparing the budgets for  the other segment should be removed from B's G&A; expense pool and  transferred to the other segment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit C has a personnel function which is divided  into two parts: A vice president of personnel who establishes personnel  policy and overall guidance, and a personnel department which handles  hirings, testing, evaluations, etc. The expense of the vice president is  included in the G&A; expense pool. The expense of the personnel  department is allocated to the other indirect cost pools based on the  beneficial or causal relationship between that expense and the indirect  cost pools. This procedure is in compliance with the requirements of  this Standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Business Unit C has included selling costs as part of its G&A;  expense pool. Unit C wishes to continue to include selling costs in its  G&A; pool. Under the provisions of this Standard, Unit C may continue to  include selling costs in its G&A; pool, and these costs will be allocated  over a cost input base selected in accordance with the provisions of  9904.410-50(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Business Unit C has included IR&D; and B&P; costs in its G&A;  expense pool. Unit C has used a cost of sales base to allocate its G&A;  expense pool. As of January 1, 1978 (assumed for purposes of this  illustration), the date on which Unit C must first allocate its G&A;  expense pool in accordance with the requirements of this Standard, Unit  C has among its final cost objectives several cost reimbursement  contracts and fixed price contracts subject to the CAS clause (referred  to as the preexisting contracts). If Unit C chooses to use the  transition method in 9904.410-50(e):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unit C shall allocate IR&D; and B&P; costs during the transition  period (from January 1, 1978, to and including the cost accounting  period during which the preexisting contracts are completed), to the  preexisting contracts as part of its G&A; expense pool using a cost of  sales base pursuant to 9904.410-50(e) and appendix A to 9904.410.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During the transition period such costs, as part of the G&A;  expense pool, shall be allocated to new cost reimbursement contracts and  new fixed price contracts subject to the CAS clause using a cost input  base as required by 9904.410-50 (d) and (e) and appendix A to 9904.410.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Beginning with the cost accounting period after the transition  period the IR&D; and B&P; costs, as part of the G&A; expense pool, shall be  allocated to all final cost objectives using a cost input base as  required by 9904.410-50(d). If Unit C chooses not to use the transition  method in 9904.410-50(e), the contractual provision requiring  appropriate equitable adjustment of the prices of affected prime  contracts and subcontracts will be implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Business Unit C has accounted for and allocated IR&D; and B&P;  costs in a cost pool separate and apart from the G&A; expense pool. Unit  C may continue to account for these costs in a separate cost pool under  the provision of this Standard. If Unit C is to use a total cost input  base, these costs when accounted for and allocated in a cost pool  separate and apart from the G&A; expense pool will become part of the  total cost input base used by Unit C to allocate the G&A; expense pool.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Business Unit C has included selling costs as part of its G&A;  expense pool. Unit C has used a cost of sales base to allocate the G&A;  expense pool. Unit C desires to continue to allocate selling costs using  the costs of sales base. Under the provisions of this Standard, Unit C  would account for selling costs as a cost pool separate and apart from  the G&A; expense pool, and continue to allocate these costs over a cost  of sales base. If Unit C uses a total cost input base to allocate the  G&A; expense pool, the selling costs will become part of the total cost  input base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit D has accounted for selling costs in a cost  pool separate and apart from its G&A; expense pool and has allocated  these costs using a cost of sales base. Under the provisions of this  Standard, Unit D may continue to account for those costs in a separate  pool and allocate them using a cost of sales base. Unit D has a total  cost input base to allocate its G&A; expense pool. The selling costs will  become part of the cost input base used by Unit D to allocate the G&A;  expense pool.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During a cost accounting period, Business Unit D buys $2,000,000  of raw   materials. At the end of that cost accounting period, $500,000 of raw  materials inventory have not been charged out to contracts or other cost  objectives. The $500,000 of raw materials are not part of the total cost  input base for the cost accounting period, because they have not been  charged to the production of goods and services during that period. If  all of the $2,000,000 worth of raw material had been charged to cost  objectives during the cost accounting period, the cost input base for  the allocation of the G&A; expense pool would include the entire  $2,000,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Business Unit D manufactures a variety of testing devices.  During a cost accounting period, Unit D acquires and uses a small  building, constructs a small production facility using its own  resources, and keeps for its own use one unit of a testing device that  it manufactures and sells to its customers. The acquisition cost of the  building is not part of the total cost input base; however, the  depreciation taken on the building would be part of the total cost input  base. The costs of construction of the small production facility are not  part of the total cost input base. The requirements of 9904.404 provide  that those G&A; expenses which are identifiable with the constructed  asset and are material in amount shall be capitalized as part of the  cost of the production facility. If there are G&A; expenses material in  amount and identified with the constructed asset, these G&A; expenses  would be removed from the G&A; expense pool prior to the allocation of  this pool to final cost objectives. The cost of the testing device shall  be part of the total cost input base per the requirements of 9904.404  which provides that the costs of constructed assets identical with the  contractor's regular product shall include a full share of indirect  cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit E produces Item Z for stock or product  inventory. The business unit does not include G&A; expense as part of the  inventory cost of these items for costing or financial reporting  purposes. A production run of these items occurred during Cost  Accounting Period 1. A number of the units produced were not issued  during Period 1 and are issued in Period 2. However, those units  produced in Period 1 shall be included in the cost input of that period  for calculating the G&A; expense allocation base and shall not be  included in the cost input of Period 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Business Unit E should apply the G&A; expense rate of Period 1 to  those units of Item Z issued during Period 1 and may apply the rate of  Period 2 to the units issued in Period 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the practice of Business Unit E is to include G&A; expense as  part of the cost of stock or product inventory, the inventory cost of  all units of Item Z produced in Period 1 and remaining in inventory at  the end of Period 1, should include G&A; expense using the G&A; rate of  Period 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business Unit F produced Item X for stock or product  inventory. The business unit does not include G&A; expense as part of the  inventory cost of these items. A production run of these items was  started, finished, and placed into inventory in a single cost accounting  period. These items are issued during the next cost accounting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of items produced for stock or product inventory should  be included in the G&A; base in the same year they are produced. The cost  of such items is not to be included in the G&A; base on the basis of when  they are issued to final cost objectives. Therefore, the time of  issuance of these items from inventory to a final cost objective is  irrelevant in computing the G&A; base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The normal productive activity of Business Unit G includes the  construction of base operating facilities for others. Unit G uses a  total cost input base to allocate G&A; expense to final cost objectives.  As part of a contract to construct an operating facility, Unit G agrees  to acquire a large group of trucks and other mobile equipment to equip  the base operating facility. Unit G does not usually supply such  equipment. The cost of the equipment constitutes a significant part of  the contract cost. A special G&A; allocation to this contract shall be  agreed to by the parties if they agree that in the circumstances the  contract as a whole receives substantially less benefit from the G&A;  expense pool than that which   would be represented by a cost allocation based on inclusion of the  contract cost in the total cost input base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The home office of Segment H separately allocates to  benefiting or causing segments significant home office expenses of staff  management functions relative to manufacturing, staff management  functions relative to engineering, central payment of health insurance  costs, and residual expenses. Segment H receives these expenses as  separate allocations and maintains three indirect cost pools; i.e., G&A;  expense, manufacturing overhead, and engineering overhead; all home  office expenses allocated to Segment H are included in Segment H's G&A;  expense pool.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. Home office residual expenses should be in the G&A;  expense pool, and the expenses of the staff management functions  relative to manufacturing and engineering should be included in the  manufacturing overhead and engineering overhead pools, respectively. The  health insurance costs should be allocated in proportion to the  beneficial and causal relationship between these costs and Segment H's  cost objectives.</p>
