                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon disposition of the resources, the net proceeds to the  individual from the sale are considered available to repay that portion  of the payments that would not have been made had the disposition  occurred at the beginning of the period for which payment was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The net proceeds from disposition will normally be the sales  price less any encumbrance on the resource and the expenses of sale such  as transfer taxes, fees, advertising costs, etc. where, however, a  resource has been   sold (or otherwise transferred) by an individual to a friend or relative  for less than its current market value, the net proceeds will be the  current market value less costs of sale and encumbrance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After deducting any amount necessary to raise the individual's  (and spouse's, if any) resources to the applicable limits described in  Sec. 416.1205, as of the beginning of the disposition period, the  balance of the net proceeds will be used to recover the payments made to  the individual (and spouse, if any). Any remaining proceeds are  considered liquid resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The overpayment to be recovered is equal to the balance of the  net proceeds (as described in paragraph (c) of this section) or the  total payments made to the individual (and spouse, if any) for the  period of disposition, whichever is less.
