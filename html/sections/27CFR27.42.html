The tax is imposed on each wine gallon and at a  like rate on fractional parts of a wine gallon. Fractions of less than  one-tenth gallon shall be   converted to the nearest one-tenth gallon, and five-hundredths gallon  shall be converted to the next full one-tenth gallon. All wines  containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume shall be classed as  distilled spirits and shall be taxed accordingly.

Such tolerance will not be allowed where it  is found that the limitation of 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per 100  milliliters of wine is continuously or intentionally exceeded.  [T.D.
