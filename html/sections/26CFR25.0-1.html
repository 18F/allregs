                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulations in this part are designated  ``Gift Tax Regulations.'' These regulations pertain to (i) the gift tax  imposed by Chapter 12 of Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code on the  transfer of property by gift by individuals in the calendar year 1955,  in subsequent calendar years beginning before the calendar year 1971, in  calendar quarters beginning with   the first calendar quarter of calendar year 1971 through the last  calendar quarter of the calendar year 1981, and in calendar years  beginning with the calendar year 1982, and (ii) certain related  administrative provisions of Subtitle F of the Code. It should be noted  that the application of some of the provisions of these regulations may  be affected by the provisions of an applicable gift tax convention with  a foreign country. Unless otherwise indicated, references in these  regulations to the ``Internal Revenue Code'' or the ``Code'' are  references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and  references to a section or other provision of law are references to a  section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as  amended. The Gift Tax Regulations are applicable to the transfer of  property by gift by individuals in calendar years 1955 through 1970, in  calendar quarters beginning with the first calendar quarter of calendar  year 1971 through the last calendar quarter of the calendar year 1981,  and in calendar years beginning with the calendar year 1982, and  supersede the regulations contained in part 86, subchapter B, Chapter 1,  title 26, Code of Federal Regulations (1939) (Regulations 108, Gift Tax  (8 FR 10858)), as prescribed and made applicable to the Internal Revenue  Code of 1954 by Treasury Decision 6091, signed August 16, 1954 (19 FR  5167, Aug. 17, 1954).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 2501(b) makes the provisions of Chapter 12 of the Code  apply in the case of gifts made after September 2, 1958, by certain  citizens of the United States who were residents of a possession thereof  at the time the gifts were made. Section 2501(c) makes the provisions of  Chapter 12 apply in the case of gifts made after September 14, 1960, by  certain other citizens of the United States who were residents of a  possession thereof at the time the gifts were made. See paragraphs (c)  and (d) of Sec. 25.2501-1. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs  (c) and (d) of Sec. 25.2501-1, the provisions of these regulations do  not apply to the making of gifts by such citizens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nature of tax. The gift tax is not a property tax. It is a tax  imposed upon the transfer of property by individuals. It is not  applicable to transfers by corporations or persons other than  individuals. However, see paragraph (h)(1) of Sec. 25.2511-1 with  respect to the extent to which a transfer by or to a corporation is  considered a transfer by or to its shareholders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope of regulations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination of tax liability.  subchapter A of Chapter 12 of the Code pertains to the determination of  tax liability. The regulations pursuant to subchapter A are set forth in  Sec. Sec. 25.2501-1 through 25.2504-2. Sections 25.2701-5 and 25.2702-6  contain rules that provide additional adjustments to mitigate double  taxation where the amount of the transferor's property was previously  determined under the special valuation provisions of sections 2701 and  2702.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transfer. Subchapter B of chapter 12 and chapter 14 of the  Internal Revenue Code pertain to the transfers which constitute the  making of gifts and the valuation of those transfers. The regulations  pursuant to subchapter B are set forth in Sec. Sec. 25.2511-1 through  25.2518-3. The regulations pursuant to chapter 14 are set forth in  Sec. Sec. 25.2701-1 through 25.2704-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deductions. Subchapter C of Chapter 12 of the Code pertains to  the deductions which are allowed in determining the amount of taxable  gifts. The regulations pursuant to Subchapter C are set forth in  Sec. Sec. 25.2521-1 through 25.2524-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedure and administration provisions. Subtitle F of the  Internal Revenue Code contains some sections which are applicable to the  gift tax. The regulations pursuant to those sections are set forth in  Sec. Sec. 25.6001-1 through 25.7101-1. Such regulations do not purport  to be all the regulations on procedure and administration which are  pertinent to gift tax matters. For the remainder of the regulations on  procedure and administration which are pertinent to gift tax matters,  see part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and  Administration).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Arrangement and numbering. Each section of the regulations in  this part (other than this section) is designated by a number composed  of the part number followed by a decimal point (25.); the section of the  Internal Revenue Code which it interprets; a hyphen (-); and a number  identifying this   section. By use of these designations one can ascertain the sections of  the regulations relating to a provision of the Code. For example, the  regulations pertaining to section 2521 of the Code are designated Sec.  25.2521-1.  [T.D. 6334, 23 FR 8904, Nov. 15, 1958, as amended by T.D. 6542, 26 FR  548, Jan. 20, 1961; 45 FR 6089, Jan. 25, 1980; T.D. 7910, 48 FR 40372,  Sept. 7, 1983; T.D. 8395, 57 FR 4254, Feb. 4, 1992]</p><p class="depth0">Determination of Tax Liability    Sec. 25.2207A-1  Right of recovery of gift taxes in the case of certain marital deduction property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> applies is the value of all interests in the property  other than the qualifying income interest. There is no right of recovery  from any person for the property received by that person for which a  deduction was allowed from the total amount of gifts, if no Federal gift  tax is attributable to the property. The right of recovery arises at the  time the Federal gift tax is actually paid by the transferor subject to  section 2519.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure of a person to exercise the right of recovery. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  failure of a person to exercise a right of recovery provided by section  2207A(b) upon a lifetime transfer subject to section 2519 is treated as  a transfer for Federal gift tax purposes of the unrecovered amounts to  the person(s) from whom the recovery could have been obtained. See Sec.  25.2511-1. The transfer is considered to be made when the right to  recovery is no longer enforceable under applicable law and is treated as  a gift even if recovery is impossible. A delay in the exercise of the  right of recovery without payment of sufficient interest is a below- market loan. Section 1.7872-5T of this chapter describes factors that  are used to determine, based on the facts and circumstances of a  particular case, whether a loan otherwise subject to imputation under  section 7872 (relating to the treatment of below-market loans) is  exempted from its provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transferor subject to section 2519 may execute a written  waiver of the right of recovery arising under section 2207A before that  right of recovery becomes unenforceable. If a waiver is executed, the  transfer of the unrecovered amounts by the transferor is considered to  be made on the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date of the valid and irrevocable waiver rendering the right  of recovery no longer enforceable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of the payment of the tax by the transferor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of gift tax attributable to all properties. The amount of  Federal gift tax attributable to all properties includible in the total  amount of gifts under section 2519 made during the calendar year is the  amount by which the total Federal gift tax for the calendar year  (including penalties and interest attributable to the tax) under chapter  12 of the Internal Revenue Code which has been paid, exceeds the total  Federal gift tax for the calendar year (including penalties and interest  attributable to the tax) under chapter 12 of the Internal Revenue Code  which would have been paid if the value of the properties includible in  the total amount of gifts by reason of section 2519 had not been  included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount of gift tax attributable to a particular property. A  person's right of recovery with respect to a particular property is an  amount equal to the amount determined in paragraph (c) of this section  multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the value of  the particular property included in the total amount of gifts made  during the calendar year by reason of section 2519, less any deduction  allowed with respect to the property. The denominator of the fraction is  the total value of all properties included in the total amount of gifts  made during the calendar year by reason of section 2519, less any  deductions allowed with respect to those properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>  does not affect the right, if any, under local law, of any person with  an interest in property to reimbursement or contribution from another  person with an interest in the property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example. D created an inter vivos trust during 1994 with certain  income producing assets valued at $1,000,000. The trust provides that  all income is payable to D's wife, S, for S's life, with the remainder  at S's death to be divided equally among their four children. In  computing taxable gifts during calendar year 1994, D deducted, pursuant  to section 2523(f), $1,000,000 from the total amount of gifts made. In  addition, assume that S received no other transfers from D and that S  made a gift during 1996 of the entire life interest to one of the  children, at which time the value of trust assets was $1,080,000 and the  value of S's life interest was $400,000. Although the entire value of  the trust assets ($1,080,000) is, pursuant to sections 2511 and 2519,  included in the total amount of S's gifts for calendar year 1996, S is  only entitled to reimbursement for the Federal gift tax attributable to  the value of the remainder interest, that is, the Federal gift tax  attributable to $680,000 ($1,080,000 less $400,000). The Federal gift  tax attributable to $680,000 is equal to the amount by which the total  Federal gift tax (including penalties and interest) paid for the  calendar year exceeds the federal gift tax (including penalties and  interest) that would have been paid if the total amount of gifts during  1996 had been reduced by $680,000. That amount of tax may be recovered  by S from the trust.  [T.D. 8522, 59 FR 9655, Mar. 1, 1994, as amended by T.D. 9077, 68 FR  42595, July 18, 2003]    Sec. 25.2207A-2  Effective date.</p><p class="depth2">The provisions of Sec. 25.2207A-1 are effective with respect to  dispositions made after March 1, 1994. With respect to gifts made on or  before such date, the donor may rely on any reasonable interpretation of  the statutory provisions. For these purposes, the provisions of Sec.  25.2207A-1 (as well as project LR-211-76, 1984-1 C.B., page 598, see  Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter), are considered a reasonable  interpretation of the statutory provisions.
