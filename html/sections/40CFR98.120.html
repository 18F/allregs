                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The fluorinated gas production source category consists of  processes that produce a fluorinated gas from any raw material or  feedstock chemical, except for processes that generate HFC-23 during the  production of HCFC-22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.  Producing a fluorinated gas also includes the manufacture of a  chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) from any raw  material or feedstock chemical, including manufacture of a CFC or HCFC  as an isolated intermediate for use in a process that will result in the  transformation of the CFC or HCFC either at or outside of the production  facility. Producing a fluorinated gas does not include the reuse or  recycling of a fluorinated gas, the creation of HFC-23 during the  production of HCFC-22, the creation of intermediates that are created  and transformed in a single process with no storage of the  intermediates, or the creation of fluorinated GHGs that are released or  destroyed at the production facility before the production measurement  in Sec. 98.414(a).</p>
