                            <p class="depth0">This section contains requirements that apply to performing each  test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Test conditions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The tests and each step in the tests must  be carried out in the order described in this section. Each test must be  performed without time delay between steps in the test. No maintenance,  including replacement of parts, may be performed on the meter during or  between the tests described in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A test rig of the type described in Sec. 162.050-19 must be  used when performing each test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each mixture used during the tests must be prepared by combining  oil supplied from the oil injection pipe of the test rig and water  supplied from the mixture tank of the test rig. However, if the flow of  oil through the oil injection pipe becomes intermittent, oil and water  may be combined in the mixture tank to form the mixture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A mixture may be circulated through a meter only once during  testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unless otherwise provided in a specific test, the water used in  each test must be clean, fresh water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The oil used in each test, except Test No. 2 in paragraph (c) of  this section, must be Arabian light crude oil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Each test must be performed at an ambient temperature of between  10 [deg]C and 30 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Unless otherwise provided in a specific test, each test must be  performed at the maximum mixture pressure, the maximum flow rate, and  the power supply ratings at which the meter is designed to operate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The particulate contaminant described in Test No. 5 in paragraph  (f) of this section, if not attapulgite, must be of a type that does not  lose more than 3 percent of its weight after ignition and must be  insoluble in a 500 ppm mixture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> In each test the meter must be operated in accordance with the  procedures described in its instructions manual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Unless otherwise provided in a specific test, the centrifugal  pump shown in Figure 162.050-19 in Sec. 162.050-19 must be operated at  1,000 revolutions per minute or more in each test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Whenever the oil content of a mixture is recorded, a sample of  the mixture must also be taken. The oil content of the sample must be  measured using the method described in Sec. 162.050-39.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A one-liter sample of each oil to be used in testing must be  taken and provided for use in the sample analysis required by Sec.  162.050-39.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test No. 1 Calibration and Zero Test. The meter is calibrated  and zeroed to manufacturer's instructions. It is then fed with water for  15 minutes and then with mixtures in the following concentrations: 15  ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, and each additional concentration, in increments  of 50 ppm up to the highest oil concentration that can be read on the  meter. Each mixture is fed to the meter in the order listed in Table  162.050-27(c) for 15 minutes. Water is fed to the meter for a 15-minute  period between each mixture. At the end of each 15-minute period, an oil  content reading is obtained and recorded, and a calibration curve must  be created.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test No. 2 Response to Different Oil Types Test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  meter is designed for use with crude oils, it is fed with a mixture of  water and the first oil listed in Table 162.050-27(c) at the following  concentrations: 15 ppm, 100 ppm, and a concentration that is 90 percent  of the highest oil concentration in water that can be read on the meter.  Each concentration is fed to the meter in the order listed until a  steady reading occurs and is recorded. After each steady reading is  recorded, the meter is fed with water for 15 minutes. At the end of each  15-minute period of feeding the meter with water, an oil content reading  is again obtained and recorded, and a calibration curve must be created.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The steps described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are  repeated using each of the other oils listed in Table 162.050-27(c). A  calibration curve must be created for each oil tested.</p><p class="depth3">Table 162.050-27(c)--Oil Type and Characteristics ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Oil type                                              Characteristics ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sahara blend crude oil......................
