                                Sec.  110.46  Amending a Request Package.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. All requesters may amend their documentation  concerning eligibility up to the time the Secretary has made an  eligibility determination. Requesters are expected to submit additional  medical records as they become available. Requesters also may amend  their information or documentation concerning the calculation of  benefits until the Secretary has made a benefits determination. Once an  eligibility determination has been made, the Secretary will not accept  additional documentation concerning eligibility, except as described in  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Once a benefits determination  has been made, the Secretary will not accept additional documentation  regarding the type or amount of benefits for that covered injury, except  as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requesters who are survivors. If an injured countermeasure  recipient submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but  subsequently dies, or the executor or administrator timely filed on  behalf of the estate, the survivor(s) may amend the previously filed  Request Package at any time by filing a new Request Form in order to be  considered for death benefits. Such an amendment can be filed regardless  of whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid  benefits with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's  Request Package. However, a survivor filing an amendment to a previously  filed Request Package may only be eligible for benefits if the  previously filed Request Package was filed within the governing filing  deadline. All documentation that has already been submitted with respect  to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient will be considered part  of the survivor requester's Request Package, and he or she is not  required to resubmit such documentation. Survivor requesters must also  file an amendment to a Request Package if there is a change in the order  of priority of survivors, as described in Sec.  110.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests in which the benefits are sought for the estate of a  deceased injured countermeasure recipient. If an injured countermeasure  recipient submitted a Request Form within the filing deadline, but  subsequently dies before all due benefits are paid by the Program,   the executor or administrator of his or her estate may amend his or her  Request Package at any time in order for the estate to be considered for  benefits. This opportunity to amend applies also if the Request Form was  timely filed by a survivor. Such an amendment can be filed regardless of  whether the Secretary made an eligibility determination or paid benefits  with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient's Request  Package. However, the executor or administrator of the deceased injured  countermeasure recipient's estate filing an amendment to a previously  filed Request Package may only be eligible to receive benefits on behalf  of the estate if the previously filed Request Package was filed within  the governing deadline. All documentation that has already been  submitted with respect to the deceased injured countermeasure recipient  will be considered part of that person's Request Package, and the  executor or administrator of the estate is not required to resubmit such  documentation.</p>
