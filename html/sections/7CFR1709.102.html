RUS may also give priority to projects that are coordinated with State rural development initiatives or that serve a Federally-identified Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) or a USDA-identified ``Champion Community.'' Priority consideration will be provided through the award of additional points under the project selection criteria as specified in the grant announcement.
