                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding part 309 of this subchapter, an official establishment that wishes to slaughter horses can apply for voluntary ante-mortem inspection according to Sec. 352.3. Such establishments shall pay the applicable base time, overtime, and holiday rates for ante-mortem inspection in accordance with Sec. 352.5.

If the establishment complies with all these requirements for ante-mortem inspection, FSIS will conduct ante-mortem inspection at that establishment in accordance with Sec. 352.10, and all other provisions in part 309 of this subchapter that pertain to horses will apply. FSIS may deny or withdraw ante-mortem inspection services at official establishments that slaughter horses for any applicable reason under Sec. 352.6. Official marks and devices to identify inspected and passed horse carcasses and parts of carcasses, or horse meat food products shall be those in Sec. 312.3 of this subchapter.
