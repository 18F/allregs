                            <p class="depth0">The standard of review for an appeal of a SDVO SBC protest  determination is whether the D/GC's determination was based on clear  error of fact or law. With respect to status determinations on whether  the owner is a veteran, service-disabled veteran, or veteran with a  permanent and severe disability, the Judge will not review the  determinations made by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs, U.S.  Department of Defense, or such determinations identified by documents  provided by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
