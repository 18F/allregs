                            <p class="depth0">The utilization goal is not a rigid and inflexible quota which must  be met, nor is it to be considered either a ceiling or a floor for the  employment of particular groups. Quotas are expressly forbidden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Goal. OFCCP has established a utilization goal of 7 percent for  employment of qualified individuals with disabilities for each job group  in the contractor's workforce, or for the contractor's entire workforce  as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the utilization goal is to establish a  benchmark against which the contractor must measure the representation  of individuals within each job group in its workforce, or within the  contractor's entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this  section. The utilization goal serves as an equal employment opportunity  objective that should be attainable by complying with all aspects of the  affirmative action requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic review of goal. The Director of OFCCP shall  periodically review and update, as appropriate, the utilization goal  established in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Utilization analysis--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The utilization analysis is  designed to evaluate the representation of individuals with disabilities  in each job group within the contractor's workforce, or to evaluate the  representation of individuals with disabilities in the contractor's  entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section,  with the utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grouping jobs for analysis. The contractor must use the same job  groups established for utilization analyses under Executive Order 11246,  either in accordance with 41 CFR part 60-2, or in accordance with 41 CFR  part 60-4, as appropriate, except as provided below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contractors with 100 or fewer employees. If a contractor has a  total workforce of 100 or fewer employees, it need not use the jobs  groups established for utilization analyses under Executive Order 11246,  and has the option to measure the representation of individuals with  disabilities in its entire workforce with the utilization goal  established in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Annual evaluation. The contractor shall annually evaluate its  utilization of individuals with disabilities in each job group, or in  its entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identification of problem areas. When the percentage of  individuals with disabilities in one or more job groups, or in a  contractor's entire workforce as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this  section, is less than the utilization goal established in paragraph (a)  of this section, the contractor must take steps to determine whether and  where impediments to equal employment opportunity exist. When   making this determination, the contractor must assess its personnel  processes, the effectiveness of its outreach and recruitment efforts,  the results of its affirmative action program audit, and any other areas  that might affect the success of the affirmative action program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em>, and/or other actions designed to correct the  identified problem areas and attain the established goal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A contractor's determination that it has not attained the  utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this section in one or  more job groups does not constitute either a finding or admission of  discrimination in violation of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The utilization goal established in paragraph (a) of this  section shall not be used as a quota or ceiling that limits or restricts  the employment of individuals with disabilities.</p>
