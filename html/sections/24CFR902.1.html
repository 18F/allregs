                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the Public Housing Assessment System  (PHAS) is to improve the delivery of services in public housing and  enhance trust in the public housing system among public housing agencies  (PHAs), public housing residents, and the general public, by providing a  management tool for effectively and fairly measuring the performance of  a PHA in essential housing operations of projects, on a program-wide  basis and individual project basis, and providing rewards for high  performers and remedial requirements for poor performers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. PHAS is a strategic measure of the essential housing  operations of projects and PHAs. PHAS does not evaluate the compliance  of a project or PHA with every HUD-wide or program-specific requirement  or objective. Although not specifically evaluated through PHAS, PHAs are  responsible for complying with nondiscrimination and equal opportunity  requirements, including but not limited to those specified in 24 CFR  5.105, for affirmatively furthering fair housing, requirements under  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and  requirements of other federal programs under which the PHA is receiving  assistance. A PHA's adherence to these requirements will be monitored in  accordance with the applicable program regulations and the PHA's Annual  Contributions Contract (ACC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> PHAS indicators. HUD will assess and score the performance of  projects and PHAs based on the indicators, which are more fully  addressed in Sec. 902.9: Physical condition, financial condition,  management operations, and the Capital Fund program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assessment tools. HUD will make use of uniform and objective  criteria for the physical inspection of projects and PHAs and the  financial assessment of projects and PHAs, and will use data from  appropriate agency data systems to assess management operations. For the  Capital Fund program indicator, HUD will use information provided in the  electronic Line of Credit Control System (eLOCCS), the Public Housing  Information Center (PIC), or their successor systems. On the basis of  this data, HUD will assess and score the results, advise PHAs of their  scores, and identify low-scoring and poor-performing projects and PHAs  so that these projects and PHAs will receive the appropriate attention  and assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Small PHAs. A PHA with fewer than 250 units that does not  convert to asset management will be considered as one project by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> HUD's scoring procedures will be published from time to time in  the Federal Register for public comment.</p>
