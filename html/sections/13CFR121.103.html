                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General Principles of Affiliation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Concerns and entities are  affiliates of each other when one controls or has the power to control  the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to  control both. It does not matter whether control is exercised, so long  as the power to control exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> SBA considers factors such as ownership, management, previous  relationships with or ties to another concern, and contractual  relationships, in determining whether affiliation exists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control may be affirmative or negative. Negative control  includes, but is not limited to, instances where a minority shareholder  has the ability, under the concern's charter, by-laws, or shareholder's  agreement, to prevent a quorum or otherwise block action by the board of  directors or shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Affiliation may be found where an individual, concern, or entity  exercises control indirectly through a third party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In determining whether affiliation exists, SBA will consider the  totality of the circumstances, and may find affiliation even though no  single factor is sufficient to constitute affiliation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In determining the concern's size, SBA counts the receipts,  employees, or other measure of size of the concern whose size is at  issue and all of its domestic and foreign affiliates, regardless of  whether the affiliates are organized for profit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> For SBA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small  Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, the bases for affiliation  are set forth in Sec. 121.702.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions to affiliation coverage. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Business concerns owned  in whole or substantial part by investment companies licensed, or  development companies qualifying, under the Small Business Investment  Act of 1958, as amended, are not considered affiliates of such  investment companies or development companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Business concerns owned and controlled by Indian Tribes,  Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) organized pursuant to the Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), Native Hawaiian  Organizations (NHOs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs)  authorized by 42 U.S.C. 9805, or wholly-owned entities of Indian Tribes,  ANCs, NHOs, or CDCs are not considered affiliates of such entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Business concerns owned and controlled by Indian Tribes, ANCs,  NHOs, CDCs, or wholly-owned entities of Indian Tribes, ANCs, NHOs, or  CDCs are not considered to be affiliated with other concerns owned by  these entities because of their common ownership or common management.  In addition, affiliation will not be found based upon the performance of  common administrative services, such as bookkeeping and payroll, so long  as adequate payment is provided for those services. Affiliation may be  found for other reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business concerns which are part of an SBA approved pool of  concerns for a joint program of research and development or for defense  production as authorized by the Small Business Act are not affiliates of  one another because of the pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Business concerns which lease employees from concerns primarily  engaged in leasing employees to other businesses or which enter into a  co-employer arrangement with a Professional Employer Organization (PEO)  are not affiliated with the leasing company or PEO solely on the basis  of a leasing agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> (i) through  (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Venture capital operating companies, as defined in the U.S.  Department of Labor regulations found at 29 CFR 2510.3-101(d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employee benefit or pension plans established and maintained by  the Federal government or any state, or their political subdivisions, or  any agency or instrumentality thereof, for the benefit of employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employee benefit or pension plans within the meaning of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C.  1001, et seq.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Charitable trusts, foundations, endowments, or similar  organizations exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501(c)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 501(c));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act  of 1940, as amended (1940 Act) (15 U.S.C. 80a-1, et seq.); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Investment companies, as defined under the 1940 Act, which are  not registered under the 1940 Act because they are beneficially owned by  less than 100 persons, if the company's sales literature or  organizational documents indicate that its principal purpose is  investment in securities rather than the operation of commercial  enterprises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An 8(a) BD Participant that has an SBA-approved mentor/proteegee  agreement is not affiliated with a mentor firm solely because the  proteegee firm receives assistance from the mentor under the agreement.  Similarly, a proteegee firm is not affiliated with its mentor solely  because the proteegee firm receives assistance from the mentor under a  Federal Mentor-Proteegee program where an exception to affiliation is  specifically authorized by statute or by SBA under the procedures set  forth in Sec. 121.903. Affiliation may be found in either case for other  reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The member shareholders of a small agricultural cooperative, as  defined in the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j), are not  considered affiliated with the cooperative by virtue of their membership  in the cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> These exceptions to affiliation and any others set forth in  Sec. 121.702 apply for purposes of SBA's SBIR and STTR programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled contract  with a reserve (as defined in Sec. 125.1), a small business concern  prime contractor may enter into a Small Business Teaming Arrangement  with one or more other small business concerns and submit an offer as a  small business for a Federal procurement without regard to affiliation,  so long as each team member is small under the size standard  corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract and there is a  written, signed teaming or joint venture agreement amongst the small  business concerns. See Sec. 125.1 for the definition of Small Business  Teaming Arrangement. With respect to Small Business Teaming Arrangements  that are joint ventures, see Sec. 121.103(h) for specific requirements  and limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Affiliation based on stock ownership. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A person (including  any individual, concern or other entity) that owns, or has the power to  control, 50 percent or more of a concern's voting stock, or a block of  voting stock which is large compared to other outstanding blocks of  voting stock, controls or has the power to control the concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If two or more persons (including any individual, concern or  other entity) each owns, controls, or has the power to control less than  50 percent of   a concern's voting stock, and such minority holdings are equal or  approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority  holdings is large as compared with any other stock holding, SBA presumes  that each such person controls or has the power to control the concern  whose size is at issue. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing  that such control or power to control does not in fact exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a concern's voting stock is widely held and no single block  of stock is large as compared with all other stock holdings, the  concern's Board of Directors and CEO or President will be deemed to have  the power to control the concern in the absence of evidence to the  contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible securities,  and agreements to merge. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In determining size, SBA considers stock  options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge (including  agreements in principle) to have a present effect on the power to  control a concern. SBA treats such options, convertible securities, and  agreements as though the rights granted have been exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agreements to open or continue negotiations towards the  possibility of a merger or a sale of stock at some later date are not  considered ``agreements in principle'' and are thus not given present  effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Options, convertible securities, and agreements that are subject  to conditions precedent which are incapable of fulfillment, speculative,  conjectural, or unenforceable under state or Federal law, or where the  probability of the transaction (or exercise of the rights) occurring is  shown to be extremely remote, are not given present effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An individual, concern or other entity that controls one or more  other concerns cannot use options, convertible securities, or agreements  to appear to terminate such control before actually doing so. SBA will  not give present effect to individuals', concerns' or other entities'  ability to divest all or part of their ownership interest in order to  avoid a finding of affiliation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Affiliation based on common management. Affiliation arises where  one or more officers, directors, managing members, or partners who  control the board of directors and/or management of one concern also  control the board of directors or management of one or more other  concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Affiliation based on identity of interest. Affiliation may arise  among two or more persons with an identity of interest. Individuals or  firms that have identical or substantially identical business or  economic interests (such as family members, individuals or firms with  common investments, or firms that are economically dependent through  contractual or other relationships) may be treated as one party with  such interests aggregated. Where SBA determines that such interests  should be aggregated, an individual or firm may rebut that determination  with evidence showing that the interests deemed to be one are in fact  separate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Affiliation based on the newly organized concern rule.  Affiliation may arise where former officers, directors, principal  stockholders, managing members, or key employees of one concern organize  a new concern in the same or related industry or field of operation, and  serve as the new concern's officers, directors, principal stockholders,  managing members, or key employees, and the one concern is furnishing or  will furnish the new concern with contracts, financial or technical  assistance, indemnification on bid or performance bonds, and/or other  facilities, whether for a fee or otherwise. A concern may rebut such an  affiliation determination by demonstrating a clear line of fracture  between the two concerns. A ``key employee'' is an employee who, because  of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or  substantive control over the operations or management of the concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1 to paragraph (h) introductory text. Joint Venture AB has  received two contracts. On April 2, Joint Venture AB submits an offer  for Solicitation 1. On June 6, Joint Venture AB submits an offer for  Solicitation 2. On July 13, Joint Venture AB submits an offer for  Solicitation 3. In September, Joint Venture AB is found to be the  apparent successful offeror for all three solicitations. Even though the  award of the three contracts would give Joint Venture AB a total of five  contract awards, it could receive those awards without causing general  affiliation between its joint venture partners because Joint Venture AB  had not yet received three contract awards as of the dates of the offers  for each of three solicitations at issue.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2 to paragraph (h) introductory text. Joint Venture XY  receives a contract on December 19, year 1. It may receive two  additional contracts through December 19, year 3. On August 6, year 2,  XY receives a second contract. It receives no other contract awards  through December 19, year 3 and has submitted no additional offers prior  to December 19, year 3. Because two years have passed since the date of  the first contract award, after December 19, year 3, XY cannot receive  an additional contract award. The individual parties to XY must form a  new joint venture if they want to seek and be awarded additional  contracts as a joint venture.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3 to paragraph (h) introductory text. Joint Venture XY  receives a contract on December 19, year 1. On May 22, year 2, XY  submits an offer for Solicitation 1. On June 10, year 2, XY submits an  offer for Solicitation 2. On June 19, year 2, XY receives a second  contract responding to Solicitation 1. XY is not awarded a contract  responding to Solicitation 2. On December 15, year 3, XY submits an  offer for Solicitation 3. In January, XY is found to be the apparent  successful offeror for Solicitation 3. XY is eligible for the contract  award because compliance with the three awards in two years rule is  determined as of the date of the initial offer including price, XY  submitted its offer prior to December 19, year 3, and XY had not  received three contract awards prior to its offer on December 15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Parties to a joint venture are affiliates if any one of them  seeks SBA financial assistance for use in connection with the joint  venture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, concerns  submitting offers on a particular procurement or property sale as joint  venturers are affiliated with each other with regard to the performance  of that contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception to affiliation for certain joint ventures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A joint  venture of two or more business concerns may submit an offer as a small  business for a Federal procurement without regard to affiliation under  paragraph (h) of this section so long as each concern is small under the  size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract,  provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The procurement qualifies as a bundled or consolidated  requirement, at any dollar value, within the meaning of Sec. 125.2(d) of  this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The procurement is other than bundled or consolidated  requirement   within the meaning of Sec. 125.2(d) of this chapter, and:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a procurement having a receipts based size standard, the  dollar value of the procurement, including options, exceeds half the  size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a procurement having an employee-based size standard, the  dollar value of the procurement, including options, exceeds $10 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A joint venture of at least one 8(a) Participant and one or  more other business concerns may submit an offer for a competitive 8(a)  procurement without regard to affiliation under paragraph (h) of this  section so long as the requirements of Sec. 124.513(b)(1) of this  chapter are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Two firms approved by SBA to be a mentor and proteegee under  Sec. 124.520 of these regulations may joint venture as a small business  for any Federal government prime contract or subcontract, provided the  proteegee qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the  NAICS code assigned to the procurement and, for purposes of 8(a) sole  source requirements, has not reached the dollar limit set forth in  Sec. 124.519 of these regulations. If the procurement is to be awarded  through the 8(a) BD program, SBA must approve the joint venture pursuant  to Sec. 124.513. If the procurement is to be awarded other than through  the 8(a) BD program (e.g., small business set aside, HUBZone set aside),  SBA need not approve the joint venture prior to award, but if the size  status of the joint venture is protested, the provisions of  Secs. 124.513(c) and (d) will apply. This means that the joint venture  must meet the requirements of Secs. 124.513(c) and (d) in order to  receive the exception to affiliation authorized by this paragraph. In  either case, after contract performance is complete, the 8(a) partner to  the joint venture must submit a report to its servicing SBA district  office explaining how the applicable performance of work requirements  were met for the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A contractor and its ostensible subcontractor are treated as  joint venturers, and therefore affiliates, for size determination  purposes. An ostensible subcontractor is a subcontractor that performs  primary and vital requirements of a contract, or of an order under a  multiple award schedule contract, or a subcontractor upon which the  prime contractor is unusually reliant. All aspects of the relationship  between the prime and subcontractor are considered, including, but not  limited to, the terms of the proposal (such as contract management,  technical responsibilities, and the percentage of subcontracted work),  agreements between the prime and subcontractor (such as bonding  assistance or the teaming agreement), and whether the subcontractor is  the incumbent contractor and is ineligible to submit a proposal because  it exceeds the applicable size standard for that solicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For size purposes, a concern must include in its receipts its  proportionate share of joint venture receipts, and in its total number  of employees its proportionate share of joint venture employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Affiliation based on franchise and license agreements. The  restraints imposed on a franchisee or licensee by its franchise or  license agreement relating to standardized quality, advertising,  accounting format and other similar provisions, generally will not be  considered in determining whether the franchisor or licensor is  affiliated with the franchisee or licensee provided the franchisee or  licensee has the right to profit from its efforts and bears the risk of  loss commensurate with ownership. Affiliation may arise, however,  through other means, such as common ownership, common management or  excessive restrictions upon the sale of the franchise interest.
