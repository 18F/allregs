                            <p class="depth0">The quality index of cottonseed shall be an index of purity and  soundness, and shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prime quality cottonseed. Cottonseed that by analysis contains  not more than 1.0 percent of foreign matter, not more than 12.0 percent  of moisture, and not more than 1.8 percent of free fatty acids in the  oil in the seed, shall be known as prime quality cottonseed and shall  have a quality index of 100.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Below prime quality cottonseed. The quality index of cottonseed  that, by analysis, contain foreign matter, moisture, or free fatty acids  in the oil in the seed, in excess of the percentages prescribed in  paragraph (a) of this section shall be found by reducing the quality  index of prime quality cottonseed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Four-tenths of a unit for each 0.1 percent of free fatty acids  in the oil in the seed in excess of 1.8 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-tenth of a unit for each 0.1 percent of foreign matter in  excess of 1.0 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One-tenth of a unit for each 0.1 percent of moisture in excess  of 12.0 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Off quality cottonseed. Cottonseed that has been treated by  either mechanical or chemical process other than the usual cleaning,  drying, and ginning (except sterilization required by the United States  Department of Agriculture for quarantine purposes) or   that are fermented or hot, or that upon analysis are found to contain  12.5 percent or more of free fatty acids in the oil in the seed, or more  than 10.0 percent of foreign matter, or more than 20.0 percent of  moisture, or more than 25.0 percent of moisture and foreign matter  combined, shall be designated as ``off quality cottonseed.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Below grade cottonseed. Cottonseed the grade of which when  calculated according to Sec. 61.101 is below grade 40.0 shall be  designated as ``below grade cottonseed,'' and a numerical grade shall  not be indicated.</p>
