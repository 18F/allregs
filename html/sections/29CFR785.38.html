                                Sec. 785.38  Travel that is all in the day's work.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Time spent by an employee in travel as part of his principal  activity, such as travel from job site to job site during the workday,  must be counted as hours worked. Where an employee is required to report  at a meeting place to receive instructions or to perform other work  there, or to pick up and to carry tools, the travel from the designated  place to the work place is part of the day's work, and must be counted  as hours worked regardless of contract, custom, or practice. If an  employee normally finishes his work on the premises at 5 p.m. and is  sent to another job which he finishes at 8 p.m. and is required to  return to his employer's premises arriving at 9 p.m., all of the time is  working time. However, if the employee goes home instead of returning to  his employer's premises, the travel after 8 p.m. is home-to-work travel  and is not hours worked. (Walling v. Mid-Continent Pipe Line Co., 143 F.  2d 308 (C. A. 10, 1944))</p>
