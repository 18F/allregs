                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. VA may make payments to employers to enable a veteran  who has been rehabilitated to employability to begin and maintain  employment or to provide on-job training. The purpose of such payment is  to facilitate the placement of veterans who are generally qualified for  employment but may lack some specific training or work experience which  the employer requires or who are difficult to place due to their  disability. The specific conditions which must be met before this option  may be considered are contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for payments to employers. Payments may be made to  employers to provide on-job training or to begin and maintain employment  if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The veteran is in need of an on-job training situation or is  generally qualified for employment but such on-job situation or  employment opportunity is not otherwise available despite repeated and  intensive efforts on the part of VA and the veteran to secure such  opportunities. These conditions are also considered to be met when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There are few employers within commuting distance of the  veteran's home who can provide a training or employment opportunity  consistent with the veteran's plan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The veteran reasonably could not be required to seek on-job or  employment opportunities in other areas due to the effects of his or her  disability, family situation, or other pertinent factors; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The available local employers will only provide a training or  employment opportunity if VA agrees to reimburse for direct expenses to  the degree permitted under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The training establishment or employer is in compliance with  provisions of Sec. 21.292 (a) and (b), pertaining to the approval of  courses and facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> VA entered into an agreement with the employer in writing prior  to the beginning of the period of on-job training or employment, whereby  the employer will be reimbursed for direct expenses approved under  provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The on-job training program or employment of the veteran does  not displace a current employee or prevent the recall of a laid-off  employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on payment. Payments to the employer may be made only  for the employer's direct expenses as a result of hiring the veteran and  generally may not exceed one-half of the wage paid to other employees in  the same or similar job. Direct expenses include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Instruction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Instructional aids;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Training materials and supplies provided to the veteran;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Minor modification of equipment to the special limitations of  the veteran;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Significant loss of productivity of the employer caused by using  the veteran as opposed to a nondisabled employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration. The period for which the employer is paid may not  exceed the period necessary to accomplish on-job   training or to begin and maintain employment at the journeyman level for  at least 2 months. The period for which payment may be authorized may  not exceed 9 months, unless the VR&E; Officer, approves a longer period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Benefits and services. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An eligible veteran on whose behalf  payments are made to the employer shall be provided all other Chapter 31  benefits and services furnished to other veterans receiving employment  services. A veteran may not be paid a subsistence allowance during the  period in which job training or work experience is furnished under this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations, if  the program in which the veteran is participating meets the criteria for  approval of on-job training under chapter 30, the veteran may be paid at  educational assistance rates provided for this type of training under  chapter 30 to the extent that he or she has remaining eligibility and  entitlement under chapter 30 and has elected to receive a subsistence  allowance in accordance with Sec. 21.7136.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3108(f), 3116(b))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Non-duplication. VA will not make payments under the provisions  of this section to an employer receiving payments from any other program  for the same training or employment expenses.
