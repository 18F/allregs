scrubber), you may request the applicable permitting authority to approve a period of planned routine maintenance for the control device needed to meet requirements in your operation, maintenance, and monitoring plan. You must present data to the applicable permitting authority demonstrating that the period of planned maintenance results in overall emissions reductions. During this pre-approved time period, the emission control device may be taken out of service while maintenance is performed on the control device and/or one of the process units while the remaining process unit(s) continue to operate. During the period the emission control device is unable to operate, the emission limits, operating limits, and monitoring requirements applicable to the unit that is operating and the wet scrubber emission control device do not apply.
