(Note: Exceptions to this requirement can be found in FAR 39.204.) After approval of the Section 508 Official or designee, the Contracting Officer may waive the requirement for offerors to provide an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, if Section 508 EIT conformance can be determined conclusively through other less formal methods. The Contracting Officer shall document in the award file any waiver for submission of the Product Assessment Template. The approval of a waiver by the Section 508 Official does not, however, eliminate the requirement for product assessment against Section 508 accessibility standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause in 352.239-73(b), Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, in contracts and orders that involve the development, acquisition, maintenance, or use of EIT products and services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, unless the EIT products and services are incidental to the project.
