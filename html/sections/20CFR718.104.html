                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A report of any physical examination conducted in connection  with a claim shall be prepared on a medical report form supplied by the  Office or in a manner containing substantially the same information. Any  such report shall include the following information and test results:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The miner's medical and employment history;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All manifestations of chronic respiratory disease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any pertinent findings not specifically listed on the form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If heart disease secondary to lung disease is found, all  symptoms and significant findings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The results of a chest X-ray conducted and interpreted as  required by Sec. 718.102; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The results of a pulmonary function test conducted and reported  as required by Sec. 718.103. If the miner is physically unable to  perform a pulmonary function test or if the test is medically  contraindicated, in the absence of evidence establishing total  disability pursuant to Sec. 718.304, the report must be based on other  medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, such  as a blood gas study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), a report of  physical examination may be based on any other procedures such as  electrocardiogram, blood-gas studies conducted and reported as required  by Sec. 718.105, and other blood analyses which, in the physician's  opinion, aid in his or her evaluation of the miner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a deceased miner, where no report is in  substantial compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b), a report prepared by  a physician who is unavailable may nevertheless form the basis for a  finding if, in the opinion of the adjudication officer, it is  accompanied by sufficient indicia of reliability in light of all  relevant evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treating physician. In weighing the medical evidence of record  relevant to whether the miner suffers, or suffered, from pneumoconiosis,  whether the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment, and  whether the miner is, or was, totally disabled by pneumoconiosis or died  due to pneumoconiosis, the adjudication officer must give consideration  to the relationship between the miner and any treating physician whose  report is admitted into the record. Specifically, the adjudication  officer shall take into consideration the following factors in weighing  the opinion of the miner's treating physician:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nature of relationship. The opinion of a physician who has  treated the miner for respiratory or pulmonary conditions is entitled to  more weight than a physician who has treated the miner for non- respiratory conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duration of relationship. The length of the treatment  relationship demonstrates whether the physician has observed the miner  long enough to obtain a superior understanding of his or her condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Frequency of treatment. The frequency of physician-patient  visits demonstrates whether the physician has observed the miner often  enough to obtain a superior understanding of his or her condition; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Extent of treatment. The types of testing and examinations  conducted during the treatment relationship demonstrate whether the  physician has obtained superior and relevant information concerning the  miner's condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the absence of contrary probative evidence, the adjudication  officer shall accept the statement of a physician with regard to the  factors listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section. In  appropriate cases, the relationship between the miner and his treating  physician may constitute substantial evidence in support of the  adjudication officer's decision to give that physician's opinion  controlling weight, provided that the weight given to the opinion of a  miner's treating physician shall also be based on the credibility of the  physician's opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation, other  relevant evidence and the record as a whole.</p>
