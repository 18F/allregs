                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An intermediary may make Microloans to any small  business eligible to receive financial assistance under this part. A  borrower may also use Microloan proceeds to establish a nonprofit child  care business. Proceeds from Microloans may be used only for working  capital and acquisition of materials, supplies, furniture, fixtures, and  equipment. SBA does not review Microloans for creditworthiness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount and maturity. Generally, Intermediaries should not make a  Microloan of more than $10,000 to any borrower. An Intermediary may not  make a Microloan of more than $20,000 unless the borrower demonstrates  that it is unable to obtain credit elsewhere at comparable interest  rates and that it has good prospects for success. An Intermediary may  not make a Microloan of more than $50,000, and no borrower may owe an  Intermediary more than $50,000 at any one time. Each Microloan must be  repaid within six years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate. The maximum interest rate that can be charged a  Microloan borrower is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On loans of more than $10,000, the interest rate charged on the  SBA loan to the Intermediary, plus 7.75 percentage points; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On loans of $10,000 or less, the interest rate charged on the  SBA loan to the Intermediary, plus 8.5 percentage points.
