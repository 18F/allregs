                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Mesh restrictions and exemptions. Vessels subject to the mesh restrictions in this paragraph (a) may not have available for immediate use any net, or any piece of net, with a mesh size smaller than that specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Butterfish fishery. Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels possessing 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) or more of butterfish harvested in or from the EEZ may only fish with nets having a minimum codend mesh of 3 inches (7.62 cm) diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, applied throughout the codend for at least 100 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net, or for codends with less than 100 meshes, the minimum mesh size codend shall be a minimum of one-third of the net, measured from the terminus of the codend to the headrope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Longfin squid fishery. Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels possessing longfin squid harvested in or from the EEZ may only fish with nets having a minimum mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm) during Trimesters I (Jan-Apr) and III (Sept-Dec), or 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) during Trimester II (May-Aug), diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, applied throughout the codend for at least 150 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net, or, for codends with less than 150 meshes, the minimum mesh size codend shall be a minimum of one-third of the net measured from the terminus of the codend to the headrope, unless their gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net obstruction or constriction. Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels fishing for and/or possessing longfin squid shall not use any device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or

chafing gear, on the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net that results in an effective mesh opening of less than 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm) during Trimesters I (Jan-Apr) and III (Sept-Dec), or 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) during Trimester II (May-Aug), diamond mesh, inside stretch measure. ``Top of the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire regulated portion of the net that would not be in contact with the ocean bottom if, during a tow, the regulated portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. However, owners or operators of otter trawl vessels fishing for and/or possessing longfin squid may use net strengtheners (covers), splitting straps, and/or bull ropes or wire around the entire circumference of the codend, provided they do not have a mesh opening of less than 5 inches (12.7 cm) diamond mesh, inside stretch measure. For the purposes of this requirement, head ropes are not to be considered part of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Jigging exemption. During closures of the longfin squid fishery resulting from the butterfish mortality cap, described in Sec. 648.26(c)(3), vessels fishing for longfin squid using jigging gear are exempt from the closure possession limit specified in Sec. 648.26(b), provided that all otter trawl gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illex fishery. Seaward of the following coordinates, connected in the order listed by straight lines except otherwise noted, otter trawl vessels possessing longfin squid harvested in or from the EEZ and fishing for Illex during the months of June, July, August, in Trimester II, and September in Trimester III are exempt from the longfin squid gear requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, provided that landward of the specified coordinates they do not have available for immediate use, as defined in Sec. 648.2, any net, or any piece of net, with a mesh size less than 1\7/8\inches (48 mm) diamond mesh in Trimester II, and 2\1/8\inches (54 mm) diamond mesh in Trimester III, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that is prohibited by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
