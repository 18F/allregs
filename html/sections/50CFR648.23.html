                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Butterfish fishery. Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels  possessing 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) or more of butterfish harvested in or from  the EEZ may only fish with nets having a minimum codend mesh of 3 inches  (7.62 cm) diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, applied throughout the  codend for at least 100 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the  net, or for codends with less than 100 meshes, the minimum mesh size  codend shall be a minimum of one-third of the net, measured from the  terminus of the codend to the headrope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Longfin squid fishery. Owners or operators of otter trawl  vessels possessing longfin squid harvested in or from the EEZ may only  fish with nets having a minimum mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm)  during Trimesters I (Jan-Apr) and III (Sept-Dec), or 1\7/8\ inches (48  mm) during Trimester II (May-Aug), diamond mesh, inside stretch measure,  applied throughout the codend for at least 150 continuous meshes forward  of the terminus of the net, or, for codends with less than 150 meshes,  the minimum mesh size codend shall be a minimum of one-third of the net  measured from the terminus of the codend to the headrope, unless their  gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in  Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net obstruction or constriction. Owners or operators of otter  trawl vessels fishing for and/or possessing longfin squid shall not use  any device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net  strengtheners, ropes, lines, or   chafing gear, on the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net that  results in an effective mesh opening of less than 2\1/8\ inches (54 mm)  during Trimesters I (Jan-Apr) and III (Sept-Dec), or 1\7/8\ inches (48  mm) during Trimester II (May-Aug), diamond mesh, inside stretch measure.  ``Top of the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the  entire regulated portion of the net that would not be in contact with  the ocean bottom if, during a tow, the regulated portion of the net were  laid flat on the ocean floor. However, owners or operators of otter  trawl vessels fishing for and/or possessing longfin squid may use net  strengtheners (covers), splitting straps, and/or bull ropes or wire  around the entire circumference of the codend, provided they do not have  a mesh opening of less than 5 inches (12.7 cm) diamond mesh, inside  stretch measure. For the purposes of this requirement, head ropes are  not to be considered part of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl  net.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Jigging exemption. During closures of the longfin squid fishery  resulting from the butterfish mortality cap, described in  Sec. 648.26(c)(3), vessels fishing for longfin squid using jigging gear  are exempt from the closure possession limit specified in  Sec. 648.26(b), provided that all otter trawl gear is stowed and not  available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Illex fishery. Seaward of the following coordinates, connected  in the order listed by straight lines except otherwise noted, otter  trawl vessels possessing longfin squid harvested in or from the EEZ and  fishing for Illex during the months of June, July, August, in Trimester  II, and September in Trimester III are exempt from the longfin squid  gear requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,  provided that landward of the specified coordinates they do not have  available for immediate use, as defined in Sec. 648.2, any net, or any  piece of net, with a mesh size less than 1\7/8\inches (48 mm) diamond  mesh in Trimester II, and 2\1/8\inches (54 mm) diamond mesh in Trimester  III, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that is  prohibited by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Point                     N. lat.
