                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Personal appearance of applicant and parent or guardian--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  When testimony may be omitted. An application may be processed without  interview if the USCIS officer adjudicating the case has in the  administrative file(s) all the required documentation necessary to  establish the applicant's eligibility for U.S. citizenship, or if the  application is accompanied by one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A Department of State Form FS-240 (Report of Birth Abroad of a  Citizen of the United States);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An unexpired United States passport issued initially for a full  five/ten-year period to the applicant as a citizen of the United States,  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant's parent(s)' naturalization certificate(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testimony required. Each applicant, when notified to do so,  shall appear in person before an officer for examination under oath or  affirmation upon the application. A person under 18 years of age must  have a parent or guardian apply, appear, and testify for the applicant,  unless one is unavailable and the district director is satisfied that  the applicant is old enough to provide reliable testimony. The same rule  will apply for incompetent applicants. At the examination the applicant  and the acting parent or guardian, if necessary, shall present testimony  and evidence pertinent to the claim to citizenship and shall have the  right to review and rebut any adverse evidence on file, and to cross- examine witnesses called by the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Witness--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Personal appearance. A witness shall be called to  testify under oath or affirmation at the discretion of USCIS only if  that person's testimony is needed to prove a particular point, and only  if alternative proof is unavailable or more difficult to produce than is  the witness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substitution and waiver. When testimony is deemed necessary by  the district director and the presentation of the person or persons  through whom citizenship is claimed is precluded by reason of death,  refusal to testify, unknown whereabouts, advanced age, mental or  physical incapacity, or severe illness or infirmity, another witness or  witnesses shall be produced. A substitute witness also may be produced  in lieu of such person if such person is a member of the United States  Armed Forces serving outside the United States in an area where his  testimony could not be taken without imposing extreme hardship upon him,  or without unduly delaying action on the application, and no issue is  present which can be resolved only by this testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proof. The burden of proof shall be upon the claimant, or his  parent or guardian if one is acting in his behalf, to establish the  claimed citizenship by a preponderance of the evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment and authority of officer. USCIS will conduct the  examination provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The  assigned officer shall have authority to administer oaths or  affirmations; to present and receive evidence; to rule upon offers of  proof; to take or cause to be taken depositions or interrogatories; to  regulate the course of the examination; to examine and cross-examine all  witnesses appearing in the proceedings; to grant or order continuances;  to consider and rule upon objections to the introduction of evidence; to  make a report and recommendation as to whether the application shall be  granted or denied, and to take such other action as may be appropriate  to the conduct of the examination and the disposition of the  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conduct of examination. The assigned officer shall, at the  commencement of the examination of the claimant or the acting parent or  guardian, advise them of their rights as set forth in paragraphs (a) and  (f) of this section, and shall interrogate them under oath or  affirmation with regard to each assertion made in the application and  any other matter pertinent to the claim to citizenship; in addition,  when a witness is deemed necessary, he shall interrogate each witness  with regard to pertinent matters within the personal knowledge of the  witness, such as the relationship between the claimant and the citizen  source or sources; the citizenship of the latter, and any possible  expatriatory acts performed by the   claimant and the citizen source or sources. He may, in his discretion,  have a transcript made of the testimony. At the conclusion of the  examination of the claimant or the action parent or guardian, all  corrections made on the applications form shall be consecutively  numbered and recorded in the space provided therefor in the form. The  affidavit shall then be signed and sworn to or affirmed by the claimant  or the acting parent or guardian; and the remainder of the affidavit  completed and signed by the assigned officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Representation during proceedings. The claimant shall have the  right to representation during the proceedings, as provided in part 292  of this chapter, and such representative shall have the right to examine  and cross-examine witnesses appearing in the proceedings; to introduce  evidence; to object to the introduction of evidence, which objections  shall be stated succinctly and entered on the record, and to submit  briefs. If the claimant is not represented by an attorney or  representative, the assigned officer shall assist him in the  introduction of all evidence available in his behalf.
