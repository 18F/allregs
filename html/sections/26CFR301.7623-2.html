                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Action. (1) In general. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term action means an administrative or judicial action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term action means an administrative or judicial action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administrative action. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term administrative action means all or a portion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) civil or criminal proceeding against any person that may result in collected proceeds, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, including, for example, an examination, a collection proceeding, a status determination proceeding, or a criminal investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Judicial action. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term judicial action means all or a portion of a proceeding against any person in any court that may result in collected proceeds, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proceeds based on. (1) In general. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS proceeds based on information provided by a whistleblower when the information provided substantially contributes to an action against a person identified by the whistleblower. For example, the IRS proceeds based on the information provided when the IRS initiates a new action, expands the scope of an ongoing action, or continues to pursue an ongoing action, that the IRS would not have initiated, expanded the scope of, or continued to pursue, but for the information provided. The IRS does not proceed based on information when the IRS analyzes the information provided or investigates a matter raised by the information provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS proceeds based on information provided by a whistleblower when the information provided substantially contributes to an action against a person identified by the whistleblower. For example, the IRS proceeds based on the information provided when the IRS initiates a new action, expands the scope of an ongoing action, or continues to pursue an ongoing action, that the IRS would not have initiated, expanded the scope of, or continued to pursue, but for the information provided. The IRS does not proceed based on information when the IRS analyzes the information provided or investigates a matter raised by the information provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's foreign sales in Country A, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer was not entitled to a foreign tax credit relating to its foreign sales in Country A. The IRS receives the information after having already initiated an examination of the taxpayer. The IRS's audit plan includes foreign tax credit issues but focuses on taxpayer's foreign sales in Country B and does not specifically address the taxpayer's foreign sales in Country A. Based on the information provided, the IRS expands the examination of the foreign tax credit issue to include consideration of the amount of foreign tax credit relating to the taxpayer's foreign sales in Country A. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the portion of the IRS's examination of the taxpayer relating to the foreign tax credit issue with respect to Country A is an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on the information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided substantially contributed to the action by causing the expansion of the IRS's examination.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer owed additional taxes in Year 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of the taxpayer for Year 1 based on the information provided by the whistleblower. The IRS discovers that the taxpayer engaged in the same activities in Year 2 and expands the examination to Year

2. In the course of the examination, the IRS obtains, through the issuance of Information Document Requests (IDRs) and summonses, additional facts that are unrelated to the activities described in the information provided by the whistleblower. Based on these additional facts, the IRS expands the scope of the examination of the taxpayer for both Year 1 and Year 2. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the portion of the IRS's examination relating to the activities described and documented in the information provided is an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided substantially contributed to the action by causing the expansion of the IRS's examination of Year 1 and Year 2. The portions of the IRS's examination of the taxpayer in both Year 1 and Year 2 relating to the additional facts obtained through the issuance of IDRs and summonses are not actions with which the IRS proceeds based on the information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided did not substantially contribute to the action.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer owed additional taxes in Year 1. The IRS receives the information after having already initiated an examination of the taxpayer for Year 1. During the examination, the information is provided to the Exam team and the Exam team uses the information provided to confirm the correctness of adjustments made based on other information. Although the whistleblower's information confirms the correctness of the IRS's adjustments, the IRS does not rely on the whistleblower's information when it makes the adjustments, nor does the information cause the IRS to expand the scope of its examination. The whistleblower's information merely supports information independently obtained by the IRS. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS's examination is not an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided did not substantially contribute to the action.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Same facts as Example 3. During the examination, however, the Exam team identifies inconsistencies between the information provided by the whistleblower and other information already in the Exam team's possession. The Exam team uses the information provided by the whistleblower to make additional adjustments that it would not have made based solely on the other information. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the portion of the IRS's examination relating to the additional adjustments is an administrative action with which the IRS proceeds based on information provided by the whistleblower because the information provided substantially contributed to the action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Related action. (1) In general. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term related action means an action against a person other than the person(s) identified in the information provided and subject to the original action(s), when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 7623(b) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term related action means an action against a person other than the person(s) identified in the information provided and subject to the original action(s), when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The facts relating to the underpayment of tax or violations of the internal revenue laws by the other person are substantially the same as the facts described and documented in the information provided (with respect to the person(s) subject to the original action);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The IRS proceeds with the action against the other person based on the specific facts described and documented in the information provided; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The other, unidentified person is related to the person identified in the information provided. For purposes of this paragraph, an unidentified person is related to the person identified in the information provided if the IRS can identify the unidentified person using the information provided (without first having to use the information provided to identify any other person or having to independently obtain additional information).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer (Taxpayer 1), describes and documents specific facts relating to Taxpayer 1's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges tax underpayments by Taxpayer 1. The information provided also identifies an accountant (CPA 1) and describes and documents specific facts relating to CPA 1's contribution to the activities of Taxpayer 1 that the whistleblower alleges resulted in tax underpayments. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 1 based on the information provided by the whistleblower. Using the information provided, the IRS obtains CPA 1's client list and identifies two taxpayer/clients of CPA 1 (Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3) that appear to

have engaged in activities similar to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 2 and finds that Taxpayer 2 engaged in the same activities as those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 3 and finds that Taxpayer 3 engaged in different activities from those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the examination of Taxpayer 2 is a related action because it satisfies the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The examination of Taxpayer 3 is not a related action because the relevant facts are not substantially the same as the facts relevant to the examination of Taxpayer 1.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Same facts as Example 1. Using the information provided by the whistleblower, the IRS identifies a co-promoter of CPA 1 (CPA 2) that appears to have engaged in activities similar to CPA 1. CPA 2 is not a member of CPA 1's firm. The IRS subsequently obtains the client list of CPA 2 and identifies a taxpayer/client of CPA 2 (Taxpayer 4) that appears to have engaged in activities similar to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 4 and finds that Taxpayer 4 engaged in the same activities as those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1, and that CPA 2 contributed to the activities in the same way as described in the information provided with respect to CPA 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of CPA 2's liability for promoter penalties under section 6700 in connection with the activities described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1 and CPA 1. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the examination of CPA 2 is a related action because it satisfies the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The examination of Taxpayer 4 is not a related action because Taxpayer 4 was not related to a person identified in the information provided. CPA 2 was not identified in the information provided and the IRS first had to identify CPA 2 before identifying Taxpayer 4 and proceeding with the examination of Taxpayer 4.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Same facts as Example 1. An accountant (CPA 3) is a member of CPA 1's firm. Using the information provided by the whistleblower, the IRS obtains the client list of CPA 3 and identifies a taxpayer/client of CPA 3 (Taxpayer 5) that appears to have engaged in activities similar to Taxpayer 1. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 5 and finds that Taxpayer 5 engaged in the same activities as those described in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1, and that CPA 3 contributed to the activities in the same way as described in the information provided with respect to CPA 1. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the examination of Taxpayer 5 is a related action because Taxpayer 5 is related to CPA 3, a person considered to be identified in the information provided under Sec. 301.7623-1(c)(1), and the facts relating to Taxpayer 5 are substantially the same as the facts described and documented in the information provided. An IRS examination of CPA 3's liability for promoter penalties under section 6700, based on the facts described and documented in the information provided with respect to Taxpayer 1 and CPA 1, is an administrative action based on the information provided.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a taxpayer (Taxpayer 1), describes and documents specific facts relating to Taxpayer 1's activities, and, in particular, Taxpayer 1's participation in a transaction. Based on those facts, the whistleblower alleges that Taxpayer 1 owed additional taxes. The IRS proceeds with an examination of Taxpayer 1 based on the information provided by the whistleblower. The IRS identifies the other parties to the transaction described in the information provided (Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3). The IRS proceeds with examinations of Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3 relating to their participation in the transaction described in the information provided. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the IRS's examinations of Taxpayer 2 and Taxpayer 3 relating to the activities described and documented in the information provided are related actions because they satisfy the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collected proceeds. (1) In general. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the terms proceeds of amounts collected and collected proceeds (collectively, collected proceeds) include: Tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts collected because of the information provided; amounts collected prior to receipt of the information if the information provided results in the denial of a claim for refund that otherwise would have been paid; and a reduction of an overpayment credit balance used to satisfy a tax liability incurred because of the information provided. Collected proceeds are limited to amounts collected under the provisions of title 26, United States Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the terms proceeds of amounts collected and collected proceeds (collectively, collected proceeds) include: Tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts collected because of the information provided; amounts collected prior to receipt of the information if the information provided results in the denial of a claim for refund that otherwise would have been paid; and a reduction of an overpayment credit balance used to satisfy a tax liability incurred because of the information provided.

If any portion of a claim for refund that is substantively unrelated to the information provided is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Allowed, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Used to satisfy a tax liability attributable to the information provided instead of refunded to the taxpayer, then the allowed but non-refunded amount constitutes collected proceeds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The provisions of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a corporate taxpayer (Corporation), describes and documents specific facts relating to Corporation's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that Corporation owed additional taxes. Based on the information provided by the whistleblower, the IRS proceeds with an examination of Corporation and determines adjustments that would result in an unpaid tax liability of $500,000. During the examination, Corporation informally claims a refund of $400,000 based on adjustments to items of income and expense that are wholly unrelated to the information provided by the whistleblower. The IRS agrees to the unrelated adjustments. The IRS nets the adjustments and determines a tax deficiency of $100,000. Thereafter, Corporation makes full payment of the $100,000 deficiency. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the collected proceeds include the $400,000 informally claimed as a refund and netted against the adjustments attributable to the information provided, as well as the $100,000 paid by Corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amended returns. Amounts collected based on amended returns constitute collected proceeds if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The IRS proceeds based on the information provided;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As a result, the person subject to the action(s) with which the IRS proceeds files amended returns; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amounts collected based on the amended returns relate to the activities or facts described in the information provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Criminal fines. Criminal fines deposited into the Crime Victims Fund are not collected proceeds and cannot be used for payment of awards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Computation of collected proceeds. (i) In general. Pursuant to Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(1), the IRS cannot make an award payment until there has been a final determination of tax. For purposes of determining the amount of an award under section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, after there has been a final determination of tax as defined in Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(2), the IRS will compute the amount of collected proceeds based on all information known with respect to the taxpayer's account, including with respect to all tax attributes, as of the date the computation is made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Pursuant to Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(1), the IRS cannot make an award payment until there has been a final determination of tax. For purposes of determining the amount of an award under section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, after there has been a final determination of tax as defined in Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(2), the IRS will compute the amount of collected proceeds based on all information known with respect to the taxpayer's account, including with respect to all tax attributes, as of the date the computation is made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Post-determination proceeds. If, based on all information known with respect to the taxpayer's account as of the date of the computation described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, there is a possibility that the IRS may collect additional proceeds, then the Whistleblower Office will continue to monitor the case. If the Whistleblower Office identifies additional collected proceeds, then the IRS will compute and pay accordingly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Partial collection. If the IRS does not collect the full amount of taxes, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts assessed against the taxpayer, then any amounts that the IRS does collect will constitute collected proceeds in the same proportion that the adjustments attributable to the information provided bear to the total adjustments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amount in dispute and gross income. (1) In general. Section 7623(b) applies with respect to any action against any taxpayer in which the tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000 but, if the taxpayer is an individual, then only if the taxpayer's gross income exceeds $200,000 in at least one taxable year subject to the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 7623(b) applies with respect to any action against any taxpayer in which the tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000 but, if the taxpayer is an individual, then only if the taxpayer's gross income exceeds $200,000 in at least one taxable year subject to the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amount in dispute. (i) In general. For purposes of section 7623(b)(5) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term amount in dispute means the greater of the maximum total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action(s) with which the IRS proceeded based on the information provided, or the maximum total of such amounts that were stated in formal positions taken by the IRS in the action(s). The IRS will compute the amount in dispute, for purposes of award determinations described in Sec. 301.7623-3(c)(6), when there has been a final determination of tax as defined in Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 7623(b)(5) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term amount in dispute means the greater of the maximum total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action(s) with which the IRS proceeded based on the information provided, or the maximum total of such amounts that were stated in formal positions taken by the IRS in the action(s). The IRS will compute the amount in dispute, for purposes of award determinations described in Sec. 301.7623-3(c)(6), when there has been a final determination of tax as defined in Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Information provided to the IRS by a whistleblower, under section 7623 and Sec. 301.7623-1, identifies a corporate taxpayer, describes and documents specific facts relating to the taxpayer's activities, and, based on those facts, alleges that the taxpayer owed additional taxes. The IRS proceeds with an examination of the taxpayer based on the information provided by the whistleblower; makes adjustments to items of income and expense and allows certain credits; and, ultimately, determines a deficiency against the taxpayer of $1,900,000 and issues the taxpayer a statutory notice of deficiency. The taxpayer petitions the notice to the United States Tax Court. The Tax Court sustains the IRS's position resulting in a deficiency of $1,900,000. Following the final determination of tax, the IRS computes that the total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action was $2,500,000. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the amount in dispute is $2,500,000.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except the IRS determines a deficiency of $1,500,000; the Tax Court sustains the deficiency of $1,500,000; and, following the final determination of tax, the IRS computes that the total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action was $1,750,000. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the amount in dispute is $1,750,000.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Same facts as Example 1, except the IRS determines a deficiency of $2,100,000; the Tax Court redetermines a deficiency of $1,500,000; and, following the final determination of tax, the IRS computes that the total of tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts that resulted from the action was $1,750,000. For purposes of section 7623 and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the amount in dispute is $2,100,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gross income. For purposes of section 7623(b)(5) and Sec. Sec. 301.7623-1 through 301.7623-4, the term gross income has the same meaning as provided under section 61(a). The IRS will compute the individual taxpayer's gross income, for purposes of award determinations described in Sec. 301.7623-3(c)(6), when there has been a final determination of tax as defined in Sec. 301.7623-4(d)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This rule is effective on August 12, 2014. This rule applies to information submitted on or after August 12, 2014, and to claims for award under sections 7623(a) and 7623(b) that are open as of August 12, 2014.
