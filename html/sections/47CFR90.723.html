The existing Phase I station's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall be calculated using the F(50,50) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential. The 10 dB protection to the existing Phase I station's predicted 38 dBu signal level contour shall be calculated using the F(50,10) field strength chart for Channels 7-13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10a) of this chapter,

with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential.
