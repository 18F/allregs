It should be  conducted to a level of detail necessary to demonstrate compliance with  applicable requirements and should follow standard qualitative analysis  procedures. Assumptions, operating conditions considered, failures  considered, cause and effect relationships, how failures are detected by  the crew, alternatives available to the crew, and possible design  verification tests necessary should be included. Questions regarding  failure analysis should be referred to the Marine Safety Center at an  early stage of design.
