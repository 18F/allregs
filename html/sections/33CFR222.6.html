                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This regulation states objectives, assigns  responsibilities and prescribes procedures for implementation of a  National Program for Inspection of Non-Federal Dams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. This regulation is applicable to all Divisions  and Districts having Civil Works functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> References. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The National Dam Inspection Act, Pub. L. 92-367,  8 August 1972.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Freedom of Information Act, Pub.

The National Dam Inspection Act, Public Law 92-367, 8  August 1972 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the  Chief of Engineers, to carry out a national program of inspection of  non-Federal dams for the purpose of protecting human life and property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Scope. The program provides for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An update of the National Inventory of Dams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inspection of the following non-Federal dams (the indicated  hazard potential categories are based upon the location of the dams  relative to developed areas):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dams which are in the high hazard potential category (located on  Federal and non-Federal lands).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dams in the significant hazard potential category believed by  the State to represent an immediate danger to the public safety due to  the actual condition of the dam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dams in the significant hazard potential category located on  Federal lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specifically excluded from the national inspection program are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dams under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation, the  Tennessee Valley Authority, the International Boundary and Water  Commission and the Corps of Engineers and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dams which have been constructed pursuant to licenses issued  under the authority of the Federal Power Act, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Dams which have been inspected within the 12-month period  immediately prior to the enactment of this act by a State agency and  which the Governor of such State requests be excluded from inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Objectives. The objectives of the program are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To update the National Inventory of Dams by 30 September 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To perform the initial technical inspection and evaluation of  the non-Federal dams described in paragraph 222.8(e) of this section to  identify conditions which constitute a danger to human life or property  as a means of expediting the correction of hazardous conditions by non- Federal interests. The inspection and evaluation is to be completed by  30 September 1981.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To obtain additional information and experience that may be  useful in determining if further Federal actions are necessary to assure  national dam safety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Encourage the States to establish effective dam safety programs  for non-Federal dams by 30 September 1981 and assist the States in the  development of the technical capability to carry out such a program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Program execution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Responsibilities. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner has the  basic legal responsibility for potential hazards created by their  dam(s). Phase II studies, as described in Chapter 4, Appendix D, and  remedial actions are the owner's responsibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State has the basic responsibility for the protection of  the life and property of its citizens. Once a dam has been determined to  be unsafe, it is the State's responsibility to see that timely remedial  actions are taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Corps of Engineers has the responsibility for executing  the national program. The Federal program for inspection of dams does  not modify the basic responsibilities of the States or dam owners. The  Engineering Division of the Civil Works Directorate is responsible for  overall program goals, guidance, technical criteria for inspections and  inventory and headquarters level coordination with other agencies. The  Water Resources Support Center (WRSC) located at Kingman Building, Fort  Belvoir, Virginia 22060 is responsible for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Program Coordination of both the inventory and inspection  programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Developing and defining functional tasks to achieve program  objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Determining resource requirements. (Budget)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Compiling and disseminating progress reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Monitoring and evaluating program progress and recommending  corrective measures as needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Collecting and evaluating data pertaining to inspection reports,  dam owners' responses to inspection report   recommendations, attitudes and capabilities of State officials, State  dam safety legislation, Architect-Engineer performance, etc., for  defining a comprehensive national dam safety program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Responding to Congressional, media, scientific and engineering  organization and general public inquiries.  Division and District offices are responsible for executing the program  at the State level. Assignment of Division reponsibilities for States is  shown in Appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State participation. Where State capability exists, every effort  should be made to encourage the State to execute the inspection program  either with State personnel or with Architect-Engineer (A-E) contracts  under State supervision. If the State does not have the capability to  carry out the inspection program, the program will be managed by the  Corps of Engineers utilizing Corps employees or contracts with A-E firm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Update of National Inventory of Dams.

Also, when available, personnel of other  appropriate Federal agencies should be utilized for the inventory work  on a reimbursable basis. Work in any State may be accomplished:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under State supervision utilizing State personnel or Architect- Engineers contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Corps supervision utilizing Corps employees, employees of  other Federal agencies or Architect-Engineer contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A minimum staff should be assigned in Districts and Divisions to  administer and monitor the inventory activities. Generally, the work  should be accomplished by architect-engineers or other Federal agency  personnel under State or Corps supervision. Corps personnel should  participate in the inventory only to the extent needed to assure that  accurate data are collected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The National Inventory of Dams computerized data base in stored  on the Boeing Computer Services (BCS) EKS computer system in Seattle,  Washington. The data base uses Data Base Management System 2000 and is  accessible for query by all Corps offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Appendix B indicates details on accessing and updating inventory  data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Appendix I describes the procedure for using NASA Land Satellite  (LANDSAT) Multispectral Scanner   data along with NASA's Surface Water Detection and Mapping (DAM)  computer program to assist in updating and verifying and National  Inventory of Dams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All inventory data for dams will be completed and verified  utilizing all available sources of information (including LANDSAT  overlay maps) and will include site visitation if required. It is the  responsibility of the District Engineer to insure that the inventory of  each State within his area of responsibility is accurate and contains  the information required by the General Instructions for completing the  forms for each Federal and non-Federal dam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Inspection Program. (RCS-DAEN-CWE-17 and OMB No. 49-RO421)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scheduling of inspections. The Governor of each State or his  designee will continue to be involved in the selection and scheduling of  the dams to be inspected. Priority will be given to inspection of those  dams considered to offer the greatest potential threat to public safety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No inspection of a dam should be initiated until the hazard  potential classification of the dam has been verified to the  satisfaction of the Corps. Dams in the significant hazard category  should be inspected only if requested by the State and only then if the  State can provide information to show that the dam has deficiencies that  pose an immediate danger to the public safety. Guidance for the  selection of significant category non-Federal dams on Federal lands will  be given in the near future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Selection for inspection of non-Federal dams located on Federal  lands or non-Federal dams designed and constructed under the  jurisdiction of some Federal agency, should be coordinated with the  responsible Federal agency. The appropriate State or regional  representative of the Federal agency also should be contacted to obtain  all available data on the dam. Representatives of the agency may  participate in the inspection if they desire and should be given the  opportunity to review and comment on the findings and recommendations in  the inspection report prior to submission to the Governor and the dam  owner. Examples of such dams are: non-Federal dams built on lands  managed by National Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and  Wildlife Service, etc.; non-Federal dams designed and constructed by the  Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture; high  hazard mine tailings and coal mine waste dams under the jurisdiction of  the Mine Safety and Health Administration, Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Indian-owned dams on trust lands are considered to be non- Federal dams. All dams in the high hazard potential category will be  inspected. Privately-owned dams located on Indian lands are to be  included in the program, however BIA-owned dams on Indian lands are  Federal dams and are exempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures. The Division Engineer is responsible for the quality  of inspections and reports prepared by the District Engineer. Close  liaison between the District Engineer and the State agency or A-E firm  responsible for the inspections will be required in order to obtain a  dependable result. To avoid undesirable delays in the evaluation of  safety of individual dams, contracts with A-E's or agreements with  States which are managing the program will provide that reports be  completed and furnished to the District Engineer within a specified time  after completion of the on-site inspection of the dam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inspection guidelines. The inspection should be conducted in  accordance with the Recommended Guidelines for Safety Inspection of Dams  (Appendix D to this section). Expanded Guidance for Hydrologic and  Hydraulic Assessment of Dams is provided in Appendix C. The criteria in  the recommended guidelines are screening criteria to be used only for  initial determinations of the adequacy of the dam. Conditions found  during the investigation which do not meet the guideline recommendations  should be assessed as to their importance from the standpoint of the  degree of risk involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Coordinators. Experience has shown that coordination and  communications among technical disciplines, Public Affairs Office,  emergency officials, training officers, operations personnel, State  representatives and A-E   firms has been best in those districts where one person was delegated  the responsiblity for coordinating the actions of all involved elements.  Each district should evaluate its overall coordination procedures to  insure that all involved elements have the best possible access to  necessary data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Field investigations should be carried out in a systematic  manner. A detailed checklist or inspection form should be developed and  used for each dam inspection and appended to the inspection report. The  size of the field inspection team should be as small as practicable,  generally consisting of only one representative of each required  discipline in order to control the costs of the inspection without  sacrificing the quality of the inspection. The inspection team for the  smaller less complex dams should be limited to two or three  representatives from appropriate technical areas with additional  specialists used only as special conditions warrant. The larger more  complex projects may require inspection teams of three or four  specialists. Performance of overly detailed and precise surveys and  mapping should be avoided. Necessary measurement of spillway, dam  slopes, etc. can generally be made with measuring tapes and hand levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional engineering studies. Dam inspections should be  limited to Phase I investigations as outlined in Chapter 3 of Appendix  D. However, if recommended by the investigating engineer and approved by  the District Engineer, some additional inexpensive investigations may be  performed when a reasonable judgment on the safety of the dam cannot be  made without additional investigation. Any further Phase II  investigation needed to prove or disprove the findings of the District  Engineer or to devise remedial measures to correct deficiencies are the  responsibility of the owner and will not be undertaken by the Corps of  Engineers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assessment of the investigation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The findings of the visual  inspection and review of existing engineering data for a dam shall be  assessed to determine its general condition. Dams assessed to be in  generally good condition should be so described in the inspection  report. Deficiencies found in a dam should be described and assessed as  to the degree of risk they present. The degree of risk should consider  only loss of life and/or property damage resulting from flooding due to  dam failure. Loss of project benefits i.e., municipal water supply,  etc., should not be considered. If deficiencies are assessed to be of  such a nature that, if not corrected, they could result in the failure  of the dam with subsequent loss of life and/or substantial property  damage, the dam should be assessed as ``Unsafe.'' If the probable  failure of an ``Unsafe'' dam is judged to be imminent and immediate  action is required to reduce or eliminate the hazard, the ``unsafe''  condition of the dam should be considered an ``emergency.'' If the  probable failure is judged not to be imminent, the ``unsafe'' condition  should be considered a ``non-emergency.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adequacy of spillway. The ``Recommended Guidelines for Safety  Inspection of Dams,'' Appendix D, provide current, acceptable inspection  standards for spillway capacity. Any spillway capacity that does not  meet the criteria in the ``Guidelines'' is considered inadequate. When a  spillway's capacity is so deficient that it is seriously inadequate, the  project must be considered unsafe. If all of the following conditions  prevail, the Governor of the State shall be informed that such project  is unsafe:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is high hazard to loss of life from large flows downstream  of the dam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dam failure resulting from overtopping would significantly  increase the hazard to loss of life downstream from the dam over that  which would exist just before overtopping failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The spillway is not capable of passing one-half of the probable  maximum flood without overtopping the dam and causing failure.  Classification of dams with seriously inadequate spillways as ``unsafe,  non-emergency'' is generally a proper designation of the urgency of the  unsafe condition. However, there may be cases where the spillway  capacity is unusually small and the consequences of dam overtopping and  failure would be catastrophic. In such cases, the unsafe dam should be  classified as an emergency situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All inspection reports will receive one level of independent  review by the Corps. If the reports are prepared by the Corps, the  independent review may be performed internally within the district  office. However, in cases which involve significant economic, social or  political impacts and technical uncertainties in evaluating the dams,  advice may be obtained from the staffs of the Division Engineer and the  Office, Chief of Engineers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reports--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preparation. A written report on the condition of  each dam should be prepared as soon as possible after the completion of  the field inspection and assessment. A suggested report format is  attached as Appendix E. It is important that the inspection report be  completed in a timely manner. For inspections being done by Corps  employees, it is suggested that once an inspection team has been  assigned to a dam inspection it be allowed to complete the inspection  and report without interruption by other work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Review and approval. The coordinating engineer should determine  which disciplines should review the report and establish a procedure to  accomplish the review in a timely manner. A review panel, made up of the  appropriate Division and Branch Chiefs has worked well in some  districts. Use of a review panel should be seriously considered by all  districts. All inspection reports shall be approved by the District  Engineer who will maintain a complete file of final approved reports.  Any State or Federal agency having jurisdiction over the dam or the land  on which the dam is built should be given the opportunity to review and  comment on the report prior to submission to the Governor or dam owner.  The District Engineer will transmit final approved reports to the  Governor of the State and the dam owner (or the Governor only, when  requested in writing by State officials). If the report is initially  furnished to the Governor only, a period of up to ten days may be  allowed before the report is furnished to the dam owner. If the Governor  or the owner indicates additional technical information is available  that might affect the assessment of the dam's condition, the District  Engineer will furnish the proposed final report to the Governor and the  owner and establish a definite time period for comments to be furnished  to the District Engineer prior to report approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In general the Governor will be responsible for public release  of an inspection report and for initiating any public Statements.  However, an approved report must be treated as any other document  subject to release upon request under the Freedom of Information Act.  The letters of transmittal to the Governor and owner should indicate  that under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the  documents will be subject to release upon request after receipt by the  Governor. Proposed final reports will be considered as internal working  papers not subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act.  Corps personnel, A-E contractor personnel and others working under  supervision of the Corps will be cautioned to avoid public statements  about the condition of the dam until after the District Engineer has  approved the report. The Corps will respond fully to inquiries after the  Governor has received the approved report or been notified of an unsafe  dam. An information copy of the report should be sent to the District  office normally having jurisdiction if other than the District  responsible for the inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Follow-up action. A Federal investment of the magnitude  anticipated for this inspection program makes it desirable that a  reporting system be established to keep the District Engineer abreast of  the implementation of the recommendations in the inspection reports. The  letters of transmittal to the Governor and owner will request that the  District Engineer be informed of the actions taken on the  recommendations in the inspection reports. However, the National Dam  Inspection Act only authorizes the initial inspection of certain dams;  therefore, once a report is completed no reinspection will be  undertaken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Unsafe dams. The investigating engineer will be required to  immediately notify the District Engineer when a dam is assessed as being  unsafe. He will also indicate if probable failure of the unsafe dam is  judged to be imminent   and immediate action is required to reduce or eliminate the threat. The  District Engineer will evaluate the findings of the investigating team  and will immediately notify the Governor and the owner if the findings  are Unsafe Non-Emergency or Unsafe-Emergency. The appropriate State  agency and the Corps of Engineers officials having emergency operation  responsibility for the area in which the dam is located will also be  notified. The information provided in the unsafe dam notice shall be as  indicated in Appendix F. Any emergency procedures or remedial actions  deemed necessary by the District Engineer will be recommended to the  Governor who has the responsibility for any corrective actions. As  provided in ER 500-1-1, Corps assistance under Pub. L. 84-99 ``Advance  Measures,'' may be made available to complement the owner's and  Governor's action under certain conditions and subject to the approval  of the Director of Civil Works. The District Engineer's Emergency  Operation Officer will coordinate the advance measures request in  accordance with existing procedures. Coordination will be maintained  between the District responsible for emergency action under Pub. L. 84- 90 and the District responsible for the inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emergency action plans. An emergency action plan should be  available for every dam in the high and significant hazard category.  Such plans should outline actions to be taken by the operator to  minimize downstream effects of an emergency and should include an  effective warning system. If an emergency action plan has not been  developed, the inspection report should recommend that the owner develop  such an action plan. However, the Corps has no authority to require an  emergency action plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Progress reports. Progress reports should be submitted monthly  by the Division Engineer to WRSC. The reports shall include progress  through the last Saturday of the month and should be mailed by the  following Monday. The reports shall contain the information and be  typewritten in the format shown in Appendix G. Copies of Unsafe Dam Data  Sheets will be submitted with the progress report. Copies of the  completed inspection report for Dams in the Unsafe-Emergency category  will be submitted also. (RCS-DAEN-CWE-19)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Contracts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Corps of Engineers supervision. Contracts for  performing inventory and inspection activities under supervision of the  Corps of Engineers shall be Fixed-Price Architect Engineer Contracts for  Services. A sample scope of work setting forth requirements is provided  in Appendix H. Experience has shown that costs for individual dam  inspection have been lower when multiple inspections are included in one  contract. Therefore, each A-E contract should include multiple dam  inspections where practicable. Corps participation in A-E inspections  should be held to a minimum. Corps representatives should participate in  only enough A-E inspections to assure the equality of the inspections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State supervision. Contracts with States for performing  inventory and inspection activities under State supervision may be  either a Cost-Reimbursement type A-E Contract for Services or a Fixed- Price type contract. The selection of Architect-Engineers by the State  should require approval of the Corps of Engineers Contracting Officer.  The negotiated price for A-E services under cost-reimbursement type  contracts with States will also require approval by the Contracting  Officer. Contracts with States should require timely submission of the  inspection reports to the District Engineer for review and approval. The  contract provisions should also prevent public release of or public  comment on the inspection report until the District Engineer has  reviewed and approved the report. Corps of Engineers participation in  State inspections should be limited to occasional selected inspections  to assure the quality of the State program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Training. As indicated in paragraph (f) of this section, one  objective of the inspection program for non-Federal Dams is to prepare  the States to provide effective dam safety programs. In many States this  will require training of personnel of State agencies in the technical  aspects of dam inspections. The Office, Chief of Engineers is studying  the need for and content of a   comprehensive Corps-sponsored training program in dam inspection  technology. Pending the possible adoption of such a comprehensive plan,  division and district Engineers are encouraged to take advantage of  suitable opportunities to provide needed training in dam safety  activities to qualified employees of State agencies and, when  appropriate, to employees of architect-engineer firms engaged in the  program. The following general considerations should be observed in  providing such training:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Priority must be placed on inspection of dams and updating the  national dam inventory; hence, diversion of resources to training  activities should not deter or delay these principle program functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Salaries, per diem and travel expenses relating to training  activities of State employees will be a State expense. There will be no  tuition charge for State employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Architect-Engineer firms will be required to pay expenses and  tuition costs for their employees participating in Corps-sponsored  training activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Corps-sponsored training will require that each trainee is a  qualified engineer or geologist and will concentrate on engineering  technology related directly to dam safety. (This may require screening  of proposed candidates for training.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Under this program, the Corps will not sponsor training that is  intended primarily to satisfy requirements for a degree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Training by participation in actual dam inspections and/or  management of the inspection program should be encouraged.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix A to Sec. 222.6--Division Assignments</p><p class="depth0">To facilitate better coordination with the States, the Division  Engineers are responsible for the dam inspection program by States as  follows:  New England Division: Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New  Hampshire, Massachusetts North Atlantic Division: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,  Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia Ohio River Division: West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana South Atlantic Division: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,  Florida, Alabama, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands Lower Mississippi Valley Division: Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri North Central Division: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa Southwestern Division: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico Missouri River Division: Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota,  Wyoming, Colorado North Pacific Division: Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Washington, Alaska South Pacific Division: Utah, California, Arizona, Nevada Pacific Ocean Division: Hawaii, Trust Territories, American Samoa</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B to Sec. 222.6--Inventory of Dams</p><p class="depth0">(RCS-DAEN-CWE-17 and OMB No. 49-RO421)</p><p class="depth0">1.

Phase I inspections are not intended to provide detailed  hydrologic and hydraulic analyses of dam and reservoir capabilities.  However, when such analyses are available, they should be evaluated for  reliability and completeness. If a project's ability to pass the  appropriate flood (see Table 3, page D-12 of Recommended Guidelines) can  be determined from available information of a brief study, such an  assessment should be made. It should be noted that hydrologic and  hydraulic analyses connected with the Phase I inspections should be  based on approximate methods or systematized computer programs that take  minimal effort. The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) has developed a  special computer program for hydrologic and hydraulic analyses to be  used with the Phase I inspection program. Other Field Operating Agencies  have developed similar computer programs or generalized procedures which  are acceptable for use. All such efforts should be completed with  minimum resources.</p><p class="depth0">2. A finding that a dam will not safely pass the flood indicated in  the Recommended Guidelines does not necessarily indicate that the dam  should be classified as unsafe. The degree of inadequacy of the spillway  to pass the appropriate flood and the probable adverse impacts of dam  failure because of overtopping must be considered in making such  classification. The following criteria have   been selected which indicate when spillway capacity is so seriously  inadequate that a project must be classified as unsafe. All of the  following conditions must prevail before designating a dam unsafe:</p><p class="depth0">a. There is high hazard to loss of life from large flows downstream  of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">b. Dam failure resulting from overtopping would significantly  increase the hazard to loss of life downstream from the dam from that  which would exist just before overtopping failure.</p><p class="depth0">c. The spillway is not capable of passing one-half of the probable  maximum flood without overtopping the dam and causing failure.</p><p class="depth0">3. The above criteria are generally adequate for evaluating most  non-Federal dams. However, in a few cases the increased hazard potential  from overtopping and failure is so great as to result in catastrophic  consequences. In such cases, the evaluation of condition 2c should  utilize a flood more closely approximating the full probable maximum  flood rather than one-half the flood. An example of such a situation  would be a large dam immediately above a highly populated flood plain,  with little likelihood of time for evacuation in the event of an  emergency.</p><p class="depth0">4. Conditions 2a and 2b require an approximation of housing location  in relation to flooded areas. Resources available in Phase I inspections  do not permit detailed surveys or time-consuming studies to develop such  relationships. Therefore, rough estimates will generally be made from  data obtained during the inspection and from readily available maps and  drawings. Brief computer routings such as the HEC-1 dam break analysis,  using available data, are recommended in marginal cases. The HEC-1, dam  break version, is available on the Boeing Computer Services or may be  obtained from the Hydrologic Engineering Center, Davis, California.  Available resources do not permit detailed studies or investigations to  establish the amount of overtopping that would cause a dam to fail, as  designated in condition 2c. Professional judgment and available  information will have to be used in these determinations. When detailed  investigations and studies are required to make a reasonable judgment of  the conditions which designate an unsafe dam, the inspection report  should recommend that such studies be the responsibility of the dam  owner.</p><p class="depth0">5. During the inspection of a dam, consideration should be given to  impacts on other dams located downstream from the project being  inspected. When failure of a dam would be likely to cause failure of  another dam(s) downstream, its designation as an unsafe dam could result  in multiple impacts. Therefore, the information should be explicitly  described in the inspection report. Such information may be vital to the  priorities established by State Governors for dam improvements.  Similarly, when the failure of an upstream dam (classified as unsafe)  could cause failure of the dam being inspected, this information should  be prominently displayed in the inspection report.</p><p class="depth0">6. The criteria established in paragraph 2 for designating unsafe  dams because of seriously inadequate spillways are considered reasonable  and prudent. They provide a consistent bases for declaring unsafe dams  and also serve as an effective compromise between the Recommended  Guidelines and unduly low standards suggested by special interests and  individuals unfamiliar with flood hazard potential.</p><p class="depth0">7. The Hydrometeorological Branch (HMB) of the National Weather  Service has reviewed some 500 experienced large storms in the United  States. The purpose of the review was to ascertain the relative  magnitude of experienced large storms to probable maximum precipitation  (PMP) and their distribution throughout the country. Their review  reveals that about 25 percent of the major storms have exceeded 50  percent of the probable maximum precipitation for one or more  combinations of area and duration. In fact some storms have very closely  approximated the PMP values. Exhibits C-1 thru C-5 indicate locations  where experienced storms have exceeded 50 percent of the PMP.</p><p class="depth0">8. There are several options to consider when selecting mitigation  measures to avoid severe consequences of a dam failure from overtopping.  The following measures may be required by a Governor when sufficient  legal authority is available under State laws and a dam presents a  serious threat to loss of life.</p><p class="depth0">a. Remove the dam.</p><p class="depth0">b. Increase the height of dam and/or spillway size to pass the  probable maximum flood without overtopping the dam.</p><p class="depth0">c. Purchase downstream land that would be adversely impacted by dam  failure and restrict human occupancy.</p><p class="depth0">d. Enhance the stability of the dam to permit overtopping by the  probable maximum flood without failure.</p><p class="depth0">e. Provide a highly reliable flood warning system (generally does  not prevent damage but avoids loss of life).

The establishment of  rigid criteria or standards is not intended. Safety must be evaluated in  the light of peculiarities and local conditions at a particular dam and  in recognition of the many factors involved, some of which may not be  precisely known. This can only be done by competent, experienced  engineering judgment, which the guidelines are intended to supplement  and not supplant. The guidelines are intended to be flexible, and the  proper flexibility must be achieved through the employment of  experienced engineering personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Conditions found during the investigation which do not meet  guideline recommendations should be assessed by the investigator as to  their import from the standpoint of the involved degree of risk. Many  deviations will not compromise project safety and the investigator is  expected to identify them in this manner if that is the case. Others  will involve various degrees of risk, the proper evaluation of which  will afford a basis for priority of subsequent attention and possible  remedial action.</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines present procedures for investigating and evaluating  existing conditions for the purpose of identifying deficiencies and  hazardous conditions. The two phases of investigation outlined in the  guidelines are expected to accomplish only this and do not encompass in  scope the engineering which will be required to perform the design  studies for corrective modification work.</p><p class="depth0">It is recognized that some States may have established or will adopt  inspection criteria incongruous in some respects with these guidelines.  In such instances assessments of project safety should recognize the  State's requirements as well as guideline recommendations.</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines were developed with the help of several Federal  agencies and many State agencies, professional engineering  organizations, and private engineers. In reviewing two drafts of the  guidelines they have contributed many helpful suggestions. Their  contributions are deeply appreciated and have made it possible to evolve  a document representing a consensus of the engineering fraternity. As  experience is gained with use of the guidelines, suggestions for future  revisions will be generated. All such suggestions should be directed to  the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, DAEN-CWE-D, Washington, D.C. 20314.</p><p class="depth0">Recommended Guidelines for Safety Inspection of Dams</p><p class="depth0">Table of Contents</p><p class="depth0">Preface</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 1--Introduction  Para. 1.1 Purpose. 1.2 Applicability. 1.3 Authority.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 2--General Requirements  2.1 Classification of dams. 2.1.1 Size. 2.1.2 Hazard potential. 2.2 Selection of dams to be investigated. 2.3 Technical investigations. 2.4 Qualifications of investigators. 2.5 Reports.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 3--Phase I Investigation  3.1 Purpose. 3.2 Scope. 3.3 Engineering data. 3.4 Field inspections. 3.5 Evaluation of hydraulic and hydrologic features. 3.5.1 Design data. 3.5.2 Experience data. 3.6 Evaluation of structural stability. 3.6.1 Design and construction data. 3.6.2 Operating records. 3.6.3 Post contruction changes. 3.6.4 Seismic stability.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 4--Phase II Investigation  4.1 Purpose. 4.2 Scope. 4.3 Hydraulic and hydrologic analysis. 4.3.1 Maximum water surface based on SDF peak inflow. 4.3.1.1 Peak for 100-year flood. 4.3.1.2 Peak for PMF or fraction thereof. 4.3.2 Maximum water surface based on SDF hydrograph. 4.3.3 Acceptable procedures. 4.3.4 Freeboard allowances. 4.4 Stability investigations. 4.4.1 Foundation and material investigations. 4.4.2 Stability assessment. 4.4.2.1 Seismic stability. 4.4.2.2 Clay shale foundation. 4.4.3 Embankment dams. 4.4.3.1 Liquefaction. 4.4.3.2 Shear failure. 4.4.3.3 Loading conditions. 4.4.3.4 Safety factors. 4.4.3.5 Seepage failure. 4.4.3.6 Seepage analyses.   4.4.4 Concrete dams and appurtenant structures. 4.4.4.1 Requirements for stability. 4.4.4.2 Loads. 4.4.4.3 Stresses. 4.4.4.4 Overturning. 4.4.4.5 Sliding. 4.4.4.5.1 Sliding resistance. 4.4.4.5.2 Downstream resistance. 4.4.4.5.3 Safety factor.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 5--Reports  5.1 General. 5.2 Preparation of report. 5.2.1 Phase I reports. 5.2.2 Phase II reports.</p><p class="depth0">Tables  Table 1 Size classification. 2 Hazard potential classification. 3 Hydrologic evaluation guidelines. 4 Factors of safety (embankment dams).</p><p class="depth0">Figures  Fig. 1 Seismic zone map of contiguous States. 2 Seismic zone map of California, Nevada and Arizona. 3 Seismic zone map of Alaska. 4 Seismic zone map of Hawaii. 5 Design envelope for Case I (Table 4). 6 Design envelope for Cases II and III (Table 4).</p><p class="depth0">Appendixes  Appendix I to App. D--Engineering data Appendix II to App. D--Inspection items Appendix III to App. D--Pub.

This document provides recommended guidelines for the  inspection and evaluation of dams to determine if they constitute  hazards to human life or property.</p><p class="depth0">1.2. Applicability. The procedures and guidelines outlined in this  document apply to the inspection and evaluation of all dams as defined  in the National Dam Inspection Act, Public Law 92-367. Included in this  program are all artificial barriers together with appurtenant works  which impound or divert water and which (1) are twenty-five feet or more  in height or (2) have an impounding capacity of fifty acre-feet or more.  Not included are barriers which are six feet or less in height,  regardless of storage capacity, or barriers which have a storage  capacity at maximum water storage elevation of fifteen acre-feet or less  regardless of height.</p><p class="depth0">1.3. Authority. The Dam Inspection Act, Public Law 92-367 (Appendix  III), authorized the Secretary of the Army, through the Corps of  Engineers, to initiate a program of safety inspection of dams throughout  the United States. The Chief of Engineers issues these guidelines  pursuant to that authority.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 2--General Requirements</p><p class="depth0">2.1. Classification of dams. Dams should be classified in accordance  with size and hazard potential in order to formulate a priority basis  for selecting dams to be included in the inspection program and also to  provide compatibility between guideline requirements and involved risks.  When possible the initial classifications should be based upon  information listed in the National Inventory of Dams with respect to  size, impoundment capacity and hazard potential. It may be necessary to  reclassify dams when additional information becomes available.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1. Size. The classification for size based on the height of the  dam and storage capacity should be in accordance with Table 1. The  height of the dam is established with respect to the maximum storage  potential measured from the natural bed of the stream or watercourse at  the downstream toe of the barrier, or if it is not across a stream or  watercourse, the height from the lowest elevation of the outside limit  of the barrier, to the maximum water storage elevation. For the purpose  of determining project size, the maximum storage elevation may be  considered equal to the top of dam elevation. Size classification may be  determined by either storage or height, whichever gives the larger size  category.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Size Classification ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Impoundment</p><p class="depth0">Category             ---------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Storage (ac-ft)       Height (ft) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Small...........................  <1,000 and "50....  <40 and "25.

"100. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2. Hazard Potential. The classification for potential hazards  should be in accordance with Table 2. The hazards pertain to potential  loss of human life or property damage in the area downstream of the dam  in event of failure or misoperation of the dam or appurtenant  facilities. Dams conforming to criteria for the low hazard potential  category generally will be located in rural or agricultural areas where  failure may damage farm buildings, limited agricultural land, or  township and country roads. Significant hazard potential category  structures will be those located in predominantly rural or agricultural  areas where failure may damage isolated homes, secondary highways or  minor railroads or cause interruption of use or service of relatively  important public utilities. Dams in the high hazard potential category  will be those located where failure may cause serious damage to homes,  extensive agricultural, industrial and commercial facilities, important  public utilities, main highways, or railroads.</p><p class="depth0">Table 2--Hazard Potential Classification ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Loss of life (extent of             Economic loss (extent of</p><p class="depth0">Category                             development)                        development) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Low....................................

High...................................  More than few......................  Excessive (Extensive community,</p><p class="depth0">industry or agriculture). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">2.2. Selection of dams to be investigated. The selection of dams to  be investigated should be based upon an assessment of existing  developments in flood hazard areas. Those dams possessing a hazard  potential classified high or significant as indicated in Table 2 should  be given first and second priorities, respectively, in the inspection  program. Inspection priorities within each category may be developed  from a consideration of factors such as size classification and age of  the dam, the population size in the downstream flood area, and potential  developments anticipated in flood hazard areas.</p><p class="depth0">2.3. Technical Investigations. A detailed, systematic, technical  inspection and evaluation should be made of each dam selected for  investigation in which the hydraulic and hydrologic capabilities,  structural stability and operational adequacy of project features are  analyzed and evaluated to determine if the dam constitutes a danger to  human life or property. The investigation should vary in scope and  completeness depending upon the availability and suitability of  engineering data, the validity of design assumptions and analyses and  the condition of the dam. The minimum investigation will be designated  Phase I, and an in-depth investigation designated Phase II should be  made where deemed necessary. Phase I investigations should consist of a  visual inspection of the dam, abutments and critical appurtenant  structures, and a review of readily available engineering data. It is  not intended to perform costly explorations or analyses during Phase I.  Phase II investigations should consist of all additional engineering  investigations and analyses found necessary by results of the Phase I  investigation.</p><p class="depth0">2.4. Qualifications of investigators. The technical investigations  should be conducted under the direction of licensed professional  engineers experienced in the investigation, design, construction and  operation of dams, applying the disciplines of hydrologic, hydraulic,  soils and structural engineering and engineering geology. All field  inspections should be conducted by qualified engineers, engineering  geologists and other specialists, including experts on mechanical and  electrical operation of gates and controls, knowledgeable in the  investigation, design, construction and operation of dams.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 3--Phase I Investigation</p><p class="depth0">3.1. Purpose. The primary purpose of the Phase I investigation  program is to identify expeditiously those dams which may pose hazards  to human life or property.</p><p class="depth0">3.2. Scope. The Phase I investigation will develop an assessment of  the general condition with respect to safety of the project based upon  available data and a visual inspection, determine any need for emergency  measures and conclude if additional studies, investigation and analyses  are necessary and warranted. A review will be made of pertinent existing  and available engineering data relative to the design, construction and  operation of the dam and appurtenant structures, including electrical  and mechanical operating equipment and measurements from inspection and  performance instruments and devices; and a detailed systematic visual  inspection will be performed of those features relating to the stability  and operational adequacy of the project. Based upon findings of the  review of engineering data and the visual inspection, an evaluation will  be made of the general condition of the dam, including where possible  the assessment of the hydraulic and hydrologic capabilities and the  structural stability.</p><p class="depth0">3.3. Engineering data. To the extent feasible the engineering data  listed in Appendix I relating to the design, construction and operation  of the dam and appurtenant structures, should be collected from existing  records and reviewed to aid in evaluating the adequacy of hydraulic and  hydrologic capabilities and stability of the dam. Where the necessary  engineering data are unavailable, inadequate or invalid, a listing  should be made of those specific additional data deemed necessary by the  engineer in charge of the investigation and included in the Phase I  report.</p><p class="depth0">3.4. Field inspections. The field inspection of the dam, appurtenant  stuctures, reservoir area, and downstream channel in the vicinity of the  dam should be conducted in a systematic manner to minimize the  possibility of any significant feature being overlooked. A detailed  checklist should be developed and followed for each dam inspected to  document   the examination of each significant structural and hydraulic feature  including electrical and mechanical equipment for operation of the  control facilities that affect the safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.1. Particular attention should be given to detecting evidence of  leakage, erosion, seepage, slope instability, undue settlement,  displacement, tilting, cracking, deterioration, and improper functioning  of drains and relief wells. The adequacy and quality of maintenance and  operating procedures as they pertain to the safety of the dam and  operation of the control facilities should also be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.2. Photographs and drawings should be used freely to record  conditions in order to minimize descriptions.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.3. The field inspection should include appropriate features and  items, including but not limited to those listed in Appendix II, which  may influence the safety of the dam or indicate potential hazards to  human life or property.</p><p class="depth0">3.5. Evaluation of hydraulic and hydrologic Features.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.1. Design data. Original hydraulic and hydrologic design  assumptions obtained from the project records should be assessed to  determine their acceptability in evaluating the safety of the dam. All  constraints on water control such as blocked entrances, restrictions on  operation of spillway and outlet gates, inadequate energy dissipators or  restrictive channel conditions, significant reduction in reservoir  capacity by sediment deposits and other factors should be considered in  evaluating the validity of discharge ratings, storage capacity,  hydrographs, routings and regulation plans. The discharge capacity and/ or storage capacity should be capable of safely handling the recommended  spillway design flood for the size and hazard potential classification  of the dam as indicated in Table 3. The hydraulic and hydrologic  determinations for design as obtained from project records will be  acceptable if conventional techniques similar to the procedures outlined  in paragraph 4.3. were used in obtaining the data. When the project  design flood actually used exceeds the recommended spillway design  flood, from Table 3, the project design flood will be acceptable in  evaluating the safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3--Hydrologic Evaluation Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">[Recommended spillway design floods] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Spillway design</p><p class="depth0">Hazard                      Size           flood (SDF) \1\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Low.............................

Where</p><p class="depth0">a range of SDF is indicated, the magnitude that most closely relates</p><p class="depth0">to the involved risk should be selected.  1000-yr=100-Year Exceedence Interval. The flood magnitude expected to be</p><p class="depth0">exceeded, on the average, of once in 100 years. It may also be</p><p class="depth0">expressed as an exceedence frequency with a one-percent chance</p><p class="depth0">of being exceeded in any given year. PMF=Probable Maximum Flood. The flood that may be expected from the most</p><p class="depth0">severe combination of critical meteorologic and hydrologic</p><p class="depth0">conditions that are reasonably possible in the region. The PMF</p><p class="depth0">is derived from probable maximum precipitation (PMP), which</p><p class="depth0">information is generally available from the National Weather</p><p class="depth0">Service, NOAA. Most Federal agencies apply reduction factors</p><p class="depth0">to the PMP when appropriate. Reductions may be applied because</p><p class="depth0">rainfall isohyetals are unlikely to conform to the exact shape</p><p class="depth0">of the drainage basin and/or the storm is not likely to center</p><p class="depth0">exactly over the drainage basin. In some cases local</p><p class="depth0">topography will cause changes from the generalized PMP values,</p><p class="depth0">therefore it may be advisable to contact Federal construction</p><p class="depth0">agencies to obtain the prevailing practice in specific areas.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2. Experience data. In some cases where design data are lacking,  an evaluation of overtopping potential may be based on watershed  characteristics and rainfall and reservoir records. An estimate of the  probable maximum flood may also be developed from a conservative,  generalized comparison of the drainage area size and the magnitude of  recently adopted probable maximum floods for damsites in comparable  hydrologic regions. Where the review of such experience data indicates  that the recommended spillway design flood would not cause overtopping  additional hydraulic and hydrologic determinations will be unnecessary.</p><p class="depth0">3.6. Evaluation of structural stability. The Phase I evaluations of  structural adequacy of project features are expected to be based  principally on existing conditions as revealed by the visual inspection,  together with available design and construction information and records  of performance. The objectives are to determine the existence of  conditions which are hazardous, or which   with time might develop into safety hazards, and to formulate  recommendations pertaining to the need for any additional studies,  investigations, or analyses. The results of this phase of the inspection  must rely very substantially upon the experience and judgment of the  inspecting engineer.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.1. Design and construction data. The principal design  assumptions and analyses obtained from the project records should be  assessed. Original design and construction records should be used  judiciously, recognizing the restricted applicability of such data as  material strengths and permeabilities, geological factors and  construction descriptions. Original stability studies and analyses  should be acceptable if conventional techniques and procedures similar  to those outlined in paragraph 4.4 were employed, provided that review  of operational and performance data confirm that the original design  assumptions were adequately conservative. The need for such analyses  where either none exist or the originals are incomplete or  unsatisfactory will be determined by the inspecting engineer based upon  other factors such as condition of structures, prior maximum loadings  and the hazard degree of the project. Design assumptions and analyses  should include all applicable loads including earthquake and indicate  the structure's capability to resist overturning, sliding and  overstressing with adequate factors of safety. In general seepage and  stability analyses comparable to the requirements of paragraph 4.4  should be on record for all dams in the high hazard category and large  dams in the significant hazard category. This requirement for other dams  will be subject to the opinion of the inspecting engineer.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.2. Operating records. The performance of structures under prior  maximum loading conditions should in some instances provide partial  basis for stability evaluation. Satisfactory experience under loading  conditions not expected to be exceeded in the future should generally be  indicative of satisfactory stability, provided adverse changes in  physical conditions have not occurred. Instrumentation observations of  forces, pressures, loads, stresses, strains, displacements, deflections  or other related conditions should also be utilized in the safety  evaluation. Where such data indicate abnormal behavior, unsafe movement  or deflections, or loadings which adversely affect the stability or  functioning of the structure, prompt reporting of such circumstances is  required without the delay for preparation of the official inspection  report.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3. Post construction changes. Data should be collected on  changes which have occurred since project construction that might  influence the safety of the dam such as road cuts, quarries, mining and  groundwater changes.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.4. Seismic stability. An assessment should be made of the  potential vulnerability of the dam to seismic events and a  recommendation developed with regard to the need for additional seismic  investigation. In general, projects located in Seismic Zones 0, 1 and 2  may be assumed to present no hazard from earthquake provided static  stability conditions are satisfactory and conventional safety margins  exist. Dams in Zones 3 and 4 should, as a minimum, have on record  suitable analyses made by conventional equivalent static load methods.  The seismic zones together with appropriate coefficients for use in such  analyses are shown in Figures 1 through 4. Boundary lines are  approximate and in the event of doubt about the proper zone, the higher  zone should be used. All high hazard category dams in Zone 4 and high  hazard dams of the hydraulic fill type in Zone 3 should have a stability  assessment based upon knowledge of regional and local geology,  engineering seismology, in situ properties of materials and appropriate  dynamic analytical and testing procedures. The assessment should include  the possibility of physical displacement of the structures due to  movements along active faults. Departure from this general guidance  should be made whenever in the judgment of the investigating engineer  different seismic stability requirements are warranted because of local  geological conditions or other reasons.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 4--Phase II Investigation</p><p class="depth0">4.1. Purpose. The Phase II investigation will be supplementary to  Phase I and should be conducted when the results of the Phase I  investigation indicate the need for additional in-depth studies,  investigations or analyses.</p><p class="depth0">4.2. Scope. The Phase II investigation should include all additional  studies, investigations and analyses necessary to evaluate the safety of  the dam. Included, as required, will be additional visual inspections,  measurements, foundation exploration and testing, materials testing,  hydraulic and hydrologic analysis and structural stability analyses.</p><p class="depth0">4.3. Hydraulic and hydrologic analysis. Hydraulic and hydrologic  capabilities should be determined using the following criteria and  procedures. Depending on the project characteristics, either the  spillway design flood peak inflow or the spillway design flood  hydrograph should be the basis for determining the maximum water surface  elevation and maximum outflow. If the operation or failure of upstream  water control projects would have significant impact on peak flow or  hydrograph analyses, the impact should be assessed.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1. Maximum water surface based on SDF peak inflow. When the  total project discharge capability at maximum pool exceeds the peak  inflow of the recommended SDF, and   operational constraints would not prevent such a release at controlled  projects, a reservoir routing is not required. The maximum discharge  should be assumed equal to the peak inflow of the spillway design flood.  Flood volume is not controlling in this situation and surcharge storage  is either absent or is significant only to the extent that it provides  the head necessary to develop the release capability required.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.1. Peak for 100-year flood. When the 100-year flood is  applicable under the provisions of Table 3 and data are available, the  spillway design flood peak inflow may be determined by use of ``A  Uniform Technique for Determining Flood Frequencies,'' Water Resources  Council (WRC), Hydrology Committee, Bulletin 15, December 1967. Flow  frequency information from regional analysis is generally preferred over  single station results when available and appropriate. Rainfall-runoff  techniques may be necessary when there are inadequate runoff data  available to make a reasonable estimate of flow frequency.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1.2. Peak for PMF or fraction thereof. When either the Probable  Maximum Flood peak or a fraction thereof is applicable under the  provisions of Table 3, the unit hydrograph--infiltration loss technique  is generally the most expeditious method of computing the spillway  design flood peak for most projects. This technique is discussed in the  following paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2. Maximum water surface based on SDF hydrograph. Both peak and  volume are required in this analysis. Where surcharge storage is  significant, or where there is insufficient discharge capability at  maximum pool to pass the peak inflow of the SDF, considering all  possible operational constraints, a flood hydrograph is required. When  there are upstream hazard areas that would be imperiled by fast rising  reservoirs levels, SDF hydrographs should be routed to ascertain  available time for warning and escape. Determination of probable maximum  precipitation or 100-year precipitation, which ever is applicable, and  unit hydrographs or runoff models will be required, followed by the  determination of the PMF or 100-year flood. Conservative loss rates  (significantly reduced by antecedent rainfall conditions where  appropriate) should be estimated for computing the rainfall excess to be  utilized with unit hydrographs. Rainfall values are usually arranged  with gradually ascending and descending rates with the maximum rate late  in the storm. When applicable, conservatively high snowmelt runoff rates  and appropriate releases from upstream projects should be assumed. The  PMP may be obtained from National Weather Service (NWS) publications  such as Hydrometeorological Report (HMR) 33. Special NWS publications  for particular areas should be used when available. Rainfall for the  100-year frequency flood can be obtained from the NWS publication  ``Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States,'' Technical Paper No.  40; Atlas 2, ``Precipitation Frequency Atlas of Western United States;''  or other NWS publications. The maximum water surface elevation and  spillway design flood outflow are then determined by routing the inflow  hydrograph through the reservoir surcharge storage, assuming a starting  water surface at the bottom of surcharge storage, or lower when  appropriate. For projects where the bottom of surcharge space is not  distinct, or the flood control storage space (exclusive of surcharge) is  appreciable, it may be appropriate to select starting water surface  elevations below the top of the flood control storage for routings.  Conservatively high starting levels should be estimated on the basis of  hydrometeorological conditions reasonably characteristic for the region  and flood release capability of the project. Necessary adjustment of  reservoir storage capacity due to existing or future sediment or other  encroachment may be approximated when accurate determination of  deposition is not practicable.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.3. Acceptable procedures. Techniques for performing hydraulic  and hydrologic analyses are generally available from publications  prepared by Federal agencies involved in water resources development or  textbooks written by the academic community. Some of these procedures  are rather sophisticated and require expensive computational equipment  and large data banks. While results of such procedures are generally  more reliable than simplified methods, their use is generally not  warranted in studies connected with this program unless they can be  performed quickly and inexpensively. There may be situations where the  more complex techniques have to be employed to obtain reliable results;  however, these cases will be exceptions rather than the rule. Whenever  the acceptability of procedures is in question, the advice of competent  experts should be sought. Such expertise is generally available in the  Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation and Soil Conservation Service.  Many other agencies, educational facilities and private consultants can  also provide expert advice. Regardless of where such expertise is based,  the qualification of those individuals offering to provide it should be  carefully examined and evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.4. Freeboard allowances. Guidelines on specific minimum  freeboard allowances are not considered appropriate because of the many  factors involved in such determinations. The investigator will have to  assess the critical parameters for each project and develop its minimum  requirement. Many projects are reasonably safe without freeboard  allowance because they are designed for overtopping, or other factors  minimize possible overtopping. Conversely,   freeboard allowances of several feet may be necessary to provide a safe  condition. Parameters that should be considered include the duration of  high water levels in the reservoir during the design flood; the  effective wind fetch and reservoir depth available to support wave  generation; the probability of high wind speed occurring from a critical  direction; the potential wave runup on the dam based on roughness and  slope; and the ability of the dam to resist erosion from overtopping  waves.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Stability investigations. The Phase II stability investigations  should be compatible with the guidelines of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.1 Foundation and material investigations. The scope of the  foundation and materials investigation should be limited to obtaining  the information required to analyze the structural stability and to  investigate any suspected condition which would adversely affect the  safety of the dam. Such investigations may include borings to obtain  concrete, embankment, soil foundation, and bedrock samples; testing  specimens from these samples to determine the strength and elastic  parameters of the materials, including the soft seams, joints, fault  gouge and expansive clays or other critical materials in the foundation;  determining the character of the bedrock including joints, bedding  planes, fractures, faults, voids and caverns, and other geological  irregularities; and installing instruments for determining movements,  strains, suspected excessive internal seepage pressures, seepage  gradients and uplift forces. Special investigations may be necessary  where suspect rock types such as limestone, gypsum, salt, basalt,  claystone, shales or others are involved in foundations or abutments in  order to determine the extent of cavities, piping or other deficiencies  in the rock foundation. A concrete core drilling program should be  undertaken only when the existence of significant structural cracks is  suspected or the general qualitative condition of the concrete is in  doubt. The tests of materials will be necessary only where such data are  lacking or are outdated.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.2. Stability assessment. Stability assessments should utilize in  situ properties of the structure and its foundation and pertinent  geologic information. Geologic information that should be considered  includes groundwater and seepage conditions; lithology, stratigraphy,  and geologic details disclosed by borings, ``as-built'' records, and  geologic interpretation; maximum past overburden at site as deduced from  geologic evidence; bedding, folding and faulting; joints and joint  systems; weathering; slickensides, and field evidence relating to  slides, faults, movements and earthquake activity. Foundations may  present problems where they contain adversely oriented joints,  slickensides or fissured material, faults, seams of soft materials, or  weak layers. Such defects and excess pore water pressures may contribute  to instability. Special tests may be necessary to determine physical  properties of particular materials. The results of stability analyses  afford a means of evaluating the structure's existing resistance to  failure and also the effects of any proposed modifications. Results of  stability analyses should be reviewed for compatibility with performance  experience when possible.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.2.1. Seismic stability. The inertial forces for use in the  conventional equivalent static force method of analysis should be  obtained by multiplying the weight by the seismic coefficient and should  be applied as a horizontal force at the center of gravity of the section  or element. The seismic coefficients suggested for use with such  analyses are listed in Figures 1 through 4. Seismic stability  investigations for all high hazard category dams located in Seismic Zone  4 and high hazard dams of the hydraulic fill type in Zone 3 should  include suitable dynamic procedures and analyses. Dynamic analyses for  other dams and higher seismic coefficients are appropriate if in the  judgment of the investigating engineer they are warranted because of  proximity to active faults or other reasons. Seismic stability  investigations should utilize ``state-of-the-art'' procedures involving  seismological and geological studies to establish earthquake parameters  for use in dynamic stability analyses and, where appropriate, the  dynamic testing of materials. Stability analyses may be based upon  either time-history or response spectra techniques. The results of  dynamic analyses should be assessed on the basis of whether or not the  dam would have sufficient residual integrity to retain the reservoir  during and after the greatest or most adverse earthquake which might  occur near the project location.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.2.2. Clay shale foundation. Clay shale is a highly  overconsolidated sedimentary rock comprised predominantly of clay  minerals, with little or no cementation. Foundations of clay shales  require special measures in stability investigations. Clay shales,  particularly those containing montmorillonite, may be highly susceptible  to expansion and consequent loss of strength upon unloading. The shear  strength and the resistance to deformation of clay shales may be quite  low and high pore water pressures may develop under increase in load.  The presence of slickensides in clay shales is usually an indication of  low shear strength. Prediction of field behavior of clay shales should  not be based solely on results of conventional laboratory tests since  they may be misleading. The use of peak shear strengths for clay shales  in stability analyses may be unconservative because of nonuniform stress  distribution and possible progressive failures. Thus the available shear  resistance may be less than if the peak shear strength   were mobilized simultaneously along the entire failure surface. In such  cases, either greater safety factors or residual shear strength should  be used.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3. Embankment dams.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3.1. Liquefaction. The phenomenon of liquefaction of loose,  saturated sands and silts may occur when such materials are subjected to  shear deformation or earthquake shocks. The possibility of liquefaction  must presently be evaluated on the basis of empirical knowledge  supplemented by special laboratory tests and engineering judgment. The  possiblitity of liquefaction in sands diminishes as the relative density  increases above approximately 70 percent. Hydraulic fill dams in Seismic  Zones 3 and 4 should receive particular attention since such dams are  susceptible to liquefaction under earthquake shocks.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3.2. Shear failure. Shear failure is one in which a portion of  an embankment or of an embankment and foundation moves by sliding or  rotating relative to the remainder of the mass. It is conventionally  represented as occurring along a surface and is so assumed in stability  analyses, although shearing may occur in a zone of substantial  thickness. The circular arc or the sliding wedge method of analyzing  stability, as pertinent, should be used. The circular arc method is  generally applicable to essentially homogeneous embankments and to soil  foundations consisting of thick deposits of fine-grained soil containing  no layers significantly weaker than other strata in the foundation. The  wedge method is generally applicable to rockfill dams and to earth dams  on foundations containing weak layers. Other methods of analysis such as  those employing complex shear surfaces may be appropriate depending on  the soil and rock in the dam and foundation. Such methods should be in  reputable usage in the engineering profession.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3.3. Loading conditions. The loading conditions for which the  embankment structures should be investigated are (I) Sudden drawdown  from spillway crest elevation or top of gates, (II) Partial pool, (III)  Steady state seepage from spillway crest elevation or top of gate  elevation, and (IV) Earthquake. Cases I and II apply to upstream slopes  only; slopes; and Case IV applies to both upstream and downstream Case  III applies to downstream slopes. A summary of suggested strengths and  safety factors are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--Factors of Safety \1\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Factor</p><p class="depth0">Case and loading condition            of         Shear \2\ strength                   Remarks</p><p class="depth0">safety ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I Sudden drawdown from spillway crest or  \3\ 1.2  Minimum composite of R and   Within the drawdown zone</p><p class="depth0">top of gates to minimum drawdown                   S shear strengths.

Shear strength tests are classified according to the controlled drainage conditions</p><p class="depth0">maintained during the test. R tests are those in which specimen drainage is allowed during consolidation (or</p><p class="depth0">swelling) under initial stress conditions, but specimen drainage is not allowed during application of shearing</p><p class="depth0">stresses. S tests allow full drainage during initial stress application and shearing is at a slow rate so that</p><p class="depth0">complete specimen drainage is permitted during the complete test.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3.4. Safety factors. Safety factors for embankment dam stability  studies should be based on the ratio of available shear strength to  developed shear strength, SD: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.000  Where:  C=Cohesion [phis]=Angle of internal friction [sigma]=Normal stress</p><p class="depth0">The factors of safety listed in Table 4 are recommended as minimum  acceptable. Final accepted factors of safety should depend upon the  degree of confidence the investigating engineer has in the engineering  data   available to him. The consequences of a failure with respect to human  life and property damage are important considerations in establishing  factors of safety for specific investigations.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3.5. Seepage failure. A critical uncontrolled underseepage or  through seepage condition that develops during a rising pool can quickly  reduce a structure which was stable under previous conditions, to a  total structural failure. The visually confirmed seepage conditions to  be avoided are (1) the exit of the phreatic surface on the downstream  slope of the dam and (2) development of hydrostatic heads sufficient to  create in the area downstream of the dam sand boils that erode materials  by the phenomenon known as ``piping'' and (3) localized concentrations  of seepage along conduits or through pervious zones. The dams most  susceptible to seepage problems are those built of or on pervious  materials of uniform fine particle size, with no provisions for an  internal drainage zone and/or no underseepage controls.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.3.6. Seepage analyses. Review and modifications to original  seepage design analyses should consider conditions observed in the field  inspection and piezometer instrumentation. A seepage analysis should  consider the permeability ratios resulting from natural deposition and  from compaction placement of materials with appropriate variation  between horizontal and vertical permeability. An underseepage analysis  of the embankment should provide a critical gradient factor of safety  for the maximum head condition of not less than 1.5 in the area  downstream of the embankment.

The factor of safety of 1.5  is a recommended minimum and may be adjusted by the responsible engineer  based on the competence of the engineering data.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4. Concrete dams and appurtenant structures.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.1. Requirements for stability. Concrete dams and structures  appurtenant to embankment dams should be capable of resisting  overturning, sliding and overstressing with adequate factors of safety  for normal and maximum loading conditions.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.2. Loads. Loadings to be considered in stability analyses  include the water load on the upstream face of the dam; the weight of  the structure; internal hydrostatic pressures (uplift) within the body  of the dam, at the base of the dam and within the foundation; earth and  silt loads; ice pressure, seismic and thermal loads, and other loads as  applicable. Where tailwater or backwater exists on the downstream side  of the structure it should be considered, and assumed uplift pressures  should be compatible with drainage provisions and uplift measurements if  available. Where applicable, ice pressure should be applied to the  contact surface of the structure of normal pool elevation. A unit  pressure of not more than 5,000 pounds per square foot should be used.  Normally, ice thickness should not be assumed greater than two feet.  Earthquake forces should consist of the inertial forces due to the  horizontal acceleration of the dam itself and hydrodynamic forces  resulting from the reaction of the reservoir water against the  structure. Dynamic water pressures for use in a conventional methods of  analysis may be computed by means of the ``Westergaard Formula'' using  the parabolic approximation (H.M. Westergaard, ``Water Pressures on Dams  During Earthquakes,'' Trans., ASCE, Vol 98, 1933, pages 418-433), or  similar method.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.3. Stresses. The analysis of concrete stresses should be based  on in situ properties of the concrete and foundation. Computed maximum  compressive stresses for normal operating conditions in the order of \1/ 3\ or less of in situ strengths should be satisfactory. Tensile stresses  in unreinforced concrete should be acceptable only in locations where  cracks will not adversely affect the overall performance and stability  of the structure. Foundation stresses should be such as to provide  adequate safety against failure of the foundation material under all  loading conditions.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.4. Overturning. A gravity structure should be capable of  resisting all overturning forces. It can be considered safe against  overturning if the resultant of all combinations of horizontal and  vertical forces, excluding earthquake forces, acting above any  horizontal plane through the structure or at its base is located within  the middle third of the section. When earthquake is included the  resultant should fall within the limits of the plane or base, and  foundation pressures must be acceptable. When these requirements for  location of the resultant are not satisfied the investigating engineer  should assess the importance to stability of the deviations.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.5. Sliding. Sliding of concrete gravity structures and of  abutment and foundation rock masses for all types of concrete dams   should be evaluated by the shear-friction resistance concept. The  available sliding resistance is compared with the driving force which  tends to induce sliding to arrive at a sliding stability safety factor.  The investigation should be made along all potential sliding paths. The  critical path is that plane or combination of planes which offers the  least resistance.</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.5.1. Sliding resistance. Sliding resistance is a function of  the unit shearing strength at no normal load (cohesion) and the angle of  friction on a potential failure surface. It is determined by computing  the maximum horizontal driving force which could be resisted along the  sliding path under investigation. The following general formula is  obtained from the principles of statics and may be derived by resolving  forces parallel and perpendicular to the sliding plane:  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.002  Where:  RR=Sliding Resistance (maximum horizontal driving force which</p><p class="depth0">can be resisted by the critical path) [phis]=Angle of internal friction of foundation material or, where</p><p class="depth0">applicable, angle of sliding friction V=Summation of vertical forces (including uplift) c=Unit shearing strength at zero normal loading along potential failure</p><p class="depth0">plane A=Area of potential failure plane developing unit shear strength ``c'' [alpha]=Angle between inclined plane and horizontal (positive for uphill</p><p class="depth0">sliding)</p><p class="depth0">For sliding downhill the angle [alpha] is negative and Equation (1)  becomes: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.003</p><p class="depth0">When the plane of investigation is horizontal, and the angle [alpha]  is zero and Equation (1) reduced to the following: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.004</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.5.2. Downstream esistance. When the base of a concrete  structure is embedded in rock or the potential failure plane lies below  the base, the passive resistance of the downstream layer of rock may  sometimes be utilized for sliding resistance. Rock that may be subjected  to high velocity water scouring should not be used. The magnitude of the  downstream resistance is the lesser of (a) the shearing resistance along  the continuation of the potential sliding plane until it daylights or  (b) the resistance available from the downstream rock wedge along an  inclined plane. The theoretical resistance offered by the passive wedge  can be computed by a formula equivalent to formula (3): [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.005  Where:  Pp=Passive resistance of rock wedge W=Weight (buoyant weight if applicable) of downstream rock wedge above</p><p class="depth0">inclined plane of resistance, plus any superimposed loads [phis]=Angle of internal friction or, if applicable, angle of sliding</p><p class="depth0">friction [alpha]=Angle between inclined failure plane and horizontal c=Unit shearing strength at zero normal load along failure plane A=Area of inclined plane of resistance</p><p class="depth0">When considering cross-bed shear through a relatively shallow,  competent rock strut, without adverse jointing or faulting, W and  [alpha] may be taken at zero and 45, respectively, and an estimate of  passive wedge resistance   per unit width obtained by the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.006  Where:  D=Thickness of the rock strut</p><p class="depth0">4.4.4.5.3. Safety factor. The shear-friction safety factor is  obtained by dividing the resistance RR by H, the summation of  horizontal service loads to be applied to the structure: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.007</p><p class="depth0">When the downstream passive wedge contributes to the sliding  resistance, the shear friction safety factor formula becomes: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.008</p><p class="depth0">The above direct superimposition of passive wedge resistance is  valid only if shearing rigidities of the foundation components are  similar. Also, the compressive strength and buckling resistance of the  downstream rock layer must be sufficient to develop the wedge  resistance. For example, a foundation with closely spaced, near  horizontal, relatively weak seams might not contain sufficient buckling  strength to develop the magnitude of wedge resistance computed from the  cross-bed shear strength. In this case wedge resistance should not be  assumed without resorting to special treatment (such as installing  foundation anchors). Computed sliding safety factors approximating 3 or  more for all loading conditions without earthquake, and 1.5 including  earthquake, should indicate satisfactory stability, depending upon the  reliability of the strength parameters used in the analyses. In some  cases when the results of comprehensive foundation studies are  available, smaller safety factors may be acceptable. The selection of  shear strength parameters should be fully substantiated. The bases for  any assumptions; the results of applicable testing, studies and  investigations; and all pre-existing, pertinent data should be reported  and evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">Chapter 5--Reports</p><p class="depth0">5.1.

Concrete Structures in General.</p><p class="depth0">a. Concrete Surfaces. The condition of the concrete surfaces should  be examined to evaluate the deterioration and continuing serviceability  of the concrete. Descriptions of concrete conditions should conform with  the appendix to ``Guide for Making a Condition Survey of Concrete in  Service,'' American Concrete Institute (ACI) Journal, Proceedings Vol.  65, No. 11, November 1968, page 905-918.</p><p class="depth0">b. Structural Cracking. Concrete structures should be examined for  structural cracking resulting from overstress due to applied loads,  shrinkage and temperature effects or differential movements.</p><p class="depth0">c. Movement--Horizontal and Vertical Alignment. Concrete structures  should be examined for evidence of any abnormal settlements, heaving,  deflections, or lateral movements.</p><p class="depth0">d. Junctions. The conditions at the junctions of the structure with  abutments or embankments should be determined.</p><p class="depth0">e. Drains--Foundation, Joint, Face. All drains should be examined to  determine that they are capable of performing their design function.</p><p class="depth0">f. Water Passages. All water passages and other concrete surfaces  subject to running water should be examined for erosion, cavitation,  obstructions, leakage or significant structural cracks.</p><p class="depth0">g. Seepage or Leakage. The faces, abutments and toes of the concrete  structures should be examined for evidence of seepage or abnormal  leakage, and records of flow of downstream springs reviewed for  variation with reservoir pool level. The sources of seepage should be  determined if possible.</p><p class="depth0">h. Monolith Joints--Construction Joints. All monolith and  construction joints should be examined to determine the condition of the  joint and filler material, any movement of joints, or any indication of  distress or leakage.</p><p class="depth0">i. Foundation. Foundation should be examined for damage or possible  undermining of the downstream toe.</p><p class="depth0">j. Abutments. The abutments should be examined for sign of  instability or excessive weathering.</p><p class="depth0">2. Embankment Structures.</p><p class="depth0">a. Settlement. The embankments and downstream toe areas should be  examined for any evidence of localized or overall settlement,  depressions or sink holes.</p><p class="depth0">b. Slope Stability. Embankment slopes should be examined for  irregularities in   alignment and variances from smooth uniform slopes, unusual changes from  original crest alignment and elevation, evidence of movement at or  beyond the toe, and surface cracks which indicate movement.</p><p class="depth0">c. Seepage. The downstream face of abutments, embankment slopes and  toes, embankment--structure contacts, and the downstream valley areas  should be examined for evidence of existing or past seepage. The sources  of seepage should be investigated to determine cause and potential  severity to dam safety under all operating conditions. The presence of  animal burrows and tree growth on slopes which might cause detrimental  seepage should be examined.</p><p class="depth0">d. Drainage Systems. All drainage systems should be examined to  determine whether the systems can freely pass discharge and that the  discharge water is not carrying embankment or foundation material.  Systems used to monitor drainage should be examined to assure they are  operational and functioning properly.</p><p class="depth0">e. Slope Protection. The slope protection should be examined for  erosion-formed gullies and wave-formed notches and benches that have  reduced the embankment cross-section or exposed less wave resistant  materials. The adequacy of slope protection against waves, currents, and  surface runoff that may occur at the site should be evaluated. The  condition of vegetative cover should be evaluated where pertinent.</p><p class="depth0">3. Spillway Structures. Examination should be made of the structures  and features including bulkheads, flashboards, and fuse plugs of all  service and auxiliary spillways which serve as principal or emergency  spillways for any condition which may impose operational constraints on  the functioning of the spillway.</p><p class="depth0">a. Control Gates and Operating Machinery. The structural members,  connections, hoists, cables and operating machinery and the adequacy of  normal and emergency power supplies should be examined and tested to  determine the structural integrity and verify the operational adequacy  of the equipment. Where cranes are intended to be used for handling  gates and bulkheads, the availability, capacity and condition of the  cranes and lifting beams should be investigated. Operation of control  systems and protective and alarm devices such as limit switches, sump  high water alarms and drainage pumps should be investigated.</p><p class="depth0">b. Unlined Saddle Spillways. Unlined saddle spillways should be  examined for evidence of erosion and any conditions which may impose  constraints on the functioning of the spillway. The ability of the  spillway to resist erosion due to operation and the potential hazard to  the safety of the dam from such operation should be determined.</p><p class="depth0">c. Approach and Outlet Channels. The approach and outlet channels  should be examined for any conditions which may impose constraints on  the functioning of the spillway and present a potential hazard to the  safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">d. Stilling Basin (Energy Dissipators). Stilling basins including  baffles, flip buckets or other energy dissipators should be examined for  any conditions which may pose constraints on the ability of the stilling  basin to prevent downstream scour or erosion which may create or present  a potential hazard to the safety of the dam. The existing condition of  the channel downstream of the stilling basin should be determined.</p><p class="depth0">4. Outlet Works. The outlet works examination should include all  structures and features designed to release reservoir water below the  spillway crest through or around the dam.</p><p class="depth0">a. Intake Structure. The structure and all features should be  examined for any conditions which may impose operational constraints on  the outlet works. Entrances to intake structure should be examined for  conditions such as silt or debris accumulation which may reduce the  discharge capabilities of the outlet works.</p><p class="depth0">b. Operating and Emergency Control Gates. The structural members,  connections, guides, hoists, cables and operating machinery including  the adequacy of normal and emergency power supplies should be examined  and tested to determine the structural integrity and verify the  operational adequacy of the operating and emergency gates, valves,  bulkheads, and other equipment.</p><p class="depth0">c. Conduits, Sluices, Water Passages, Etc. The interior surfaces of  conduits should be examined for erosion, corrosion, cavitation, cracks,  joint separation and leakage at cracks or joints.</p><p class="depth0">d. Stilling Basin (Energy Dissipator). The stilling basin or other  energy dissipator should be examined for conditions which may impose any  constraints on the ability of the stilling basin to prevent downstream  scour or erosion which may create or present a potential hazard to the  safety of the dam. The existing condition of the channel downstream of  the stilling basin should be determined by soundings.</p><p class="depth0">e. Approach and Outlet Channels. The approach and outlet channels  should be examined for any conditions which may impose constraints on  the functioning of the discharge facilities of the outlet works, or  present a hazard to the safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">f. Drawdown Facilities. Facilities provided for drawdown of the  reservoir to avert impending failure of the dam or to facilitate repairs  in the event of stability or foundation problems should be examined for  any conditions which may impose constraints on their functioning as  planned.</p><p class="depth0">5. Safety and Performance Instrumentation. Instruments which have  been installed to measure behavior of the structures should be   examined for proper functioning. The available records and readings of  installed instruments should be reviewed to detect any unusual  performance of the instruments or evidence of unusual performance or  distress of the structure. The adequacy of the installed instrumentation  to measure the performance and safety of the dam should be determined.</p><p class="depth0">a. Headwater and Tailwater Gages. The existing records of the  headwater and tailwater gages should be examined to determine the  relationship between other instrumentation measurements such as stream  flow, uplift pressures, alignment, and drainage system discharge with  the upper and lower water surface elevations.</p><p class="depth0">b. Horizontal and Vertical Alignment Instrumentation (Concrete  Structures). The existing records of alignment and elevation surveys and  measurements from inclinometers, inverted plumb bobs, gage points across  cracks and joints, or other devices should be examined to determine any  change from the original position of the structures.</p><p class="depth0">c. Horizontal and Vertical Movement, Consolidation, and Pore-Water  Pressure Instrumentation (Embankment Structures). The existing records  of measurements from settlement plates or gages, surface reference  marks, slope indicators and other devices should be examined to  determine the movement history of the embankment. Existing piezometer  measurements should be examined to determine if the pore-water pressures  in the embankment and foundation would under given conditions impair the  safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">d. Uplift Instrumentation. The existing records of uplift  measurements should be examined to determine if the uplift pressures for  the maximum pool would impair the safety of the dam.</p><p class="depth0">e. Drainage System Instrumentation. The existing records of  measurements of the drainage system flow should be examined to establish  the normal relationship between pool elevations and discharge quantities  and any changes that have occurred in this relationship during the  history of the project.</p><p class="depth0">f. Seismic Instrumentation. The existing records of seismic  instrumentation should be examined to determine the seismic activity in  the area and the response of the structures of past earthquakes.</p><p class="depth0">6. Reservoir. The following features of the reservoir should be  examined to determine to what extent the water impounded by the dam  would constitute a danger to the safety of the dam or a hazard to human  life or property.</p><p class="depth0">a. Shore line. The land forms around the reservoir should be  examined for indications of major active or inactive landslide areas and  to determine susceptibility of bedrock stratigraphy to massive  landslides of sufficient magnitude to significantly reduce reservoir  capacity or create waves that might overtop the dam.</p><p class="depth0">b. Sedimentation. The reservoir and drainage area should be examined  for excessive sedimentation or recent developments in the drainage basin  which could cause a sudden increase in sediment load thereby reducing  the reservoir capacity with attendant increase in maximum outflow and  maximum pool elevation.</p><p class="depth0">c. Potential Upstream Hazard Areas. The reservoir area should be  examined for features subject to potential backwater flooding resulting  in loss of human life or property at reservoir levels up to the maximum  water storage capacity including any surcharge storage.</p><p class="depth0">d. Watershed Runoff Potential. The drainage basin should be examined  for any extensive alterations to the surface of the drainage basin such  as changed agriculture practices, timber clearing, railroad or highway  construction or real estate developments that might extensively affect  the runoff characteristics. Upstream projects that could have impact on  the safety of the dam should be identified.</p><p class="depth0">7. Downstream Channel. The channel immediately downstream of the dam  should be examined for conditions which might impose any constraints on  the operation of the dam or present any hazards to the safety of the  dam. Development of the potential flooded area downstream of the dam  should be assessed for compatibility with the hazard classification.</p><p class="depth0">8. Operation and Maintenance Features.</p><p class="depth0">a. Reservoir Regulation Plan. The actual practices in regulating the  reservoir and discharges under normal and emergency conditions should be  examined to determine if they comply with the designed reservoir  regulation plan and to assure that they do not constitute a danger to  the safety of the dam or to human life or property.</p><p class="depth0">b. Maintenance. The maintenance of the operating facilities and  features that pertain to the safety of the dam should be examined to  determine the adequacy and quality of the maintenance procedures  followed in maintaining the dam and facilities in safe operating  condition.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix III to App. D to Sec. 222.6--Pub.

All information pertaining to each dam to be inspected as  contained in the National Inventory of Dams.</p><p class="depth0">b. Copies of recommended format for preparation of inspection  report, engineering data check list and visual inspection check list.</p><p class="depth0">c. All available pertinent information pertaining to the Dam  Inspection Program and previous investigations having a bearing on  inspections to be performed under this contract.</p><p class="depth0">d. Right-of-entry for access to each dam site.</p><p class="depth0">3. Services To Be Rendered by the Architect-Engineer. The principal  services, subject to the optional provisions of the contract, to be  rendered by the AE are itemized below:</p><p class="depth0">a. Technical Investigations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Engineering Data Collection. To the extent feasible, the  engineering data listed in Appendix I of the OCE guidelines relating to  the design, construction and operation of the dam and appurtenant  structures, should be collected from existing records and reviewed to  aid in evaluating the general condition of each dam, including an  assessment of the hydraulic and hydrologic features and structural  stability of the dam. Where the necessary engineering data are  unavailable, inadequate or invalid, a listing shall be made of those  specific additional data deemed necessary by the engineer in charge of  the investigation and included in the inspection report. The engineering  data checklist provided by the Contracting Officer shall be used as a  guide to compile this data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Field Inspections. The field inspection of each dam shall  include examination of the items listed in Appendix II of the OCE  guidelines, electrical and mechanical equipment for operation of the  control facilities, reservoir area, downstream channel in the vicinity  of the dam and any other significant feature to determine how these  features affect the risk of failure of the dam. The inspection shall be  conducted in a systematic manner to minimize the possibility of any  significant feature being overlooked. The visual inspection checklist  provided by the Contracting Officer shall be used as a guide to document  the examination of each significant feature.</p><p class="depth0">Particular attention shall be given to detecting evidence of  leakage, erosion, seepage, slope instability, undue settlement,  displacement, tilting, cracking, deterioration, and improper functioning  of drains and relief wells. The degree and quality of maintenance and  regulating procedures for operation of the control facilities shall be  assessed. The design and existing condition of such control facilities  (i.e., spillway, outlet works, etc.) shall be evaluated. An assessment  of the degree of siltation that is evident and its effect on the dam's  reservoir shall be performed. Photographs and drawings should be used to  record conditions in order to minimize written descriptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Engineering Analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evaluation of Hydraulic and Hydrologic (H&H;) Features.  Evaluation of the hydraulic and hydrological features of each dam shall  be based on criteria set forth in the OCE guidelines. If it is  determined that the available H&H; data are insufficient, the Contracting  Officer must be so informed and may exercise an option of requiring the  AE to perform an overtopping analysis at additional agreed-upon  compensation. The methodology to be used by the AE for this analysis  will be based on the OCE guidelines and subject to the approval of the  Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation of Structural Stability. The evaluation of structural  stability of each dam is to be based principally on existing conditions  as revealed by the visual inspection, available design and construction  information, and records of performance. The objectives are to determine  the existence of conditions, identifiable by visual inspection or from  records, which may pose a high risk of failure and to formulate  recommendations pertaining to the need for any remedial improvements,  additional studies, investigations, or analysis. The results of this  phase of the inspection must rely substantially upon the experience and  judgment of the inspecting engineer. Should it be determined that  sufficient data are not available for a reasonable evaluation of the  structural stability of a dam and appurtenances, the Contracting Officer  should be informed which information is required prior to attempting to  evaluate the risk of failure of the dam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation of Operational Features. Where critical mechanical/ electrical operating equipment is used in controlling the   reservoir of a dam, an evaluation of the operational characteristics of  this equipment from the standpoint of risk of failure must be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Evaluation of Reservoir Regulation Plan and Warning System. The  operational characteristics of each dam's existing reservoir regulation  plan and warning system in event of a threatened failure shall be  investigated.</p><p class="depth0">b. Emergency Situations. The Contracting Officer must be immediately  notified of any observed condition which is deemed to require immediate  remedial action. After being notified, the Contracting Officer will  contact the appropriate State personnel and will meet the AE at the site  to determine the appropriate course of action. This will not relieve the  AE of his responsibility to prepare a comprehensive inspection report at  the earliest practicable date.</p><p class="depth0">c. Qualifications of Investigators. The technical investigations  shall be conducted by licensed professional engineers with a minimum of  five years experience after licensing in the investigation, design and  contruction of earthfill, rockfill and concrete dams and/or in making  risk of failure evaluations of completed dams. These engineers must be  knowledgeable in the disciplines of hydrology, hydraulics, geotechnical,  electrical, mechanical and structural engineering, as necessary. All  field inspections should be conducted by engineers, engineering  geologists and other specialists who are knowledgeable in the  investigation, design, construction and operation of dams, including  experts on mechanical and electrical operation of gates and controls,  where needed.</p><p class="depth0">d. Preparation of Report. A formal report shall be prepared for each  dam inspected for submission to the Contracting Officer. Each report  should contain the information specified in OCE guidelines and any other  pertinent information. The recommended format provided by the  Contracting Officer shall be used to document each report. The signature  and registration identification of the professional engineer who  directed the investigation and who was responsible for evaluation of the  dam should be included in the report.</p><p class="depth0">4. Supervision and Approval of Work. All work performed under this  contract shall be subject to the review and approval of the Contracting  Officer or his designee. Meetings will be held on a regular basis in the  District office, during which the progress of inspections will be  discussed and questions relating to inspection reports previously  received by the Contracting Officer will be addressed. Reports will be  revised as necessary when required by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0">5. Coordination.
