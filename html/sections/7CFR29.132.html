When such review discloses an error in the certification, the inspector, sampler, or weigher concerned, or supervising official shall immediately correct the error by making an appropriate change in the certificate or by canceling the certificate and issuing a new certificate in lieu thereof. Any correction made on a certificate shall be initialed by the issuing official or by the supervising official. When a new certificate is issued for a lot of tobacco, the old certificate and copies thereof shall become null and void and shall not thereafter be used to represent the tobacco described therein.</p>
