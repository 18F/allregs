                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vessels with mechanical means of propulsion, or lighters,  barges, or other vessels without independent means of propulsion, shall  be assigned freeboards in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec.  42.13-1 to 42.20-75, inclusive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vessels carrying timber deck cargoes may be assigned, in  addition to the freeboards required by paragraph (a) of this section,  timber freeboards in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 42.25- 1 to 42.25-20, inclusive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vessels designed to carry sail, whether as the sole means of  propulsion or as a supplementary means, and tugs, shall be assigned  freeboards in accordance with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 42.13-1 to  42.20-75, inclusive, and such additional freeboards as determined  necessary by the Commandant under the procedure of paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vessels of wood or of composite construction, or of other  materials the use of which the Commandant has approved, or vessels whose  constructional features are such as to render the application of the  provisions of Sec. Sec. 42.13-1 to 42.25-20 unreasonable or  impracticable, shall be assigned freeboards as determined necessary by  the Commandant under the procedure of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements in Sec. Sec. 42.15-1 to 42.15-80, inclusive,  shall apply to every vessel to which a minimum freeboard is assigned.  Relaxations from these requirements may be granted to a vessel to which  a greater than minimum freeboard is assigned provided the safety  conditions of the vessel are determined to be satisfactory under  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In each case specified by paragraphs (c) to (e) inclusive of  this section, the assigning authority shall report to the Commandant the  specific matters in which the vessel is deficient or requires special  freeboard consideration due to design, arrangement, construction  materials, propulsive method, or relaxation of requirements in this  part. The report shall also furnish background data and recommendations  of the assigning authority (including freeboard additions), as will  enable the Commandant to reach a decision.
