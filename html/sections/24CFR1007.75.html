                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lender options--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification. If a borrower on a loan  guaranteed under this part defaults on the loan, the holder of the  guarantee certificate shall provide written notice of the default to  HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment. Upon providing the notice required under paragraph  (a)(1), of this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate shall  be entitled to payment under the guarantee (subject to the provisions of  this section) and may proceed to obtain payment in one of the following  manners:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foreclosure. The holder of the certificate may initiate  foreclosure proceedings (after providing written notice of that action  to HUD). Upon a final order by the court authorizing foreclosure and  submission to HUD of a claim for payment under the guarantee, HUD will  pay to the holder of the certificate the pro rata portion of the amount  guaranteed (as determined under Sec. 1007.60) plus reasonable fees and  expenses as approved by HUD. HUD's rights will be subrogated to the  rights of the holder of the guarantee, who shall assign the obligation  and security to HUD.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No foreclosure. Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in  which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of  this section continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of  the guarantee may submit to HUD a request to assign the obligation and  security interest to HUD in return for payment of the claim under the  guarantee. HUD may accept assignment of the loan if HUD determines that  the assignment is in the best interest of the United States. Upon  assignment, HUD will pay to the holder of the guarantee the pro rata  portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under Sec. 1007.60).  HUD's rights will be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the  guarantee, who   shall assign the obligation and security to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. Before any payment under a guarantee is made under  paragraph (a) of this section, the holder of the guarantee shall exhaust  all reasonable possibilities of collection. Upon payment, in whole or in  part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be  assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim  against the borrower or the United States. HUD will then take such  action to collect as HUD determines to be appropriate.</p>
