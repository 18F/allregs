                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A tax imposed by a State meets the requirements of  section 6362(e) and this section if in effect it provides that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (2), or (3) respectively, of  section 6362(e), and according to paragraph (b), (c), or (d),  respectively, of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The liability for a resident tax imposed by such State upon an  individual or trust which changes residence to another State in the  taxable year is determined according to section 6362(e)(4) and paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The rules relating to current collection of tax apply as  provided in section 6362(e)(5) and paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Residence of an individual--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph (b), an individual is  treated as a resident of a State with respect to a taxable year only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> His principal place of residence (as defined in subparagraph (2)  of this paragraph (b)) is within such State for a period of at least 135  consecutive days, at least 30 days of which are in such taxable year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a citizen or resident of the United States who  is not a resident of any State (determined as provided in subdivision  (i) of this subparagraph) with respect to such taxable year, his  domicile (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (b)) is in  such State for at least 30 days during such taxable year.  With respect to an individual who is a resident (determined as provided  in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) of more than one State during a  taxable year, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Principal place of residence--(i) Definition. For purposes of  subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this  section, the term ``principal place of residence'' shall mean the place  which is an individual's primary home. An individual's temporary absence  from his primary home shall not effect a change with respect thereto. On  the other hand, if an individual moves to another State, other than as a  mere transient or sojourner, he shall be treated as having changed the  location of his primary home.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. A has a city home and a country home. He resides in the  city home for 7 months of the year and uses the address of that home as  his legal residence for purposes of driver's license, automobile  registration, and voter registration. He resides in the country home 5  months of the year. His city home is considered his principal place of  residence.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. During the taxable year, B, a construction worker, is  employed at several different locations in different States. The  duration of each job on which he is employed ranges from a few weeks to  several months, and he knows when he accepts a job what its approximate  duration will be. He owns a house in State X which he uses as his legal  residence for purposes of driver's license, automobile registration, and  voter registration. In addition, his family lives there during the  entire year, and B lives there during periods between jobs. However, the  duration of the jobs and the distance between the job-sites and his  house require him to live in the   localities of the respective job-sites during the period of his  employment, although occasionally he returns to his house in State X on  weekends. B's house in State X is his principal place of residence  during all of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. C, a dependent of his parents who are residents of State  X, is a full-time student in a 4-year degree program at a college in  State Y. During the 9-month academic year, C lives on the college  campus, but he returns to his parents' home in State X for the summer  recess. C gives the State Y as his residence for purposes of his  driver's license and voter registration, but lists the address of his  parents' home in State X as his ``permanent address'' on the records of  the college which he attends. Although C's domicile remains at his  parents' home in State X, his presence in State Y cannot be regarded as  that of a mere transient or sojourner; accordingly, C's principal place  of residence is in State Y for that portion of the taxable year during  which he attends college.</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. D loses his job in State X, where he lived and worked for  many years. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to find other  employment in State X, he accepts a job in State Y. D gives up his  apartment in State X and moves to State Y upon commencing his new job;  however, he intends to continue to explore available employment  opportunities in State X so that he may return there as soon as an  opportunity to do so arises. D changes his principal place of residence  when he moves to State Y.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Domicile defined. For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this  paragraph (b), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the term  ``domicile'' shall mean an individual's fixed or permanent home. An  individual acquires a domicile in a place by living there; even for a  brief period of time, with no definite present intention of later  removing therefrom. Residence without the requisite intention to remain  indefinitely will not suffice to change domicile, nor will intention to  change domicile effect such a change until accompanied by actual  removal. A domicile, once acquired, is maintained until a new domicile  is acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Period of residence--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An individual who becomes  a resident of a State pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  (b), or who is at the beginning of a taxable year a resident of a State  pursuant to such provision, shall be treated as continuing to be a  resident of such State through the end of the taxable year, unless,  prior thereto, such individual becomes a resident, under the principles  of subparagraph (1), of another State or a possession or foreign  country. In the event that the individual becomes a resident of such  another jurisdiction prior to the end of the taxable year, his residence  in such State shall be treated as ending on the day prior to the day on  which he becomes a resident of such other jurisdiction pursuant to  subparagraph (1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, has his principal place of  residence in State X from the beginning of 1976 through August 1, 1976,  when he gives up pemanently such principal place of residence. He spends  the remainder of 1976 traveling outside of the United States, but does  not become a resident of any other country. A is considered to be a  resident of State X for the entire year 1976.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that A  ceases his traveling and establishes his principal place of residence in  State Y on November 15, 1976. Assume, also, that A maintains that  principal place of residence for more than 135 consecutive days. Under  these circumstances, for his taxable year 1976, A is considered to be a  resident of State X from January 1 through November 14, and a resident  of State Y from November 15 through December 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rules. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No provision of subchapter E or the  regulations thereunder shall be construed to require or authorize the  treatment of a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident  Commissioner as a resident of a State other than the State which he  represents in Congress.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For special rules relating to members of the Armed Forces, see  paragraph (h) of Sec. 301.6362-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, maintains his principal  place of residence in State X from December 1, 1976, through April 15,  1977. Assuming that A was not a resident of any other jurisdiction at  any time during 1976, A is treated as a resident of State X for the  entire year 1976. Such result would obtain even if A was absent from  State X on vacation for some portion of December 1976. Moreover, such  result would obtain even if it is assumed that A was a domiciliary of  State Y from January 1, 1976, through April 15,   1977, because an individual's domicile does not determine his residence  so long as residence in one State for the taxable year can be determined  from the general rule stated in the first sentence of paragraph (b)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 (including the fact  of A's domicile in State Y), except that A maintained his principal  place of residence in State Z from September 15, 1975, through January  31, 1976, inclusive. With respect to the year 1976, A is treated as a  resident of State Z from January 1 through November 30, and as a  resident of State X from December 1 through December 31. A's liability  for the qualified taxes of the respective States for 1976 shall be  determined pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Residence of an estate. An estate of an individual is treated as  a resident of the last State of which such individual was a resident, as  determined under the rules of paragraph (b) of this section, prior to  his death. However, the estate of an individual who was not a resident  of any State (as determined without regard to the 30-day requirement in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section) immediately prior to his death, and  who was not a resident of any State at any time during the 3-year period  ending on the date of his death, is not treated as a resident of any  State. For purposes of determining the decedent's last State of  residence, the rules of paragraph (b) shall be applied irrespective of  whether subchapter E was in effect at the time the period of 135  consecutive days of residence began, or whether the decedent's last  State of residence is a State electing to enter into an agreement  pursuant to subchapter E. The determination of the State of residence of  an estate pursuant to this paragraph shall not be governed by any  determination under State law as to which State is treated as the  residence or domicile of the decedent for purposes other than its  individual income tax (such as liability for State inheritance tax or  jurisdiction of probate proceedings).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Residence of a trust--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State of residence  of a trust shall be determined by reference to the circumstances of the  individual who, by either an inter-vivos transfer or a testamentary  transfer, is deemed to be the ``principal contributor'' to the trust  under the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If only one individual has ever contributed assets to the  trust, including the assets which were transferred to the trust at its  inception, then such individual is the principal contributor to the  trust. However, if on any day subsequent to the initial creation of the  trust, such trust receives assets having a value greater than the  aggregate value of all assets theretofore contributed to it, then the  trust shall be deemed (for the limited purpose of determining the State  of residence) to have been ``created'' anew, and the individual who on  the day of such creation contributed more (in value) than any other  individual contributed on that day shall become the principal  contributor to the trust. When a trust is created anew, all references  in this paragraph to the creation of the trust shall be construed as  referring to the most recent creation. For purposes of this paragraph,  the value of any asset shall be its fair market value on the day that it  was contributed to the trust; any subsequent appreciation or  depreciation in the value of the asset shall be disregarded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testamentary trust. A trust with respect to which a deceased  individual is the principal contributor by reason of property passing on  his death is treated as a resident of the last State of which such  individual was a resident, as determined under the rules of paragraph  (b) of this section, before his death. However, if such deceased  individual was not a resident of any State (as determined without regard  to the 30-day requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section)  immediately prior to his death, and was not a resident of any State at  any time during the 3-year period ending on the date of his death, then  a testamentary trust of which he is the principal contributor by reason  of property passing on his death is not treated as a resident of any  State. All property passing on the transferor's death is treated for  this purpose as a contribution made to the trust on the date of death,  regardless of when the property is actually paid over to the trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nontestamentary trust. A trust which is not a trust described in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (d), is treated as a resident of the  State in which the principal contributor to the trust, during the 3-year  period ending on the date of the creation of the trust, had his  principal place of residence for an aggregate number of days longer than  the aggregate number of days he had his principal place of residence in  any other State. However, if the principal contributor to such a trust  was not a resident of any State at any time during such 3-year period,  then the trust is not treated as a resident of any State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special rules. If the application of the provisions of the  foregoing subparagraphs of this paragraph results in a determination of  more than one State of residence for a trust, or does not provide a rule  by which the residence or nonresidence of the trust can be determined,  then the determination of the State of residence of such trust shall be  made according to the rules of the applicable subdivision of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If, at the time of creation of the trust, 50 percent or more in  value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust  shall be treated as a resident of the State in which more of the real  property (in value) which was in the trust at such time was located than  any other State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, at the time of creation of the trust, less than 50 percent  in value of the trust corpus consists of real property, then the trust  shall be treated as a resident of the State in which, at such time, the  trustee, if an individual, had his principal place of residence, or, if  a corporation, had its principal place of business. If there were two or  more trustees, then the foregoing sentence shall be applied by reference  to the principal places of residence, or of business, of the majority of  trustees who had authority to make investment and other management  decisions for the trust.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If, after application of the provisions of subdivisions (i)  and (ii) of this subparagraph, the State of residence of the trust still  cannot be ascertained, then the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall  determine the State of residence of such trust for purposes of qualified  taxes. Such determination shall be made by reference to the number of  significant contacts each State had with the trust at the time of its  creation. Significant contacts shall include the principal place of  residence of the principal contributor or contributors to the trust, the  principal place of residence or business of the trustee (or trustees),  the situs of the assets of which the trust corpus was composed, and the  location from which management decisions emanated with respect to the  business and investment interests of the trusts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A created a trust in 1950 by transferring to it certain  stock in a corporation. At the time of such transfer, the stock had a  fair market value of $1,000. A at all relevant times had his principal  place of residence in State X, and accordingly the trust is treated as a  resident of such State for qualified tax purposes. As of January 1,  1977, the stock originally contributed by A, which was at all times the  only property in the trust, has a fair market value of $3,000. On such  date, B, who has had his principal place of residence in State Y for  more than 3 years, contributes to the trust property having a fair  market value of $1,200. For purposes of determining the identity of the  principal contributor to the trust and the State of residence of the  trust, the stock contributed by A in 1950 continues to be valued for  such purposes at $1,000. Thus, the trust is treated as being created  anew on January 1, 1977, with B as the principal contributor, and with  State Y as its State of residence.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. C has his principal place of residence in State X  continuously for many years, until August 1, 1978, when he establishes  his principal place of residence in State Y. The change of residence is  intended to be permanent, and C has no further contact with State X  after such change. On January 1, 1980, C creates a nontestamentary  trust. During the 3-year period ending on such date C had his principal  place of residence in State X for 576 days, and in State Y for 519 days.  Therefore, the trust is treated as a resident of State X.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Liability for tax on change of residence during taxable year-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If, under the principles contained in paragraph (b) or  (d) of this section, an individual or trust becomes a resident, or  ceases to be a resident, of a State,   and is also a resident of another jurisdiction outside of such State  during the same taxable year, the liability of such individual or trust  for the resident tax of such State shall be determined by multiplying  the amount which would be his or its liability for tax (computed after  allowing the nonrefundable credits (i.e., credits not corresponding to  the credits referred to in section 6401(b) available against the tax))  if he or it had been a resident of such State for the entire taxable  year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days he or  it was a resident of such State during the taxable year, and the  denominator of which is the total number of days in the taxable year.  The preceding sentence shall not apply by reason of the fact that an  individual is born or dies during the taxable year, or by reason of the  fact that a trust comes into existence or ceases to exist during the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Residence determined by domicile. When an individual is treated  as a resident of a State by reason of being domiciled in such State,  pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, then the numerator of  the fraction provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (e), shall  be the number of days the individual was domiciled in the State during  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, is a resident of State X  continuously for many years prior to March 15, 1977. On such date, A  retires and establishes a new principal place of residence in State Y. A  earns $6,000 in 1977 prior to March 15, but receives no taxable income  for the remainder of such year. If A had been a resident of State X for  the entire taxable year 1977, his liability with respect to the  qualified tax of such State (computed after allowing the nonrefundable  credits available against the tax) would be $600. If he had been a  resident of State Y for the entire taxable year 1977, his liability with  respect to the qualified tax on that State (computed similarly) would be  $400. Pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section, A's  liabilities for State qualified taxes for 1977 are as follows:  Liability for State X tax = $600 x 73 / 365 = $120  Liability for State Y Tax=$400 x 292 / 365 = $320.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Current collection of tax. The State tax laws shall contain  provisions for methods of current collection with respect to individuals  which correspond to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954  with respect to such current collection, including chapter 24 (relating  to the collection of income tax at source on wages) and sections 6015,  6073, 6153, and other provisions of the Code relating to declarations  (and amendments thereto) and payments of estimated income tax. Except as  otherwise provided by Federal statute (see paragraphs (h), (i), and (j)  of Sec. 301.6362-7), in applying such provisions of the State tax laws:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a resident tax, an individual shall be subject to  the current collection provisions if either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> He is a resident of the State within the meaning of paragraph  (b) of this section, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> He has his principal place of residence (as defined in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within the State,  And it is reasonable to expect him to have it within the State for 30  days or more during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a nonresident tax, an individual shall be subject  to the current collection provisions if he does not meet either  description relating to an individual in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph (f), if he is not exempt from liability for the tax by reason  for a reciprocal agreement between the State of which he is a resident  and the State imposing the tax, and if it is reasonable to expect him to  receive wage or other business income derived from sources within the  State imposing the tax (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 301.6362-5)  for services performed on 30 days or more of the taxable year.  For additional rules relating to withholding see paragraph (d) of Sec.  301.6361-1.  [T.D. 7577, 43 FR 59369, Dec. 20, 1978]</p>
