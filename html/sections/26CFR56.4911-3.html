                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition of term ``expenditures for''--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. This  Sec. 56.4911-3 contains allocation rules regarding what portion of a  lobbying communication's costs is a direct lobbying expenditure, what  portion is a grass roots expenditure and what portion is, in certain  cases, a nonlobbying expenditure. Except as otherwise indicated in this  paragraph (a), all costs of preparing a direct or grass roots lobbying  communication are included as expenditures for direct or grass roots  lobbying. Expenditures for a direct or grass roots lobbying  communication (``lobbying expenditures'') include amounts paid or  incurred as current or deferred compensation for an employee's services  attributable to the direct or grass roots lobbying communication, and  the allocable portion of administrative, overhead, and other general  expenditures attributable to the direct or grass roots lobbying  communication. For example, except as otherwise provided in this  paragraph (a), all expenditures for researching, drafting, reviewing,  copying, publishing and mailing a direct or grass roots lobbying  communication, as well as an allocable share of overhead expenses, are  included as expenditures for direct or grass roots lobbying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of mixed purpose expenditures--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nonmembership  communications. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this  section, lobbying expenditures for a communication that also has a bona  fide nonlobbying purpose must include all costs attributable to those  parts of the communication that are on the same specific subject as the  lobbying message. All costs attributable to those parts of the  communication that are not on the same specific subject as the lobbying  message are not included as lobbying expenditures for allocation  purposes. Whether or not a portion of a communication is on the same  specific subject as the lobbying message will depend on the surrounding  facts and circumstances. In general, a portion of a communication will  be on the same specific subject as the lobbying message if that portion  discusses an activity or specific issue that would be directly affected  by the specific legislation that is the subject of the lobbying message.  Moreover, discussion of the background or consequences of the specific  legislation, or discussion of the background or consequences of an  activity or specific issue affected by the specific legislation, is also  considered to be on the same specific subject as the lobbying  communication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Membership communications. In the case of lobbying expenditures  for a communication that also has a bona fide nonlobbying purpose and  that is sent only or primarily to members, an electing public charity  must make a reasonable allocation between the amount expended for the  lobbying purpose and the amount expended for the nonlobbying purpose. An  electing public charity that includes as a lobbying expenditure only the  amount expended for the specific sentence or sentences that encourage  the recipient to take action with respect to legislation has not made a  reasonable allocation. For purposes of this paragraph, a communication  is sent only or primarily to members if more than half of the recipients  of the communication are members of the electing public charity making  the communication within the meaning of Sec. 56.4911-5. See Sec.  56.4911-5 for separate rules on communications sent only or primarily to  members. Nothing in this paragraph (a) shall change any allocation  required by Sec. 56.4911-5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allocation of mixed lobbying. If a communication (to which Sec.  56.4911-5 does not apply) is both a direct lobbying communication and a  grass roots lobbying communication, the communication will be treated as  a grass roots lobbying communication except to the extent that the  electing public charity demonstrates that the communication was made  primarily for direct lobbying purposes, in which case a reasonable  allocation shall be made between the direct and the grass roots lobbying  purposes served by the communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. See Sec. 56.4911-5 for special rules applying to the member  communications described in some of the following examples.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Organization R makes the services of E, one of its paid  executives, available to S, an organization described in section  501(c)(4) of the Code. E works for several weeks to assist S in  developing materials that urge voters to contact their congressional  representatives to indicate their support for specific legislation. In  performing this work, E uses office space and clerical assistance  provided by R. R pays full salary and benefits to E during this period  and receives no reimbursement from S for these payments or for the other  facilities and assistance provided. All expenditures of R, including  allocable office and overhead expenses, that are attributable to this  assignment are grass roots expenditures because E was engaged in an  attempt to influence legislation.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. An organization distributes primarily to nonmembers a  pamphlet with two articles on unrelated subjects. The total cost of  preparing, printing and mailing the pamphlet is $11,000, $1,000 for  preparation and $10,000 for printing and mailing. The cost of preparing  one article, a nonlobbying communication, is $600. The article is  printed on three of the four pages in the pamphlet. The cost of  preparing the second article, a grassroots lobbying communication that  addresses only one specific subject, is $400. This article is printed on  one page of the four page pamphlet. In this situation, $400 of  preparation costs and $2,500 (25% of $10,000) of printing and mailing  costs are expenditures for a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that the  pamphlet is distributed only to members. In addition, assume the second  article states that the recipient members should contact their  congressional representatives. The organization allocates $400 of  preparation costs and $2,500 of printing and mailing costs as  expenditures for direct lobbying (see Sec. 56.4911-5(c)). The  allocation is reasonable for purposes of Sec. 56.4911-3(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Organization J places a full-page advertisement in a  newspaper. The advertisement urges passage of pending legislation to  build three additional nuclear powered submarines, and states that  readers should write their Congressional representatives in favor of the  legislation. The advertisement also provides a general description of  J's purposes and activities, invites readers to become members of J and  asks readers to contribute money to J. Except for the cost of the  portion of the advertisement describing J's purposes and activities and  the portion specifically seeking members and contributions, the entire  cost of the advertisement is an expenditure for a grass roots lobbying  communication, because the entire advertisement, except for the lines  specifically describing J and specifically seeking members and  contributions, is on the same specific subject as the grass roots  lobbying message.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4), except that J  places in the newspaper two separate half-page advertisements instead of  one full-page advertisement. One of the two advertisements discusses the  need for three additional nuclear powered submarines and urges readers  to write their Congressional representatives in favor of the pending  legislation to build the three submarines. The other advertisement  contains only the membership and fundraising appeals, along with a  general description of J's purposes and activities. The half-page  advertisement urging readers to write to Congress is a grass roots  lobbying communication and all of J's expenditures for producing and  placing that advertisement are expenditures for a grass roots lobbying  communication. J's expenditures for the other half-page advertisement  are not expenditures for a grass roots or direct lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (4), except that the  communication by J is in a letter mailed only to members of J, rather  than in newspaper advertisement, and the invitation to become a member  of J is an invitation to join a new membership category. In addition,  assume that the communication states that the member recipients should  ask nonmembers to write their Congressional representatives. J allocates  one-half of the cost of the mailing as an expenditure for a grass roots  lobbying communication (see Sec. 56.4911-5(d)). Because the  communication had both bona fide nonlobbying (e.g., membership  solicitation and fundraising) purposes as well as lobbying purposes, J's  allocation of one-half of the cost of the communication to grass roots  lobbying and one-half to nonlobbying is reasonable for purposes of Sec.  56.4911-3(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. A particular monthly issue of organization X's  newsletter, which is distributed mainly to nonmembers of X, has three  articles of equal length. The first article is a grass roots lobbying  communication, the sole specific subject of which is pending legislation  to help protect seals from being slaughtered in certain foreign  countries. The second article discusses the rapid decline in the world's  whale population, particularly because of the illegal hunting of whales  by foreign countries. The third article deals with air pollution and the  acid rain problem in North America. Because the first article is a grass  roots lobbying communication, all of the costs allocable to that article  (e.g., one-   third of the newsletter's printing and mailing costs) are lobbying  expenditures. The second article is not a lobbying communication and the  pending legislation relating to seals addressed in the first article  does not affect the illegal whale hunting activities. Because the second  and third articles are not lobbying communications and are also not on  the same specific subject as the first article, no portion of the costs  attributable to those articles is a grass roots lobbying expenditure.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Organization T, a nonmembership organization, prepares a  three page document that is mailed to 3,000 persons on T's mailing list.  The first two pages of the three page document, titled ``The Need for  Child Care,'' support the need for additional child care programs, and  include statistics on the number of children living in homes where both  parents work or in homes with a single parent. The two pages also make  note of the inadequacy of the number of day care providers to meet the  needs of these parents. The third page of the document, titled ``H.R.  1,'' indicates T's support of H.R. 1, a bill pending in the U.S. House  of Representatives. The document states that H.R. 1 will provide for  $10,000,000 in additional subsidies to child care providers, primarily  for those providers caring for lower income children. The third page of  the document also notes that H.R. 1 includes new federal standards  regulating the quality of child care providers. The document ends with  T's request that recipients contact their congressional representative  in support of H.R. 1. The entire three page document is on the same  specific subject, and, therefore, all expenditures of preparing and  distributing the three page document are grass roots lobbying  expenditures.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. Assume the same facts as in Example (8), except that the  document has a fourth page. The fourth page does not refer to the  general need for child care or the specific need for additional child  care providers. Instead, the fourth page advocates that a particular  federal agency commence, under its existing statutory authority,  licensing of day care providers in order to promote safe and effective  child care. The cost of the fourth page is not a lobbying expenditure.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. Assume the same facts as in Example (8), except that T  is a membership organization, 75 percent of the recipients of the three  page document are members of T, and 25 percent of the recipients are  nonmembers and are not subscribers within the meaning of Sec. 56.4911- 5(f)(5). Assume also that the document states that readers should write  to Congress, but does not state that the readers should urge nonmembers  to write to Congress. T treats the document as having a bona fide  nonlobbying purpose, the purpose of educating its members about the need  for child care. Accordingly, T allocates one-half of the cost of  preparing and distributing the document as a lobbying expenditure (see  Sec. 56.4911-5(e)(2)(i)), of which 75 percent is a direct lobbying  expenditure (see Sec. 56.4911-5(e)(2)(iii)) and 25 percent is a grass  roots lobbying expenditure (see Sec. 56.4911-5(e)(2)(ii)). The  remaining one-half is allocated as a nonlobbying expenditure. T's  allocation is reasonable for purposes of Sec. 56.4911-3(a)(2)(ii) and  is correct for purposes of Sec. 56.4911-5(e).</p><p class="depth2">Example 11. Assume the same facts as in Example (10), except that T  allocates one percent of the cost of preparing and distributing the  document as a lobbying expenditure (for purposes of Sec. 56.4911- 5(e)(2)) and 99 percent as a nonlobbying expenditure. T's allocation is  based upon the fact that out of 200 lines in the document, only two  lines state that the recipient should contact legislators about the  pending legislation. T's allocation is unreasonable for purposes of  Sec. 56.4911-3(a)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth2">Example 12. Organization F, a nonmembership organization, sends a  one page letter to all persons on its mailing list. The only subject of  the letter is the organization's opposition to a pending bill allowing  private uses of certain national parks. The letter requests recipients  to send letters opposing the bill to their congressional  representatives. A second one page letter is sent in the same envelope.  The second letter discusses the broad educational activities and  publications of the organization in all areas of environmental  protection and ends by requesting the recipient to make a financial  contribution to organization F. Since the separate second letter is on a  different subject from the lobbying letter, and the letters are of equal  length, 50 percent of the mailing costs must be allocated as an  expenditure for a grass roots lobbying communication.</p><p class="depth2">Example 13. Assume the same facts as in Example (12), except that F  is a membership organization and the letters in question are sent  primarily (90 percent) to members. The other 10 percent of the  recipients are nonmembers and are not subscribers within the meaning of  Sec. 56.4911-5(f)(5). Assume also that the first letter does not state  that readers should urge nonmembers to write to legislators. F allocates  one-half of the mailing costs as a lobbying expenditure, of which 90  percent is a direct lobbying expenditure and 10 percent is a grass roots  lobbying expenditure (see Sec. 56.4911-5(e)(2)). F's allocation is  reasonable for purposes of Sec. 56.4911-3(a)(2)(ii) and is correct for  purposes of Sec. 56.4911-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certain transfers treated as lobbying expenditures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transfer  earmarked for grass roots purposes. A transfer is a grass roots  expenditure to the extent that it is earmarked (as defined in Sec.  56.4911-4(f)(4)) for grass roots lobbying   purposes and is not described in Sec. 56.4911-4(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  shall not apply to any expenditure described in Sec. 56.4911-4(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certain transfers to noncharities that lobby--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limited  application of paragraph (c)(3)--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In general. This paragraph (c)(3)  applies only to transfers for less than fair market value from an  electing public charity to any noncharity that makes lobbying  expenditures. A noncharity is any entity that is not described in  section 501(c)(3). In order for this paragraph to apply, the electing  public charity must transfer to a noncharity more in value than it  receives in return. For example, this paragraph does not apply to an  electing public charity's fair market value payment of rent to a  landlord. However, this paragraph does apply where an electing public  charity and a noncharity share office space and the electing public  charity pays more than fair market value rent to the noncharity.  Similarly, this paragraph applies where an electing public charity sells  goods or services to a noncharity for less than fair market value. See  paragraphs (c)(3)(i) (B), (C) and (D) of this section for exceptions  where non-fair market value transfers are not covered by this paragraph  (c)(3). See paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section to determine the  amount of any non-fair market value transfer covered by this paragraph  (c)(3). See paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section for the rules that  apply to transfers governed by this paragraph (c)(3).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Exception for controlled grants. Notwithstanding paragraph  (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, this paragraph (c)(3) does not apply where  an electing public charity makes a grant to a noncharity that is a  controlled grant (as defined in Sec. 56.4911-4(f)(3)).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Exception for transfers that artificially inflate exempt purpose  expenditures. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section,  this paragraph (c)(3) does not apply where an electing public charity  makes a grant to a noncharity that is an expenditure described in Sec.  56.4911-4(e) (relating to grants that artificially inflate exempt  purpose expenditures).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em>:</p><p class="depth5">Example. Organization P is an educational organization dedicated to  preserving the environment. One of P's activities is educating the  public about the benefits of installing cost-effective passive solar  energy systems, thereby helping to preserve the environment. P charges  for its extensive literature and advice, but the charges are less than  the fair market value of the literature and advice. P makes its  literature and advice widely available to individual members of the  general public by advertising in various media and by pamphlets  distributed in various areas. P annually provides its literature and  advice for less than fair market value to 500 wholly unrelated families,  businesses, and tax-exempt organizations. Several of the businesses and  tax-exempt organizations make lobbying expenditures within the meaning  of section 4911. P's provision of its goods and services to these  entities is not covered by this paragraph (c)(3) (and thus does not give  rise to a lobbying expenditure by P under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Determination of amount of transfer governed by paragraph  (c)(3). Where an electing public charity receives nothing of value in  return for its transfer, the amount of the transfer governed by this  paragraph (c)(3) is the greater of the fair market value or the cost of  the goods or services transferred to the noncharity. Where the  noncharity transfers something of value to the electing public charity  in return for the charity's transfer, but that payment is less than the  fair market value of the charity's transfer to the noncharity, the  amount of the transfer governed by this paragraph (c)(3) is the excess  of: first, the greater of the fair market value or cost of the goods or  services transferred to the noncharity over, second, the value of the  amount transferred to the charity. For example, if an electing public  charity transfers $10,000 of goods and services to a noncharity that  makes lobbying expenditures in return for payment by the noncharity of  $2,000, the amount of the transfer governed by this paragraph (c)(3) is  $8,000.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> (A), (B) and (C) of  this section. In applying those paragraphs, the expenditures of the  transferee will be determined as if the regulations under section 4911  applied to the transferee. This paragraph (c)(3) discusses only when  certain transfers are lobbying expenditures by the transferor. This  paragraph does not address other issues that may arise when an electing  public charity makes a noncontrolled grant to a noncharity. Nothing in  this paragraph (c)(3) shall be used to interpret issues relating to  noncontrolled grants by charities to noncharities, such as whether the  noncontrolled grant is consistent with the continued tax-exempt status  of the electing public charity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Transfers treated as grass roots expenditures. The transfer is  treated as a grass roots expenditure to the extent of the lesser of two  amounts: The amount of the transfer and the amount of the transferee's  grass roots expenditures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Transfers treated as direct lobbying expenditures. If the  transfer is greater than the transferee's grass roots expenditures, the  excess is treated as a direct lobbying expenditure, but only to the  extent of the transferee's direct lobbying expenditures. (If, however,  the transfer is less than the transferee's grass roots expenditures,  none of the transfer is a direct lobbying expenditure.)</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Transfers treated as nonlobbying. If the transfer is greater  than the sum of the transferee's grass roots and direct lobbying  expenditures, the excess of the transfer over those lobbying expenses is  not a lobbying expenditure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (c)(3):</p><p class="depth4">Example. Organization C, an electing public charity, shares employee  E with N, a noncharity that makes lobbying expenditures. N's grass roots  expenditures are $5,000 and its direct lobbying expenditures are  $25,000. Each organization pays one-half of the $100,000 in direct and  overhead costs associated with E. E devotes one-quarter of his time to C  and three-quarters of his time to N. In substance, this arrangement is a  transfer (for less than fair market value) from C to N in the amount of  $25,000 (one-quarter of the $100,000 of direct and overhead costs  associated with E's work). Accordingly, C is treated as having made a  $5,000 grass roots expenditure (the lesser of N's grass roots  expenditures ($5,000) or the amount of the transfer ($25,000)). C is  also treated as having made a $20,000 direct lobbying expenditure (the  lesser of N's direct lobbying expenditures ($25,000) or the remaining  amount of the transfer ($20,000)).</p>
