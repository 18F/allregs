                                Sec. 64.1190  Preferred carrier freezes.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A preferred carrier freeze (or freeze) prevents a change in a  subscriber's preferred carrier selection unless the subscriber gives the  carrier from whom the freeze was requested his or her express consent.  All local exchange carriers who offer preferred carrier freezes must  comply with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All local exchange carriers who offer preferred carrier freezes  shall offer freezes on a nondiscriminatory basis to all subscribers,  regardless of the subscriber's carrier selections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Preferred carrier freeze procedures, including any solicitation,  must clearly distinguish among telecommunications services (e.g., local  exchange, intraLATA toll, and interLATA toll) subject to a preferred  carrier freeze. The carrier offering the freeze must obtain separate  authorization for each service for which a preferred carrier freeze is  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Solicitation and imposition of preferred carrier freezes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  All carrier-provided solicitation and other materials regarding  preferred carrier freezes must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An explanation, in clear and neutral language, of what a  preferred carrier freeze is and what services may be subject to a  freeze;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the specific procedures necessary to lift a  preferred carrier freeze; an explanation that these steps are in  addition to the Commission's verification rules in Sec. Sec. 64.1120  and 64.1130 for changing a subscriber's preferred carrier selections;  and an explanation that the subscriber will be unable to make a change  in carrier selection unless he or she lifts the freeze.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An explanation of any charges associated with the preferred  carrier freeze.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No local exchange carrier shall implement a preferred carrier  freeze unless the subscriber's request to impose a freeze has first been  confirmed in accordance with one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The local exchange carrier has obtained the subscriber's written  or electronically signed authorization in a form that meets the  requirements of Sec. 64.1190(d)(3); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> through (D). Telecommunications carriers electing  to confirm preferred carrier freeze orders electronically shall  establish one or more toll-free telephone numbers exclusively for that  purpose. Calls to the number(s) will connect a subscriber to a voice  response unit, or similar mechanism that records the required  information regarding the preferred carrier freeze request, including  automatically recording the originating automatic numbering  identification; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An appropriately qualified independent third party has  obtained the subscriber's oral authorization to submit the preferred  carrier freeze and confirmed the appropriate verification data (e.g.,  the subscriber's date of birth or social security number) and the  information required in Sec. 64.1190(d)(3)(ii)(A) through (D). The  independent third party must not be owned, managed, or directly  controlled by the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent; must not  have any financial incentive to confirm preferred carrier freeze  requests for the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent; and must  operate in a location physically separate from the carrier or the  carrier's marketing agent. The content of the verification must include  clear and conspicuous confirmation that the subscriber has authorized a  preferred carrier freeze.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written authorization to impose a preferred carrier freeze. A  local exchange carrier may accept a subscriber's written and signed  authorization to impose a freeze on his or her preferred carrier  selection. Written authorization that does not conform with this section  is invalid and may not be used to impose a preferred carrier freeze.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The written authorization shall comply with Sec. Sec.  64.1130(b), (c), and (h) of the Commission's rules concerning the form  and content for letters of agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At a minimum, the written authorization must be printed with a  readable type of sufficient size to be clearly legible and must contain  clear and unambiguous language that confirms:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The subscriber's billing name and address and the telephone  number(s) to be covered by the preferred carrier freeze;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The decision to place a preferred carrier freeze on the  telephone number(s) and particular service(s). To the extent that a  jurisdiction allows the imposition of preferred carrier freezes on  additional preferred carrier selections (e.g., for local exchange,  intraLATA toll, and interLATA toll), the authorization must contain  separate statements regarding the particular selections to be frozen;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> That the subscriber understands that she or he will be unable to  make a change in carrier selection unless she or he lifts the preferred  carrier freeze; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> That the subscriber understands that any preferred carrier  freeze may involve a charge to the subscriber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures for lifting preferred carrier freezes. All local  exchange carriers who offer preferred carrier freezes must, at a  minimum, offer subscribers the following procedures for lifting a  preferred carrier freeze:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A local exchange carrier administering a preferred carrier  freeze must accept a subscriber's written or electronically signed  authorization stating his or her intent to lift a preferred carrier  freeze; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A local exchange carrier administering a preferred carrier  freeze must accept a subscriber's oral authorization stating her or his  intent to lift a preferred carrier freeze and must offer a mechanism  that allows a submitting carrier to conduct a three-way conference call  with the carrier administering the freeze and the subscriber in order to  lift a freeze. When engaged in oral authorization to lift a preferred  carrier freeze, the carrier administering the freeze shall confirm  appropriate verification data (e.g., the subscriber's date of birth or  social security number) and the subscriber's intent to lift the  particular freeze.
