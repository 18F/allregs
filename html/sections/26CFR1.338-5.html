                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides rules under section 338(b) to determine the adjusted grossed-up basis (AGUB) for target. AGUB is the amount for which new target is deemed to have purchased all of its assets in the deemed purchase under section 338(a)(2). AGUB is allocated among target's assets in accordance with Sec. 1.338-6 to determine the price at which the assets are deemed to have been purchased. When a subsequent increase or decrease with respect to an element of AGUB is required under general principles of tax law, redetermined AGUB is allocated among target's assets in accordance with Sec. 1.338-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of AGUB--(1) General rule. AGUB is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. AGUB is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The grossed-up basis in the purchasing corporation's recently purchased target stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The purchasing corporation's basis in nonrecently purchased target stock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The liabilities of new target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and amount of AGUB--(i) Original determination. AGUB is initially determined at the beginning of the day after the acquisition date of target. General principles of tax law apply in determining the timing and amount of the elements of AGUB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Original determination. AGUB is initially determined at the beginning of the day after the acquisition date of target. General principles of tax law apply in determining the timing and amount of the elements of AGUB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Redetermination of AGUB. AGUB is redetermined at such time and in such amount as an increase or decrease would be required, under general principles of tax law, with respect to an element of AGUB. For example, AGUB is redetermined because of an increase or decrease in the amount paid or incurred for recently purchased stock or nonrecently purchased stock or because liabilities not originally taken into account in determining AGUB are subsequently taken into account. An increase or decrease to one element of AGUB also may cause an increase or decrease to another element of AGUB. For example, if there is an increase in the amount paid or incurred for recently purchased stock after the acquisition date, any increase in the basis of nonrecently purchased stock because a gain recognition election was made is also taken into account when AGUB is redetermined. Increases or decreases with respect to the elements of AGUB result in the reallocation of AGUB among target's assets under Sec. 1.338-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In Year 1, T, a manufacturer, purchases a customized delivery truck from X with purchase money indebtedness having a stated principal amount of $100,000. P acquires all of the stock of T in Year 3 for $700,000 and makes a section 338 election for T. Assume T has no liabilities other than its purchase money indebtedness to X. In Year 4, when T is neither insolvent nor in a title 11 case, T and X agree to reduce the amount of the purchase money indebtedness to $80,000. Assume that the reduction would be a purchase price reduction under section 108(e)(5). T and X's agreement to reduce the amount of the purchase money indebtedness would, under general principles of tax law that would apply if the deemed asset sale had actually occurred, change the amount of liabilities of old target taken into account in determining its basis. Accordingly, AGUB is redetermined at the time of the reduction. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Thus the purchase price reduction affects the basis of the truck only indirectly, through the mechanism of Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7. See Sec. 1.338-4(b)(2)(iii) Example for the effect on ADSP.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. T, an accrual basis taxpayer, is a chemical manufacturer. In Year 1, T is obligated to remediate environmental contamination at the site of one of its plants. Assume that all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy but economic performance has not occurred with respect to the liability within the meaning of section 461(h). P acquires all of the stock of T in Year 1 and makes a section 338 election for T. Assume that, if a corporation unrelated to T had actually purchased T's assets and assumed T's obligation to remediate the contamination, the corporation would not satisfy the economic performance requirements until Year 5. Under section 461(h), the assumed liability would not be treated as incurred and taken into account in basis until that time. The incurrence of the liability in Year 5 under the economic performance rules is an increase in the amount of liabilities properly taken into account in basis and results in the redetermination of AGUB. (Respecting ADSP, compare Sec. 1.461-4(d)(5), which provides that economic performance occurs for old T as the amount of the liability is properly taken into account in amount realized on the deemed asset sale. Thus ADSP is

not redetermined when new T satisfies the economic performance requirements.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Grossed-up basis of recently purchased stock. The purchasing corporation's grossed-up basis of recently purchased target stock (as defined in section 338(b)(6)(A)) is an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The purchasing corporation's basis in recently purchased target stock at the beginning of the day after the acquisition date determined without regard to the acquisition costs taken into account in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 100 minus the number that is the percentage of target stock (by value, determined on the acquisition date) attributable to the purchasing corporation's nonrecently purchased target stock, and the denominator of which is the number equal to the percentage of target stock (by value, determined on the acquisition date) attributable to the purchasing corporation's recently purchased target stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plus the acquisition costs the purchasing corporation incurred in connection with its purchase of the recently purchased stock that are capitalized in the basis of such stock (e.g., brokerage commissions and any similar costs incurred by the purchasing corporation to acquire the stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Basis of nonrecently purchased stock; gain recognition election--(1) No gain recognition election. In the absence of a gain recognition election under section 338(b)(3) and this section, the purchasing corporation retains its basis in the nonrecently purchased stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No gain recognition election. In the absence of a gain recognition election under section 338(b)(3) and this section, the purchasing corporation retains its basis in the nonrecently purchased stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedure for making gain recognition election. A gain recognition election may be made for nonrecently purchased stock of target (or a target affiliate) only if a section 338 election is made for target (or the target affiliate). The gain recognition election is made by attaching a gain recognition statement to a timely filed Form 8023 for target. The gain recognition statement must contain the information specified in the form and its instructions. The gain recognition election is irrevocable. If a section 338(h)(10) election is made for target, see Sec. 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(1) (providing that the purchasing corporation is automatically deemed to have made a gain recognition election for its nonrecently purchased T stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect of gain recognition election--(i) In general. If the purchasing corporation makes a gain recognition election, then for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the purchasing corporation makes a gain recognition election, then for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The purchasing corporation is treated as if it sold on the acquisition date the nonrecently purchased target stock for the basis amount determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The purchasing corporation's basis on the acquisition date in nonrecently purchased target stock immediately following the deemed sale in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section is the basis amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis amount. The basis amount is equal to the amount in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section (the purchasing corporation's grossed-up basis in recently purchased target stock at the beginning of the day after the acquisition date determined without regard to the acquisition costs taken into account in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the percentage of target stock (by value, determined on the acquisition date) attributable to the purchasing corporation's nonrecently purchased target stock and the denominator of which is 100 percent minus the numerator amount. Thus, if target has a single class of outstanding stock, the purchasing corporation's basis in each share of nonrecently purchased target stock after the gain recognition election is equal to the average price per share of the purchasing corporation's recently purchased target stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Losses not recognized. Only gains (unreduced by losses) on the nonrecently purchased target stock are recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Stock subject to election. The gain recognition election applies to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All nonrecently purchased target stock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any nonrecently purchased stock in a target affiliate having the same

acquisition date as target if such target affiliate stock is held by the purchasing corporation on such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Liabilities of new target--(1) In general. The liabilities of new target are the liabilities of target as of the beginning of the day after the acquisition date (but see Sec. 1.338-1(d) (regarding certain transactions on the acquisition date)). In order to be taken into account in AGUB, a liability must be a liability of target that is properly taken into account in basis under general principles of tax law that would apply if new target had acquired its assets from an unrelated person for consideration that included discharge of the liabilities of that unrelated person. Such liabilities may include liabilities for the tax consequences resulting from the deemed sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The liabilities of new target are the liabilities of target as of the beginning of the day after the acquisition date (but see Sec. 1.338-1(d) (regarding certain transactions on the acquisition date)). In order to be taken into account in AGUB, a liability must be a liability of target that is properly taken into account in basis under general principles of tax law that would apply if new target had acquired its assets from an unrelated person for consideration that included discharge of the liabilities of that unrelated person. Such liabilities may include liabilities for the tax consequences resulting from the deemed sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and amount of liabilities. The time for taking into account liabilities of old target in determining AGUB and the amount of the liabilities taken into account is determined as if new target had acquired its assets from an unrelated person for consideration that included the discharge of its liabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interaction with deemed sale tax consequences. In general, see Sec. 1.338-4(e). Although ADSP and AGUB are not necessarily linked, if an increase in the amount realized for recently purchased stock of target is taken into account after the acquisition date, and if the tax on the deemed sale tax consequences is a liability of target, any increase in that liability is also taken into account in redetermining AGUB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service. In connection with the examination of a return, the Commissioner may increase (or decrease) AGUB under the authority of section 338(b)(2) and allocate such amounts to target's assets under the authority of section 338(b)(5) so that AGUB and the basis of target's assets properly reflect the cost to the purchasing corporation of its interest in target's assets. Such items may include distributions from target to the purchasing corporation, capital contributions from the purchasing corporation to target during the 12-month acquisition period, or acquisitions of target stock by the purchasing corporation after the acquisition date from minority shareholders. See also Sec. 1.338-1(d) (regarding certain transactions on the acquisition date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this section. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (g), T has no liabilities other than the tax liability for the deemed sale tax consequences, T shareholders incur no costs in selling the T stock, and P incurs no costs in acquiring the T stock. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before July 1 of Year 1, P purchases 10 of the 100 shares of T stock for $5,000. On July 1 of Year 2, P purchases 80 shares of T stock for $60,000 and makes a section 338 election for T. As of July 1 of Year 2, T's only asset is raw land with an adjusted basis to T of $50,400 and a fair market value of $100,000. T has no loss or tax credit carryovers to Year 2. T's marginal tax rate for any ordinary income or net capital gain resulting from the deemed asset sale is 34 percent. The 10 shares purchased before July 1 of Year 1 constitute nonrecently purchased T stock with respect to P's qualified stock purchase of T stock on July 1 of Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ADSP formula as applied to these facts is the same as in Sec. 1.338-4(g) Example 1. Accordingly, the ADSP for T is $87,672.72. The existence of nonrecently purchased T stock is irrelevant for purposes of the ADSP formula, because that formula treats P's nonrecently purchased T stock in the same manner as T stock not held by P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The total tax liability resulting from T's deemed asset sale, as calculated under the ADSP formula, is $12,672.72.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If P does not make a gain recognition election, the AGUB of new T's assets is $85,172.72, determined as follows (In the following formula below, GRP is the grossed-up basis in P's recently purchased T stock, BNP is P's basis in nonrecently purchased T stock, L is T's liabilities, and X is P's acquisition costs for the recently purchased T stock):
AGUB = GRP + BNP + L + XAGUB = $60,000 x [(1 - .1)/.8] + $5,000 + $12,672.72 + 0AGUB = $85,172.72</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If P makes a gain recognition election, the AGUB of new T's assets is $87,672.72, determined as follows:
AGUB = $60,000 x [(1 - .1)/.8] + $60,000 x [(1 - .1)/.8] x [.1/(1 - .1)]</p><p class="depth0">+ $12,672.72AGUB = $87,672.72</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The calculation of AGUB if P makes a gain recognition election may be simplified as follows:
AGUB = $60,000/.8 + $12,672.72AGUB = $87,672.72</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> As a result of the gain recognition election, P's basis in its nonrecently purchased T stock is increased from $5,000 to $7,500 (i.e., $60,000 x [(1 - .1)/.8] x [.1/(1 - .1)]). Thus, P recognizes a gain in Year 2 with respect to its nonrecently purchased T stock of $2,500 (i.e., $7,500 - $5,000).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1 of Year 1, P purchases one-third of the T stock. On March 1 of Year 1, T distributes a dividend to all of its shareholders. On April 15 of Year 1, P purchases the remaining T stock and makes a section 338 election for T. In appropriate circumstances, the Commissioner may decrease the AGUB of T to take into account the payment of the dividend and properly reflect the fair market value of T's assets deemed purchased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T's sole asset is a building worth $100,000. At this time, T has 100 shares of stock outstanding. On August 1 of Year 1, P purchases 10 of the 100 shares of T stock for $8,000. On June 1 of Year 2, P purchases 50 shares of T stock for $50,000. On June 15 of Year 2, P contributes a tract of land to the capital of T and receives 10 additional shares of T stock as a result of the contribution. Both the basis and fair market value of the land at that time are $10,800. On June 30 of Year 2, P purchases the remaining 40 shares of T stock for $40,000 and makes a section 338 election for T. The AGUB of T is $108,800.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To prevent the shifting of basis from the contributed property to other assets of T, the Commissioner may allocate $10,800 of the AGUB to the land, leaving $98,000 to be allocated to the building. See paragraph (f) of this section. Otherwise, applying the allocation rules of Sec. 1.338-6 would, on these facts, result in an allocation to the recently contributed land of an amount less than its value of $10,800, with the difference being allocated to the building already held by T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section is applicable to any qualified stock purchase or qualified stock disposition (as defined in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(6)) for which the acquisition date or disposition date (as defined in Sec. 1.336-1(b)(8)), respectively, is on or after May 15, 2013.
