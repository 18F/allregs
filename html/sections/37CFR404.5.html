However, this condition may be waived or modified if reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or if domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licenses shall contain such terms and conditions as the Federal agency determines are appropriate for the protection of the interests of the Federal Government and the public and are not in conflict with law or this part. The following terms and conditions apply to any license:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The duration of the license shall be for a period specified in the license agreement, unless sooner terminated in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any patent license may grant the licensee the right of enforcement of the licensed patent without joining the Federal agency as a party as determined appropriate in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The license may extend to subsidiaries of the licensee or other parties if provided for in the license but shall be nonassignable without approval of the Federal agency, except to the successor of that part of the licensee's business to which the invention pertains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The license may provide the licensee the right to grant sublicenses under the license, subject to the approval of the Federal agency. Each sublicense shall make reference to the license, including the rights retained by the Government, and a copy of such sublicense with any modifications thereto, shall be promptly furnished to the Federal agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The license shall require the licensee to carry out the plan for development or marketing of the invention, or both, to bring the invention to practical application within a reasonable time as specified in the license, and continue to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The license shall require the licensee to report periodically on the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization that are being made by the licensee, with particular reference to the plan submitted but only to the extent necessary to enable the agency to determine compliance with the terms of the license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where an agreement is obtained pursuant to Sec.  404.5(a)(2) that any products embodying the invention or produced through the use of the invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States, the license shall recite such an agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The license shall provide for the right of the Federal agency to terminate the license, in whole or in part, if the agency determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The licensee is not executing its commitment to achieve practical application of the invention, including commitments contained in any plan submitted in support of its request for a license and the licensee cannot otherwise demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Federal agency that it has taken, or can be expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Termination is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations issued after the date of the license and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the licensee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The licensee has willfully made a false statement of or willfully omitted a material fact in the license application or in any report required by the license agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The licensee commits a substantial breach of a covenant or provision contained in the license agreement, including the requirement in Sec.  404.5(a)(2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The licensee has been found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
