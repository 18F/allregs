                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of Sec. 21.50, an employment handicap will be  found to exist only if a CP or VRC determines that the individual meets  each of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vocational impairment. The individual has a vocational  impairment; that is, an impairment of the ability to prepare for,  obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with his or her  abilities, aptitudes, and interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effects of impairment not overcome. The individual has not  overcome the effects of the individual's impairment of employability  through employment in, or qualifying for employment in, an occupation  consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests. This  situation includes an individual who qualifies for a suitable job, but  who does not obtain or keep the job for reasons beyond his or her  control.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3102)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contribution of the service-connected disability(ies) to the  individual's overall vocational impairment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the service-connected disability(ies)  must contribute in substantial part to the individual's overall  vocational impairment. This means that the disability(ies) must have an  identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect on the overall  vocational impairment, but need not be the sole or primary cause of the  employment handicap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When determining the individual's overall vocational impairment,  the CP or VRC will consider the factors identified in Sec. 21.50(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For determinations made on applications for vocational  rehabilitation filed on or after March 30, 1995, but before October 9,  1996, the individual's service-connected disability(ies) need not  contribute to the individual's overall vocational impairment.
