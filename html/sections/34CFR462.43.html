                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Educational gain is measured by comparing the student's initial educational functioning level, as measured by the pre-test described in Sec.  462.41(b), with the student's educational functioning level as measured by the post-test described in Sec.  462.41(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Educational gain is measured by comparing the student's initial educational functioning level, as measured by the pre-test described in Sec.  462.41(b), with the student's educational functioning level as measured by the post-test described in Sec.  462.41(c).</p><p class="depth3">Example: A State's assessment policy requires its local eligible providers to test students in reading and numeracy. The student scores lower in reading than in numeracy. As described in Sec.  462.42(d)(1), the local eligible provider would use the student's reading

score to place the student in an educational functioning level. To measure educational gain, the local eligible provider would compare the reading score on the pre-test with the reading score on the post-test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A student is considered to have made an educational gain when the student's post-test indicates that the student has completed one or more educational functioning levels above the level in which the student was placed by the pre-test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a student is not post-tested, then no educational gain can be measured for that student and the local eligible provider must report the student in the same educational functioning level as initially placed for NRS reporting purposes.
