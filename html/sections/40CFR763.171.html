This requirement includes labeling all manufacturers', importers', and processors' stock-on-hand as of August 27, 1990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After August 25, 1995, manufacturers, importers, and processors of all asbestos-containing products that are identified in Sec. 763.165(b), shall label the products as specified in this subpart at the time of manufacture, import, or processing. This requirement includes

labeling all manufacturers', importers', and processors' stock-on-hand as of August 25, 1995.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The label shall be placed directly on the visible exterior of the wrappings and packaging in which the product is placed for sale, shipment, or storage. If the product has more than one layer of external wrapping or packaging, the label must be attached to the innermost layer adjacent to the product. If the innermost layer of product wrapping or packaging does not have a visible exterior surface larger than 5 square inches, either a tag meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section must be securely attached to the product's innermost layer of product wrapping or packaging, or a label must be attached to the next outer layer of product packaging or wrapping. Any products that are distributed in commerce to someone other than the end user, shipped, or stored without packaging or wrapping must be labeled or tagged directly on a visible exterior surface of the product as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Labels must be either printed directly on product packaging or in the form of a sticker or tag made of plastic, paper, metal, or other durable substances.
