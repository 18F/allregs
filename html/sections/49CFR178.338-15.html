                            <p class="depth0">A cargo tank constructed for oxygen service must be thoroughly cleaned to remove all foreign material in accordance with CGA G-4.1 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). All loose particles from fabrication, such as weld beads, dirt, grinding wheel debris, and other loose materials, must be removed prior to the final closure of the manhole of the tank. Chemical or solvent cleaning with a material compatible with the intending lading must be performed to remove any contaminants likely to react with the lading.
