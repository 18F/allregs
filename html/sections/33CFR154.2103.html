                            <p class="depth0">In this section, the requirements of having a flame arrester or a flame screen at the opening of a pressure relief valve or a vacuum relief valve apply only to facilities collecting vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A facility's vapor control system (VCS) must have the capacity for collecting cargo vapor at a rate of not less than the facility's maximum liquid transfer rate for cargoes that are vapor controlled plus the vapor growth for the cargoes and any inerting, diluting, or enriching gas that may be added to the system. Vapor growth must be considered as 25 percent of the cargo's saturated vapor pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) at 115 F, divided by 12.5 psia (the vapor pressure of gasoline at 115 F), times the facility's maximum liquid transfer rate, unless there is experimental data for actual vapor growth for turbulent transferring under the most severe conditions for vapor growth. If the cargo is transferred at temperatures above 115 F, the cargo's true vapor pressure (in psia) at the transferring temperature must be used when determining the vapor growth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A facility VCS must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 80 percent of the highest setting of any of the vessel's vacuum relief valves or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the vessel's pressure relief valves for a non-inerted tank vessel. A facility VCS also must be designed to prevent the pressure in a vessel's cargo tanks from going below 0.2 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or exceeding 80 percent of the lowest setting of any of the vessel's pressure relief valves for an inerted tank vessel. The system must sustain the pressure in the vessel's cargo tanks within this range at any cargo transfer rate less than or equal to the maximum transfer rate determined at the pre-transfer conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The pressure measured at the facility vapor connection must be corrected for pressure drops across the vessel's vapor collection system, vapor collection hose or arm, and vapor line up to the location of the pressure sensor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device that meets the installation requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, which activates an alarm that meets 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure at the facility vapor connection exceeds either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pressure corresponding to the upper pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A lower pressure agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a facility draws vapor from a vessel with a vapor-moving device, the facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, which activates an alarm meeting 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure at the facility vapor connection falls below either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pressure corresponding to the lower pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A higher pressure agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, independent of the device used to activate the alarm required by paragraph (d) of this section, meeting the installation requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, which activates the emergency shutdown system required by 33 CFR 154.550 when the pressure at the facility vapor connection exceeds the lower of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A pressure corresponding to 90 percent of the vessel's lowest pressure relief valve setting, corrected for pressure drops across the vessel's vapor collection system, the vapor collection hose or arm, and any vapor line up to the point where the pressure sensor is located;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A pressure corresponding to 90 percent of the setting of the pressure relief valve at the facility vapor connection, if the facility vapor connection is installed with a pressure relief valve; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A lower pressure than the pressure in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section that is agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a facility draws vapors from a vessel with a vapor-moving device, the facility vapor connection must have a pressure-sensing device, independent of the device used to activate the alarm required by paragraph (e) of this section, which closes the remotely operated cargo vapor shutoff valve required by 33 CFR 154.2101(a) when the vacuum at the facility vapor connection is more than the higher (lesser vacuum) of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A vacuum corresponding to 90 percent of the vessel's highest vacuum relief valve setting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A vacuum corresponding to 90 percent of the setting of the vacuum relief valve at the facility vapor connection, if the facility vapor connection is installed with a vacuum relief valve; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A lesser vacuum than the vacuum in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section that is agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The pressure-sensing devices required by paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section must be located in the vapor collection line between the facility vapor connection and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any isolation valve, unless an interlock is provided that prevents operation of the system when the isolation valve is closed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any components that could plug and cause a blockage in the vapor line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pressure-indicating device must be provided that displays the pressure in the vapor collection line between the facility vapor connection and any isolation valve or any devices which could cause a blockage in the vapor line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If a facility draws vapor from the vessel with a vapor-moving device capable of drawing more than 1 pound per square inch (psi) vacuum, a vacuum relief valve must be installed in the vapor collection line between the vapor-moving device and the facility vapor connection, which--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relieves at a predetermined pressure such that the pressure at the facility vapor connection is maintained at -1.0 psig (1.0 psig vacuum) or less vacuum;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has a relieving capacity equal to or greater than the capacity of the vapor-moving device;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has a flame arrester or flame screen fitted at the vacuum relief opening; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has been tested for relieving capacity in accordance with paragraph 1.5.1.3 of API 2000 (incorporated by reference, see 33 CFR 154.106) with a flame arrester or flame screen fitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> When a facility collects cargo vapor through an extensive length of vapor piping, such as an undersea pipeline from a vessel moored offshore, before reaching the first pressure sensor and vacuum relief valve, the vacuum relief valve may be set at a vacuum greater than 1 psi vacuum, provided the pressure controls take into account the pressure drop across the vessel's vapor collection system, any vapor collection hoses, and the vapor piping as a function of the actual transfer rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> If the pressure in the vapor collection system can exceed 1.5 psig during a malfunction of a pressure regulator

or control valve in an inerting, enriching, or diluting system, a pressure relief valve must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be located between where the inerting, enriching, or diluting gas is introduced into the vapor collection system and the facility vapor connection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Relieve at the higher of the following two pressures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pressure such that the pressure at the facility vapor connection does not exceed 1.5 psig; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lowest pressure relief valve setting of vessels that control vapors at the facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have a relieving capacity equal to or greater than the maximum capacity of the facility inerting, enriching, or diluting gas source flowing through the failed pressure regulator or control valve, taking into account the pressure drops across any flame arrester or discharge piping fitted at the relief valve's discharge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have a flame arrester or flame screen fitted at the discharge opening, if the design does not secure a minimum vapor discharge velocity of 30 meters (98.4 feet) per second; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Have been tested for relieving capacity in accordance with paragraph 1.5.1.3 of API 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The relieving capacity test required by paragraph (l)(5) of this section must be carried out with a flame screen fitted at the discharge opening if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The design of the pressure relief valve does not secure a minimum vapor discharge velocity of 30 meters (98.4 feet) per second; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The discharge is not fitted with a flame arrester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A facility that collects vapors emitted from vessel cargo tanks while inerting, padding, or purging cargo tanks must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide a pressure-sensing device that activates an alarm meeting 33 CFR 154.2100(e) when the pressure of the inerting, padding, or purging gas exceeds either the pressure corresponding to the higher pressure determined in paragraph (b) of this section or a lower pressure agreed upon at the pre-transfer conference;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide a pressure-sensing device, independent of the device required by paragraph (n)(1) of this section, which automatically stops the flow of inerting, padding, or purging gas to the vessel when the pressure of the inerting, padding, or purging gas exceeds 90 percent of the lowest setting of any pressure relief valve on the vessel; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Locate the pressure-sensing devices required by paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section in the inerting, padding, or purging gas piping downstream of any devices in the gas piping that could potentially isolate the vessel from the sensing devices.</p>
