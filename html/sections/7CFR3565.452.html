                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A decision to liquidate shall be made when it is determined that  the default cannot be cured through actions contained in Sec. 3565.403  or it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Agency  and the lender to liquidate. For interest accrual purposes, interest  will accrue for 90 calendar days after the date the liquidation plan is  approved by the Agency. If within 20 calendar days of the Agency's  receipt of the liquidation plan, the Agency fails to respond to the  lender's proposal or advise the lender to make revisions to the plan  that was submitted, the liquidation plan will be approved by default,  and the 90 calendar day period for interest accrual will commence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of a default involving a loan to an Indian tribe or  tribal corporation made under this section which is secured by an  interest in land within such tribe's reservation (as determined   by the Secretary of the Interior), including a community in Alaska  incorporated by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Indian  Reorganization Act (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.), the lender shall only pursue  liquidation after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal  member, the tribe, or the Indian housing authority serving the tribe. If  the lender subsequently proceeds to liquidate the account, the lender  shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the  property except to one of the entities described in the preceding  sentence.
