The letter also specifies the time and place of a public meeting for the presentation of arguments or sets a date by which written comments must be submitted. Submission of all information, whether at a public meeting or in written form, is normally scheduled about 30 days after the initial decision. The deadline for submission of information can be extended for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public notice of an initial decision is made in a Federal Register notice that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identifies the motor vehicle or item of equipment and its manufacturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Summarizes the information on which the decision is based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gives the location of all information available for public examination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> States the time and place of a public meeting or the deadline for written submission in which the manufacturer and interested persons may present information, views, and arguments respecting the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A transcript of the public meeting is kept and exhibits may be offered.
