                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Office shall use the point system described in this section  to determine the amount of the penalty and, in the case of notices of  violation, whether a mandatory penalty should be assessed as provided in  Sec. 723.12(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Points shall be assigned as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> History of previous violations. The Office shall assign up to 30  points based on the history of previous violations. One point shall be  assigned for each past violation contained in a notice of violations.  Five points shall be assigned for each violation (but not a condition or  practice) contained in a cessation order. The history of previous  violations for the purpose of assigning points, shall be determined and  the points assigned with respect to a particular surface coal mining  operation. Points shall be assigned as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A violation shall not be counted if the notice or order is the  subject of pending administrative or judicial review or if the time to  request such review or to appeal any administrative or judicial decision  has not expired, and thereafter it shall be counted for only one year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No violation for which the notice or order has been vacated  shall be counted; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each violation shall be counted without regard to whether it  led to a civil penalty assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seriousness. The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on  the seriousness of the violation, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Probability of occurrence. The Office shall assign up to 15  points based on the probability of the occurrence of the event which a  violated standard is designed to prevent. Points shall be assessed  according to the following schedule:</p><p class="depth0">Probability of Occurrence ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Points ------------------------------------------------------------------------ None...........................................................        0 Insignificant..................................................      1-4 Unlikely.......................................................      5-9 Likely.........................................................    10-14 Occurred.......................................................       15 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extent of potential or actual damage. The Office shall assign  up to 15 points, based on the extent of the potential or actual damage,  in terms of area and impact on the public or environment, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed  to prevent would remain within the permit area, the Office shall assign  zero to seven points, depending on the duration and extent of the damage  or impact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed  to prevent would extend outside the permit area, the Office shall assign  eight to fifteen points, depending on the duration and extent of the  damage or impact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative. In the case of a violation of an administrative  requirement, such as a requirement to keep records, the Office shall, in  lieu of paragraphs (i) and (ii), assign up to 15 points for seriousness,  based upon the extent to which enforcement is obstructed by the  violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Negligence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Office shall assign up to 25 points based on  the degree of fault of the person to whom the notice or order was issued  in causing or failing to correct the violation, condition, or practice  which led to the notice or order, either through act or omission. Points  shall be assessed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A violation which occurs through no negligence shall be assigned  no penalty points for negligence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A violation which is caused by negligence shall be assigned 12  points or less, depending on the degree of negligence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A violation which occurs through a greater degree of fault than  negligence shall be assigned 13 to 25 points, depending on the degree of  fault.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the degree of negligence involved in a violation  and the number of points to be assigned, the following definitions  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No negligence means an inadvertent violation which was  unavoidable by the exercise of reasonable care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Negligence means the failure of a permittee to prevent the  occurrence of any violation of his or her permit or any requirement of  the Act or this chapter due to indifference, lack of   diligence, or lack of reasonable care, or the failure to abate any  violation of such permit or the Act due to indifference, lack of  diligence, or lack of reasonable care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A greater degree of fault than negligence means reckless,  knowing, or intentional conduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In calculating points to be assigned for negligence, the acts  of all persons working on the surface coal mining and reclamation site  shall be attributed to the person to whom the notice or order was  issued, unless than person establishes that they were acts of deliberate  sabotage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Good faith in attemping to achieve compliance. (i) The Office  shall add points based on the degree of good faith of the person to whom  the notice or order was issued in attempting to achieve rapid compliance  after notification of the violation. Points shall be assigned as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">Degree of Good Faith ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Points ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Rapid compliance...........................................    -1 to -10 Normal compliance..........................................            0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following definitions shall apply under paragraph (b)(4)(i)  of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Rapid compliance means that the person to whom the notice or  order was issued took extraordinary measures to abate the violation in  the shortest possible time and that abatement was achieved before the  time set for abatement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Normal compliance means the person to whom the notice or order  was issued abated the violation within the time given for abatement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the consideration of this criterion is impractical because  of the length of the abatement period, the assessment may be made  without considering this criterion and may be reassessed after the  violation has been abated.</p>
