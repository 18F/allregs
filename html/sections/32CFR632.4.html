                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Deadly force is destructive physical force directed against a  person or persons (e.g., firing a lethal weapon). Use it only in extreme  need, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be used.  Use deadly force for one or more of the following reasons only:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In self-defense, when in imminent danger of death or serious  injury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To protect property related to national security, when  reasonably necessary to prevent--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Threatened theft, damage, or espionage aimed at property or  information specified by a commander or other competent authority as  vital to national security. (See paragraph (b) of this section.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Actual theft, damage, or espionage aimed at property or  information which, though not vital, is substantially important to  national security. (See paragraph (b) of this section.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Escape of an individual whose unauthorized presence near  property or information vital to national security is a reasonable  threat of theft, sabotage, or espionage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To prevent actual theft or sabotage of property (such as  operable weapons or ammunition) which could cause deadly harm to others  in the hands of an unauthorized person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To prevent serious offenses against a person or persons (e.g.,  armed robbery, rape, or violent destruction of property by arson,  bombing).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To apprehend a suspect believed to have committed any of the  types of offenses named in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To prevent the escape of a prisoner (when authorized by a  commander or other competent authority and reasonably necessary).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To obey lawful orders from higher authority governed by this  regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A commander or other competent authority will specify that  property or information is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vital to national security only when its loss, damage, or  compromise would seriously harm national security or an essential  national defense mission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantially important to national security based on the  mission and the material or information required to perform it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To comply with local law or international agreement or  arrangements, a   commander may impose further restrictions on using deadly force.  (Restrictions should not unduly compromise U.S. security interests).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Security criteria and standards for protection of nuclear  weapons (paragraph (c) of this section AR 50-5-1) and for chemical  agents (paragraph (c) of this section AR 50-6-1) also apply.</p>
