                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(D)</em> with respect to which  the requirements of section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to  section 355) are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A purchased a share of stock in Corporation X in 1935 for  $150. Since that date A has received distributions out of other than  earnings and profits (as defined in section 316) totaling $60, so that  A's adjusted basis for the stock is $90. In a transaction qualifying  under section 356, A exchanged this share for one share in Corporation  Y, worth $100, cash in the amount of $10, and other property with a fair  market value of $30. The exchange had the effect of the distribution of  a dividend. A's ratable share of the earnings and profits of Corporation  X accumulated after February 28, 1913, was $5. A realized a gain of $50  on the exchange, but the amount recognized is limited to $40, the sum of  the cash received and the fair market value of the other property. Of  the gain recognized, $5 is taxable as a dividend, and $35 is taxable as  a gain from the exchange of property. The basis to A of the one share of  stock of Corporation Y is $90, that is, the adjusted basis of the one  share of stock of Corporation X ($90), decreased by the sum of the cash  received ($10) and the fair market value of the other property received  ($30) and increased by the sum of the amount treated as a dividend ($5)  and the amount treated as a gain from the exchange of property ($35).  The basis of the other property received is $30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section applies to exchanges and distributions of stock and  securities occurring on or after January 23, 2006.
