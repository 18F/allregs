                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing  zones   shall be equipped with subsurface safety devices that will shut off the  flow from the well in the event of an emergency unless, after  application and justification, the well is determined by the District  Manager to be incapable of natural flowing. These devices may consist of  a surface-controlled subsurface safety valve (SSSV), a subsurface- controlled SSSV, an injection valve, a tubing plug, or a tubing/annular  subsurface safety device, and any associated safety valve lock or  landing nipple.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications for SSSVs. Surface-controlled and subsurface- controlled SSSVs and safety valve locks and landing nipples installed in  the OCS shall conform to the requirements in Sec.  250.806 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Surface-controlled SSSVs. All tubing installations open to a  hydrocarbon-bearing zone which is capable of natural flow shall be  equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV, except as specified in  paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section. The surface controls may  be located on the site or a remote location. Wells not previously  equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV and wells in which a surface- controlled SSSV has been replaced with a subsurface-controlled SSSV in  accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be equipped with  a surface-controlled SSSV when the tubing is first removed and  reinstalled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subsurface-controlled SSSVs. Wells may be equipped with  subsurface-controlled SSSVs in lieu of a surface-controlled SSSV  provided the lessee demonstrates to the District Manager's satisfaction  that one of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wells not previously equipped with surface-controlled SSSVs  shall be so equipped when the tubing is first removed and reinstalled,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells completed  from a single-well or multiwell satellite caisson or seafloor  completions, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells with a  surface-controlled SSSV that has become inoperable and cannot be  repaired without removal and reinstallation of the tubing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Design, installation, and operation of SSSVs. The SSSVs shall be  designed, installed, operated, and maintained to ensure reliable  operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The device shall be installed at a depth of 100 feet or more  below the seafloor within 2 days after production is established. When  warranted by conditions such as permafrost, unstable bottom conditions,  hydrate formation, or paraffins, an alternate setting depth of the  subsurface safety device may be approved by the District Manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Until a subsurface safety device is installed, the well shall be  attended in the immediate vicinity so that emergency actions may be  taken while the well is open to flow. During testing and inspection  procedures, the well shall not be left unattended while open to  production unless a properly operating subsurface-safety device has been  installed in the well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The well shall not be open to flow while the subsurface safety  device is removed, except when flowing of the well is necessary for a  particular operation such as cutting paraffin, bailing sand, or similar  operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All SSSVs must be inspected, installed, maintained, and tested  in accordance with American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice  14B, Recommended Practice for Design, Installation, Repair, and  Operation of Subsurface Safety Valve Systems (as specified in Sec.   250.198).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subsurface safety devices in shut-in wells. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New completions  (perforated but not placed on production) and completions shut in for a  period of 6 months shall be equipped with either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pump-through-type tubing plug;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A surface-controlled SSSV, provided the surface control has  been rendered inoperative; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An injection valve capable of preventing backflow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The setting depth of the subsurface safety device shall be  approved by the District Manager on a case-by-case basis, when warranted  by conditions such as permafrost, unstable bottom conditions, hydrate  formations, and paraffins.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Subsurface safety devices in injection wells. A surface- controlled SSSV or an injection valve capable of preventing backflow  shall be installed in all injection wells. This requirement is not  applicable if the District Manager   concurs that the well is incapable of flowing. The lessee shall verify  the no-flow condition of the well annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Temporary removal for routine operations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each wireline- or  pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device may be removed, without  further authorization or notice, for a routine operation which does not  require the approval of a Form BSEE-0124, Application for Permit to  Modify, in Sec.  250.601 of this part for a period not to exceed 15  days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The well shall be identified by a sign on the wellhead stating  that the subsurface safety device has been removed. The removal of the  subsurface safety device shall be noted in the records as required in  Sec.  250.804(b) of this part. If the master valve is open, a trained  person shall be in the immediate vicinity of the well to attend the well  so that emergency actions may be taken, if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A platform well shall be monitored, but a person need not remain  in the well-bay area continuously if the master valve is closed. If the  well is on a satellite structure, it must be attended or a pump-through  plug installed in the tubing at least 100 feet below the mud line and  the master valve closed, unless otherwise approved by the District  Manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The well shall not be allowed to flow while the subsurface  safety device is removed, except when flowing the well is necessary for  that particular operation. The provisions of this paragraph are not  applicable to the testing and inspection procedures in Sec.  250.804 of  this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Additional safety equipment. All tubing installations in which a  wireline- or pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device is installed  after the effective date of this subpart shall be equipped with a  landing nipple with flow couplings or other protective equipment above  and below to provide for the setting of the SSSV. The control system for  all surface-controlled SSSVs shall be an integral part of the platform  Emergency Shutdown System (ESD). In addition to the activation of the  ESD by manual action on the platform, the system may be activated by a  signal from a remote location. Surface-controlled SSSVs shall close in  response to shut-in signals from the ESD and in response to the fire  loop or other fire detection devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Emergency action. In the event of an emergency, such as an  impending storm, any well not equipped with a subsurface safety device  and which is capable of natural flow shall have the device properly  installed as soon as possible with due consideration being given to  personnel safety.</p>
