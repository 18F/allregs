                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to reporting excess personal property to GSA, reportable  personal property shall be screened for reutilization within DOE through  the Reportable Excess Automated Property System (REAPS) for a 30-day  period. REAPS also provides for a 15-day expedited screening period for  certain categories of personal property for economic development and to  satisfy urgent conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An additional 30-day screening period shall be allocated for  items eligible for screening by educational institutions through ERLE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Items in FSCG 66 (Instruments and Laboratory Equipment), 70  (General Purpose Information Processing Equipment (including firmware)),  and 99 (Miscellaneous) are reportable when the unit acquisition cost is  $1,000 or more.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In exceptional or unusual cases when time is critical, screening  of excess property may be accomplished by telegram or facsimile with due  consideration given to the additional costs involved. Examples of  situations when this method of screening would be used are when there is  a requirement for quick disposal actions due to unplanned contract  terminations or facilities closing; to alleviate the paying of storage  costs; when storage space is critical; to process exchange/sale  transactions; property dangerous to public health and safety; property  determined to be classified or otherwise sensitive for reasons of  national security (when classified communications facilities are used);  or for hazardous materials which may not be disposed of outside of the  Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Concurrent DOE and Federal agency screening generally shall not  be conducted.    Sec. 109-43.304-1.51  Transfers within DOE.</p><p class="depth2">Transfers within DOE generally shall be effected by completion of a  SF-122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property. Except for those  designated contractors authorized by the DOE contracting office to  execute transfer orders, transfers to DOE contractors must be approved  by the cognizant DOE property administrator for the contractor receiving  the property.</p>
