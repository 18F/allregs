This record shall be retained until all  necessary repairs are completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exception. A long-distance intercity passenger train that misses  a scheduled exterior calendar day mechanical inspection due to a delay  en route may continue in service to the location where the inspection  was scheduled to be performed. At that point, an exterior calendar day  mechanical inspection shall be performed prior to returning the  equipment to service. This flexibility applies only to the exterior  mechanical safety inspections required by this section, and does not  relieve the railroad of the responsibility to perform a calendar day  inspection on a unit classified as a ``locomotive'' under part 229 of  this chapter as required by Sec. 229.21 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records. A record shall be maintained of each exterior calendar  day mechanical inspection performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This record may be maintained in writing or electronically  provided FRA has access to the record upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The written or electronic record must contain the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identification number of the unit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The place, date, and time of the inspection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any non-complying conditions found; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The signature or electronic identification of the inspector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This record may be part of a single master report covering an  entire group of cars and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This record shall be maintained at the place where the  inspection is conducted or at one central location and shall be retained  for at least 92 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Cars requiring a single car test in accordance with Sec. 238.311  that are being moved in service to a location where the single car test  can be performed shall have the single car test completed prior to, or  as a part of, the exterior calendar day mechanical inspection.
