After the effective date of a  relevant standard, promulgated pursuant to section 112(d), (f), or (h)  of the Act, under this part, the preconstruction review requirements in  this section apply to the owner or operator of new affected sources and  reconstructed affected sources that are major-emitting as specified in  this section. New and reconstructed affected sources that commence  construction or reconstruction before the effective date of a relevant  standard are not subject to the preconstruction review requirements  specified in paragraphs (b)(3), (d), and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section includes notification requirements for new affected  sources and reconstructed affected sources that are not major-emitting  affected sources and that are or become subject to a relevant  promulgated emission standard after the effective date of a relevant  standard promulgated under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for existing, newly constructed, and reconstructed  sources. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A new affected source for which construction commences  after proposal of a relevant standard is subject to relevant standards  for new affected sources, including compliance dates. An affected source  for which reconstruction commences after proposal of a relevant standard  is subject to relevant standards for new sources, including compliance  dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of hazardous air  pollutants from that source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by  the Administrator under this part, no person may, without obtaining  written approval in advance from the Administrator in accordance with  the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, do  any of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Construct a new affected source that is major-emitting and  subject to such standard;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reconstruct an affected source that is major-emitting and  subject to such standard; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reconstruct a major source such that the source becomes an  affected source that is major-emitting and subject to the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by  the Administrator under this part, an owner or operator who constructs a  new affected source that is not major-emitting or reconstructs an  affected source that is not major-emitting that is subject to such  standard, or reconstructs a source such that the source becomes an  affected source subject to the standard, must notify the Administrator  of the intended construction or reconstruction. The notification must be  submitted in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 63.9(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After the effective date of any relevant standard promulgated by  the Administrator under this part, equipment added (or a process change)  to an affected source that is within the scope of the definition of  affected source under the relevant standard must be considered part of  the affected source and subject to all provisions of the relevant  standard established for that affected source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. The  provisions of this paragraph implement section 112(i)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General application requirements. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator who  is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section must  submit to the Administrator an application for approval of the  construction or reconstruction. The application must be submitted as  soon as practicable before actual construction or reconstruction begins.  The application for approval of construction or reconstruction may be  used to fulfill the initial notification requirements of  Sec. 63.9(b)(5). The owner or operator may submit the application for  approval well in advance of the date actual construction or  reconstruction begins in order to ensure a timely review by the  Administrator and that the planned date to begin will not be delayed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A separate application shall be submitted for each construction  or reconstruction. Each application for approval of construction or  reconstruction shall include at a minimum:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The applicant's name and address;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A notification of intention to construct a new major affected  source or make any physical or operational change to a major affected  source that may meet or has been determined to meet the criteria for a  reconstruction, as defined in Sec. 63.2 or in the relevant standard;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The address (i.e., physical location) or proposed address of the  source;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An identification of the relevant standard that is the basis of  the application;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The expected date of the beginning of actual construction or  reconstruction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The expected completion date of the construction or  reconstruction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> The type and quantity of hazardous air pollutants emitted by the  source, reported in units and averaging times and in accordance with the  test methods specified in the relevant standard, or if actual emissions  data are not yet available, an estimate of the type and quantity of  hazardous air pollutants expected to be emitted by the source reported  in units and averaging times specified in the relevant standard. The  owner or operator may submit percent reduction information if a relevant  standard is established in terms of percent reduction. However,  operating parameters, such as flow rate, shall be included in the  submission to the extent that they demonstrate performance and  compliance; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Other information as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An owner or operator who submits estimates or preliminary  information in place of the actual emissions data and analysis required  in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(H) and (d)(2) of this   section shall submit the actual, measured emissions data and other  correct information as soon as available but no later than with the  notification of compliance status required in Sec. 63.9(h) (see  Sec. 63.9(h)(5)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application for approval of construction. Each application for  approval of construction must include, in addition to the information  required in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, technical information  describing the proposed nature, size, design, operating design capacity,  and method of operation of the source, including an identification of  each type of emission point for each type of hazardous air pollutant  that is emitted (or could reasonably be anticipated to be emitted) and a  description of the planned air pollution control system (equipment or  method) for each emission point. The description of the equipment to be  used for the control of emissions must include each control device for  each hazardous air pollutant and the estimated control efficiency  (percent) for each control device.

The discussion shall be sufficiently  detailed to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the  technical or economic limitations affect the source's ability to comply  with the relevant standard and how they do so.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If in the application for approval of reconstruction the owner  or operator designates the affected source as a reconstructed source and  declares that there are no economic or technical limitations to prevent  the source from complying with all relevant standards or other  requirements, the owner or operator need not submit the information  required in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) through (d)(3)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional information.
