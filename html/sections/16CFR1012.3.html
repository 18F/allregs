                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commissioners and Agency employees are responsible for reporting  meeting arrangements for Agency meetings to the Office of the Secretary  so that they may be published in the Public Calendar or entered on the  Master Calendar at least seven days before a meeting, except as provided  in paragraph (d) of this section. These reports shall include the  following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Probable participants and their affiliations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date, time and place of the meeting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subject of the meeting (as fully and precisely described as  possible);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Who requested the meeting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the meeting involves matters of substantial interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notice that the meeting is open or reason why the meeting or any  portion of the meeting is closed (e.g., discussion of trade secrets);  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Names and telephone number of the CPSC host or CPSC contact  person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once a report has been made to the Office of the Secretary,  Agency employees subsequently desiring to attend the meeting need not  notify the Office of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When there is no opportunity to give seven days advance notice  of a meeting, Agency employees (other than the Commissioners or their  personal staff) who desire to hold or attend such a meeting must obtain  the approval of the General Counsel or his or her designee. Requests for  waiver of the seven-day advance notice requirement by members of the  staff who report to the Executive Director may only be submitted to the  General Counsel or his or her designee in writing by the Executive  Director or his or her designee. Personal staff of Commissioners must  obtain the approval of their respective Commissioners. If the short  notice is approved, the Agency employee must notify the Office of the  Secretary in advance of the meeting to record the meeting on the Master  Calendar. The Office of the Secretary shall publish notice of the  meeting as an addendum to the next Public Calendar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. The notice requirement shall not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meetings with outside parties not involving substantial interest  matters (although such meetings should be limited where the public  interest would be served);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meetings with outside parties held during the normal course of  surveillance, inspection, or investigation under any of the Acts  administered by the Commission, including informal citation hearings  under the Federal Hazardous Substance Act or the Poison Prevention  Packaging Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meetings with outside parties concerning the settlement or  negotiation of an individual case, including proposed remedial action,  or meetings concerning any administrative or judicial action in which  the outside party is a participant, party, or amicus curiae;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Routine speeches given by CPSC personnel before outside parties.  However, for information purposes, personnel are encouraged to submit  advance notice of these speeches to the Office of the Secretary for  inclusion in the Public Calendar;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Meetings with other Federal personnel that are also attended by  outside parties except where a specific matter to be discussed is also  pending before the Commission or its staff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Meetings with state, local or foreign government personnel  concerning intergovernmental cooperative efforts and not the advocacy of  a particular course of action on behalf of a constituency of the  governmental entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Meetings or discussions with or at the request of either members  of Congress and their staffs relating to legislation, appropriation or  oversight matters, or Management and Budget personnel relating to  legislation or appropriation matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Pre-proposal conferences involving confidential contracts made  pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(12) in connection with potential litigation  matters.</p>
