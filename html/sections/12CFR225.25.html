                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hearings--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedure to request hearing. Any request for a  hearing on a notice under this subpart shall comply with the provisions  of 12 CFR 262.3(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. The Board shall order a hearing only if there are disputed  issues of material fact that cannot be resolved in some other manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extension of period for hearing. The Board may extend the time  for action on any notice for such time as is reasonably necessary to  conduct a hearing and evaluate the hearing record. Such extension shall  not exceed 91 calendar days after the date of submission to the Board of  the complete record on the notice. The procedures for computation of the  91-day rule as set forth in Sec. 225.16(f) apply to notices under this  subpart that involve hearings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval through failure to act. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 225.24(d)(5), a notice under this  subpart shall be deemed to be approved at the conclusion of the period  that begins on the date the complete notice is received by the Reserve  Bank or the Board and that ends 60 calendar days plus any applicable  extension and tolling period thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete notice. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, a notice shall be deemed complete at such time as it contains  all information required by this subpart and all other information  requested by the Board or the Reserve Bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice to expand or alter nonbanking activities--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> De novo  expansion. A notice under this subpart is required to open a new office  or to form a subsidiary to engage in, or to relocate an existing office  engaged in, a nonbanking activity that the Board has previously approved  for the bank holding company under this regulation, only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Board's prior approval was limited geographically;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The activity is to be conducted in a country outside of the  United States and the bank holding company has not previously received  prior Board approval under this regulation to engage in the activity in  that country; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Board or appropriate Reserve Bank has notified the company  that a notice under this subpart is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activities outside United States. With respect to activities to  be engaged in outside the United States that require approval under this  subpart, the procedures of this section apply only to activities to be  engaged in directly by a bank holding company that is not a qualifying  foreign banking organization, or by a nonbank subsidiary of a bank  holding company approved under this subpart. Regulation K (12 CFR part  211) governs other international operations of bank holding companies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alteration of nonbanking activity. Unless otherwise permitted by  the Board, a notice under this subpart is required to alter a nonbanking  activity in any material respect from that considered by the Board in  acting on the application or notice to engage in the activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Emergency savings association acquisitions. In the case of a  notice to acquire a savings association, the Board may modify or  dispense with the public notice and hearing requirements of this subpart  if the Board finds that an emergency exists that requires the Board to  act immediately and the primary federal regulator of the institution  concurs.
