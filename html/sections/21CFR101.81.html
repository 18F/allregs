                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods and the risk of CHD. (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common and serious forms of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. High CHD rates occur among people with high total cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (6.21 (mmol/L)) or above and LDL-cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk total cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of CHD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system.

The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of CHD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Populations with a low incidence of CHD tend to have relatively low blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. These populations also tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products, such as whole oat products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of CHD. Other evidence demonstrates that the addition of soluble fiber from certain foods to a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol may also help to reduce the risk of CHD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Significance of the relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods and the risk of CHD. (1) CHD is a major public health concern in the United States. It accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for CHD is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of CHD. High blood total and LDL-cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CHD is a major public health concern in the United States.

High blood total and LDL-cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in the diets of many people in the United States. One of the major public health recommendations relative to CHD risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories

from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 milligrams (mg) or less per day. Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with lower blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels. Soluble fiber from certain foods, when included in a low saturated fat and cholesterol diet, also helps to lower blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirements.

Oat bran is produced by grinding clean oat groats or rolled oats and separating the resulting oat flour by suitable means into fractions such that the oat bran fraction is not more than 50 percent of the original starting material and provides at least 5.5 percent (dry weight basis (dwb)) [beta]-glucan soluble fiber and a total dietary fiber content of 16 percent (dwb), and such that at least one-third of the total dietary fiber is soluble fiber;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rolled oats. Rolled oats, also known as oatmeal, produced from 100 percent dehulled, clean oat groats by steaming, cutting, rolling, and flaking, and provides at least 4 percent (dwb) of

[beta]-glucan soluble fiber and a total dietary fiber content of at least 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whole oat flour. Whole oat flour is produced from 100 percent dehulled, clean oat groats by steaming and grinding, such that there is no significant loss of oat bran in the final product, and provides at least 4 percent (dwb) of [beta]-glucan soluble fiber and a total dietary fiber content of at least 10 percent (dwb).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Oatrim. The soluble fraction of alpha-amylase hydrolyzed oat bran or whole oat flour, also known as oatrim. Oatrim is produced from either oat bran as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section or whole oat flour as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(3) of this section by solubilization of the starch in the starting material with an alpha-amylase hydrolysis process, and then removal by centrifugation of the insoluble components consisting of a high portion of protein, lipid, insoluble dietary fiber, and the majority of the flavor and color components of the starting material. Oatrim shall have a beta-glucan soluble fiber content up to 10 percent (dwb) and not less than that of the starting material (dwb).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whole grain barley and dry milled barley. Dehulled and hull-less whole grain barley with a [beta]-glucan soluble fiber content of at least 4 percent (dwb) and a total dietary fiber content of at least 10 percent (dwb). Dry milled barley grain products include barley bran, barley flakes, barley grits, pearl barley, barley flour, barley meal, and sieved barley meal that are produced from clean, sound dehulled or hull-less barley grain using standard dry milling techniques, which may include steaming or tempering, and that contain at least 4 percent (dwb) of [beta]-glucan soluble fiber and at least 8 percent (dwb) of total dietary fiber, except barley bran and sieved barley meal for which the minimum [beta]-glucan soluble fiber content is 5.5 percent (dwb) and minimum total dietary fiber content is 15 percent (dwb). Dehulled barley, hull-less barley, barley bran, barley flakes, barley grits, pearl barley, and barley flour are as defined in the Barley Glossary (AACC Method 55-99), published in Approved Methods of the American Association of Cereal Chemists, 10th ed. (2000), pp. 1 and 2, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Barley meal is unsifted, ground barley grain not subjected to any processing to separate the bran, germ, and endosperm. Sieved barley meal is an endosperm cell wall-enriched fraction of ground barley separated from meal by sieving or by air classification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Barley betafiber. Barley betafiber is the ethanol precipitated soluble fraction of cellulase and alpha-amylase hydrolyzed whole grain barley. Barley betafiber is produced by hydrolysis of whole grain barley flour, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(5) of this section, with a cellulase and alpha-amylase enzyme preparation, to produce a clear aqueous extract that contains mainly partially hydrolyzed beta-glucan and substantially hydrolyzed starch. The soluble, partially hydrolyzed beta-glucan is separated from the insoluble material by centrifugation, and after removal of the insoluble material, the partially hydrolyzed beta-glucan soluble fiber is separated from the other soluble compounds by precipitation with ethanol. The product is then dried, milled and sifted. Barley betafiber shall have a beta-glucan soluble fiber content of at least 70 percent on a dry weight basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> Psyllium husk from the dried seed coat (epidermis) of the seed of Plantago (P.) ovata, known as blond psyllium or Indian psyllium, P. indica, or P. psyllium.
