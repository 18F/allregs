                            <p class="depth0">An open video system operator may be subject to the payment of fees  on the gross revenues of the operator for the provision of cable service  imposed by a local franchising authority or other governmental entity,  in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under Section 622 of the  Communications Act. Local governments shall have the authority to assess  and receive the gross revenue fee. Gross revenues under this paragraph  means all gross revenues received by an open video system operator or  its affiliates, including all revenues received from subscribers and all  carriage revenues received from unaffiliated video programming  providers. In addition gross revenues under this paragraph includes any  advertising revenues received by an open video system operator or its  affiliates in connection with the provision of video programming, where  such revenues are included in the calculation of the incumbent cable  operator's cable franchise fee. Gross revenues does not include revenues  collected by unaffiliated video programming providers, such as  subscriber or advertising revenues. Any gross revenues fee that the open  video system operator or its affiliate collects from subscribers or  video programming providers shall be excluded from gross revenues. An  operator of an open video system or any programming provider may  designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the fee as  a separate item on the bill. An operator of an open video system may  recover the gross revenue fee from programming providers on a  proportional basis as an element of the carriage rate.  [61 FR 43177, Aug. 21, 1996]</p>
