                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> (that is, a mutual savings bank not having capital stock  represented by shares, a domestic building and loan association, or a  cooperative bank without capital stock organized and operated for mutual  purposes and without profit), no gain or loss shall be recognized, and  no debt shall be considered as becoming worthless or partially worthless  for purposes of section 166 (relating to bad debts), as the result of a  transaction by which such creditor bids in at foreclosure, or reduces to  ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, any property  (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible) which was security  for the payment of any indebtedness (whether or not a qualifying real  property loan as defined in section 593(e)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1))</em>. The treatment provided  by section 595(a) is mandatory (regardless of whether such creditor  utilizes the specific deduction or reserve method of accounting for bad  debts) if, for the taxable year in which the property is bid in at  foreclosure, or reduced to ownership or possession by agreement or  process of law, the creditor is an organization described in section  593(a), even though the creditor subsequently becomes an organization  not described in section 593(a). For definition of the terms domestic  building and loan association and cooperative bank for taxable years  beginning after October 16, 1962, see paragraphs (19) and (32),  respectively, of section 7701(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective date. Section 595 applies to any transaction  (described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) occurring after  December 31, 1962, except that such section does not apply to any such  transaction in which the taxable event determined without regard to   section 595 (that is, the sale or exchange to the creditor of the  security property by reason of the default or anticipated default of the  debtor) occurred before January 1, 1963.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules for determining when security property is reduced to  ownership or possession by agreement or process of law--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ownership or  possession. For purposes of this section, security property shall be  considered as reduced to ownership or possession by agreement or process  of law on the earliest date on which the creditor, by reason of the  default or anticipated default of the debtor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acquires, by agreement or process of law, a title to, or a right  or interest in, the security property which under local law is  indefeasible and which the creditor can validly dispose of apart from  the indebtedness which the property secures, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Acquires, by agreement or process of law, an enforceable right  to direct the use to which the security property shall be put,  including, in the case of real property, whether or not the property  shall continue to be occupied by the debtor who has defaulted  (regardless of whether such creditor has obtained indefeasible title to  the property), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sells or otherwise disposes of the security property or any  interest therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Agreement or process of law. The reduction of security property  to ownership or possession by agreement includes, where valid under  local law, such methods as voluntary conveyance from the debtor  (including a conveyance directly to the Federal Housing Commissioner)  and abandonment to the creditor. The reduction of security property to  ownership or possession by process of law includes foreclosure  proceedings in which a competitive bid is entered, such as foreclosure  by judicial sale or by power of sale contained in the loan agreement  without recourse to the courts, as well as those types of foreclosure  proceedings in which a competitive bid is not entered, such as strict  foreclosure and foreclosure by entry and possession, by writ of entry,  or by publication or notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 31, 1963, X, a creditor which is an  organization described in section 593(a), purchases at a foreclosure  sale residential real property which was security for a debt owing to X,  and with respect to which the debtor has defaulted. Under local law,  there is a 1-year statutory redemption period (during which period the  debtor is entitled to remain in possession) so that X must wait until  February 1, 1964, to obtain indefeasible title to the property. No gain  or loss is recognized by reason of the purchase at the foreclosure sale  on January 31, 1963. However, the date on which the security property is  considered as reduced to ownership or possession by agreement or process  of law is February 1, 1964. If, under local law, there were no statutory  redemption period so that X obtained indefeasible title to the security  property at the foreclosure sale, the date on which the security  property would be considered as so reduced is January 31, 1963.  Furthermore, with respect to either of the preceding situations, if the  foreclosure sale had occurred on November 1, 1962 (instead of on January  31, 1963), section 595 would not apply to the transaction since the  taxable event in respect of such transaction occurred prior to January  1, 1963.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that  instead of purchasing the property at a foreclosure sale, X, pursuant to  the provisions of local law, enters upon the security property on  January 31, 1963, and acquires an enforceable right to direct whether  the property shall continue to be occupied by the debtor. X does not  obtain indefeasible title to the property until February 1, 1964. The  date on which the security property is considered as reduced to  ownership or possession by agreement or process of law is January 31,  1963.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Basis of acquired property. Section 595(c) provides that the  basis of any property to which section 595(a) applies (hereinafter  referred to as acquired property) shall be the adjusted basis of the  indebtedness for which such property was security, determined as of the  date of acquisition of such property, properly increased for costs of  acquisition. The date of acquisition is the date, determined under  paragraph (b) of this section, on which the security property is reduced  to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law. Costs of  acquisition are expenditures incurred by the creditor (for example, fees  for an attorney, master, trustee, auctioneer, for publication, acquiring  title, clearing liens, filing and   recording, and court costs) which are directly related to the  foreclosure sale or proceeding, or to the other process used to reduce  the security property to ownership or possession, or both, by agreement  or process of law. For purposes of determining the adjusted basis of the  indebtedness for which the acquired property was security, there shall  be included the amount of any unpaid interest with respect to such  indebtedness, but only to the extent that it has been included in gross  income. The basis of the acquired property, as determined under this  paragraph, shall be adjusted in accordance with the rules provided in  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Characteristics of acquired property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Depreciation; decline  in fair market value. Section 595(b) provides, in part, that for  purposes of section 166 (relating to bad debts) acquired property shall  be considered as property having the same characteristics as the  indebtedness for which such property was security. Thus, no deduction  for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, or depletion  shall be allowed to a creditor with respect to acquired property.  However, if, at any time, the adjusted basis of the acquired property  exceeds the fair market value of such property (determined by proper  appraisal and without regard to any outstanding right of redemption),  and the creditor can establish (in the same manner as worthlessness in  whole or in part is established for purposes of section 166) that an  amount equal to any portion of such excess will not be collected with  respect to the indebtedness for which such property was security, the  creditor may treat such portion, under the provisions of section 166, as  a worthless debt. In such case, the basis of the acquired property shall  be reduced by the amount treated as a worthless debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X Corporation, a creditor which is an organization  described in section 593(a), makes its returns on the basis of the  calendar year and the reserve method of accounting for bad debts. In  1963, A defaults in his payments on a debt owed to X which is secured by  residential real property. X reduces the property to ownership or  possession by agreement or process of law by bidding it in at a  foreclosure sale for $23,000. The adjusted basis of the indebtedness at  the date of acquisition of the property (increased for costs of  acquisition) is $25,000, and this amount becomes the basis of the  acquired property. X obtains a deficiency judgment against A for $2,000.  Later in 1963, a proper appraisal enables X to establish that the fair  market value of the property is $18,000. X is also able to establish  (under the rules of section 166 and the regulations thereunder) that due  to A's poor financial condition only $1,000 can be collected on the  outstanding deficiency judgment. For the year 1963, X may charge its bad  debt reserve for $6,000, computed as follows:  Basis of acquired property...................................    $25,000 Less: Fair market value of acquired property.................     18,000</p><p class="depth0">---------- Excess.......................................................      7,000 Less: Collectible portion of deficiency judgment.............      1,000</p><p class="depth0">---------- Portion of excess treated as worthless debt..................      6,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Capital improvements made after date of acquisition not treated  as acquired property. Except as provided in subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph, the term acquired property does not include capital  improvements made after the date of (acquisition within the meaning of  paragraph (d) of this section) of the property. Thus, the applicable  deduction for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, or  depletion shall be allowed, if otherwise allowable, for improvements  which are made by the creditor with respect to acquired property and  which are properly chargeable to the capital account. If the creditor  sells or otherwise disposes of the acquired property with such capital  improvements, any amount realized by reason of such sale or other  disposition shall be allocated in proportion to the respective fair  market values of the acquired property and such capital improvements.  The portion of the amount realized which is allocable to the acquired  property shall be treated in accordance with the rules prescribed in  subparagraph (6) of this paragraph. The portion of the amount realized  which is allocable to such capital improvements shall be treated under  the applicable rules governing the sale or other disposition of such  property and without regard to section 595.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of minor capital improvements as acquired property. A  creditor   may treat any minor capital improvements which it makes to a particular  acquired property after the date of acquisition (within the meaning of  paragraph (d) of this section) in the same manner as the acquired  property, provided such creditor treats all minor capital improvements  with respect to that particular acquired property in such manner. For  purposes of section 595, a capital improvement shall be considered as  minor only if the cost of such improvement does not exceed $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records for capital improvements. For purposes of subparagraphs  (3) and (4) of this paragraph, the creditor must maintain such records  as are necessary to clearly reflect, with respect to each particular  acquired property, the cost of each capital improvement and whether the  taxpayer treated minor capital improvements with respect to such  property in the same manner as the acquired property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Amounts realized with respect to acquired property. Section  595(b) provides, in part, that any amount realized with respect to  acquired property shall be treated as a payment on account of the  indebtedness for which such property was security, and any loss with  respect thereto shall be treated as a bad debt to which the provisions  of section 166 (relating to bad debts) apply. An amount realized with  respect to acquired property means an amount representing a recovery of  capital, such as proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the  property, payments on the original indebtedness made by or on behalf of  the debtor (including amounts received under an insurance contract with  the Federal Housing Administration or a guarantee by the Veterans'  Administration), and collections on a deficiency judgment obtained  against the debtor (other than amounts treated as interest under  applicable local law). Amounts realized with respect to acquired  property include amounts which otherwise would be treated in the manner  prescribed in section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation  controlled by transferor), section 354 (relating to exchanges of stock  and securities in certain reorganizations), section 453 (relating to  installment method), section 1031 (relating to exchange of property held  for productive use or for investment), or section 1033 (relating to  involuntary conversions). For purposes of section 595(b), if a  corporation distributes acquired property in a distribution to which  section 311 (relating to taxability of corporation on distribution) or  section 336 (relating to nonrecognition of gain or loss to a corporation  on distribution of its property in partial or complete liquidation)  applies, the fair market value of the acquired property at the time of  the distribution shall be treated as an amount realized with respect to  such property. However, no amount shall be considered realized by reason  of the distribution or transfer of acquired property in a transaction to  which section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate  acquisitions) applies, and in the case of such a distribution or  transfer the acquired property shall be treated by the distributee or  transferee as having the same characteristics as it had in the hands of  the distributor or transferor at the time of such distribution or  transfer. The following rules shall apply to amounts realized with  respect to acquired property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any amount realized shall be applied against and reduce the  adjusted basis of the acquired property, and to the extent that such  amount exceeds the adjusted basis, it shall, in the case of a creditor  using the specific deduction method of accounting for bad debts, be  included in gross income as ordinary income, or, in the case of a  creditor using the reserve method of accounting for bad debts, be  credited to the appropriate bad debt reserve (that is, the reserve for  losses on qualifying real property loans or the reserve for losses on  nonqualifying loans). Any amounts credited during the taxable year to a  reserve for bad debts pursuant to this subdivision shall not be  considered as a part of the addition under section 593 for such year,  but shall be included in the balance of the reserve for purposes of  computing such addition to the reserve for such taxable year. Thus, for  example, an amount credited to the reserve for losses on qualifying real  property loans during a taxable year shall not be considered as a part  of the addition to such reserve   computed under the percentage of taxable income method. However, the  amount of such credit shall be included in the balance of such reserve  for the purpose of determining the amount necessary to increase the  balance of such reserve (as of the close of such taxable year) to an  amount equal to 3 percent of qualifying real property loans and for the  purpose of determining whether such balance exceeds 6 percent of such  loans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an amount realized on the sale or other disposition of the  acquired property is insufficient to restore to the creditor the  adjusted basis of the property, the difference between such adjusted  basis and such amount realized shall be treated as a bad debt to which  the provisions of section 166 apply. If the creditor subsequently  realizes an additional amount with respect to the original indebtedness  or the acquired property, such additional amount shall be treated as the  recovery of a bad debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Treatment of rents, similar amounts, and expenses. Section 595  does not change the treatment of rents, royalties, dividends, interest,  or similar amounts received or accrued by the creditor with respect to  acquired property, nor does it change the treatment of expenses incurred  with respect to such property. (See, however, subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph for treatment of depreciation, etc.) Thus, for example, if the  acquired property is a governmental obligation within the meaning of  section 103 (relating to interest on certain governmental obligations),  interest payments received by the creditor with respect to such  obligation would not be included in gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The provisions of subparagraphs (6) and (7) of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X Corporation, a creditor which is an  organization described in section 593(a), uses the reserve method of  accounting for bad debts. On May 1, 1964, X reduces to ownership or  possession by agreement or process of law improved real property which  is security for an indebtedness of A which is in default. On the date of  acquisition there remains unpaid on the indebtedness $20,000 principal  and $700 interest. X has previously included the $700 interest in gross  income. Subsequent to acquisition, X incurs expenses totaling $500 for  maintenance, and during the period June 1 through September 30, 1964,  rents the property for a total rental of $400. Under local law, X is  accountable to A for the rents received and A is accountable to X for  the expenses incurred. There are no other receipts or expenses until  October 1, 1964, at which time X sells the acquired property for  $22,000. Under local law, A is not entitled to any portion of the sales  proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of rents, expenses, and sales proceeds. X would treat  rents, expenses, and sales proceeds in the following manner:  Basis of acquired property at acquisition (adjusted basis of     $20,700</p><p class="depth0">indebtedness, i.e., $20,000 principal plus $700 interest)... Plus: Expenses charged to debtor.............................        500</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">21,200 Less: Rents credited to debtor...............................        400</p><p class="depth0">---------- Adjusted basis of acquired property at sale..................     20,800 Less: Portion of $22,000 sales proceeds applied in reduction      20,800</p><p class="depth0">of adjusted basis of acquired property......................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">0</p><p class="depth0">========== Portion of sales proceeds credited to reserve for losses on        1,200</p><p class="depth0">qualifying real property loans ($22,000 minus $20,800)......</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Creditor using specific deduction method. If instead of using  the reserve method of accounting for bad debts X used the specific  deduction method, the $1,200 portion of the sales proceeds would be  treated as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in example 1 except  that under local law X is not accountable to A for any portion of the  rents received and A is not accountable to X for the expenses incurred  by X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of rents and expenses. X includes in gross income the  total rent receipts of $400 and deducts (if otherwise allowable) the  expenses of $500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of sales proceeds. As the result of the sale of the  acquired property, X credits $1,300 to the reserve for losses on  qualifying real property loans, computed as follows:  Basis of acquired property at acquisition and at date of sale    $20,700</p><p class="depth0">(adjusted basis of indebtedness, i.e., $20,000 principal</p><p class="depth0">plus $700 interest).........................................

If instead of using  the reserve method of accounting for bad debts X used the specific  deduction method, the $1,300 portion of the   sales proceeds would be treated as ordinary income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same in example 1 except  that X sells the acquired property for $15,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of rents, expenses, and sales proceeds. X would treat  rents, expenses, and sales proceeds in the following manner:  Basis of acquired property at acquisition (adjusted basis of     $20,700</p><p class="depth0">indebtedness, i.e., $20,000 principal plus $700 interest)... Plus: Expenses charged to debtor.............................        500</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">21,200 Less: Rents credited to debtor...............................        400 Adjusted basis of acquired property at sale..................     20,800 Less: Portion of $15,000 sales proceeds applied in reduction      15,000</p><p class="depth0">of adjusted basis of acquired property......................</p><p class="depth0">---------- Amount charged to reserve for losses on qualifying real            5,800</p><p class="depth0">property loans..............................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Creditor using specific deduction method. If instead of using  the reserve method of accounting for bad debts X used the specific  deduction method, the excess of $5,800 would be allowed as a specific  bad debt deduction.
