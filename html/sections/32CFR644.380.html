                                Sec. 644.380  Restoration of lands made available by other Government agencies.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement. Where the Department retransfers real property, the  use of which has been obtained from other Federal agencies (including  withdrawals from the public domain recommended for return to the public  domain) by means of use permits, public land orders, or other methods,  the property should be restored to a condition as good as that which  existed at the time the department took possession, damages by the  elements or by circumstances over which the Department has no control  excepted, unless the agency from which the property was obtained  expressly waives restoration. Restoration of public domain land will not  be initiated until the determination is made that the land is suitable  for return to the public domain. Public domain land that is to be  reported excess to GSA will not be restored. The procedure enunciated in  Sec. Sec. 644.516 through 644.539 relative to neutralization of  unexploded bombs or artillery projectiles located on leased premises  applies with equal force to Government-owned lands returned to other  Federal agencies and to public domain land that is to be reported as  excess for disposal by GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority. The report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on  the DOD Appropriation Bill, 1966 (Senate Report 625, 89th Congress,  dated 18 August 1965), contained the following language:</p><p class="depth2">Such funds as may be required may be used to restore lands under  jurisdiction of other Government agencies, damaged while being used for  military training purposes under agreement with such agencies.   The Comptroller General considers the foregoing to be a clear expression  of Congressional intent, and that authority exists for the Department of  the Army to restore (or make payment in   lieu thereof) lands of other Federal agencies which have been damaged by  the Army while being used under agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of restoration costs. ENG Form 1440-R, Cost of  Restoration, appropriately modified, will be used for the preparation of  an estimate of cost of restoration, or salvage or market value, for the  purpose of determining the cost of restoration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payments for, or in lieu of restoration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Work performed by  the Department of the Army. If the work is performed by the Department,  payment will be made from funds available to the office performing the  work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Work performed by controlling agency. If the work has been  performed by the agency having administrative control over the property,  pursuant to agreement with the Department, reimbursement to that agency  may be made by properly supported SF 1080, Voucher for Transfer Between  Appropriations and/or Funds, from funds available to the DE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment in lieu of restoration. If the work has not been  performed by either agency and a payment is desired in lieu of  restoration, the payment is, in effect, an advance of funds. As such,  the advance of funds will be accomplished in OCE, based on submission by  the controlling agency of SF 1080 properly supported.</p>
