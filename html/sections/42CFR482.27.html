Potentially HCV infectious blood and blood components are the blood and blood components identified in 21 CFR 610.47.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Services furnished by an outside blood collecting establishment. If a hospital regularly uses the services of an outside blood collecting establishment, it must have an agreement with the blood collecting establishment that governs the procurement, transfer, and availability of blood and blood components. The agreement must require that the blood collecting establishment notify the hospital--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 3 calendar days if the blood collecting establishment supplied blood and blood components collected from a donor who tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for evidence of HIV or HCV infection on a later donation or who is determined to be at increased risk for transmitting HIV or HCV infection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within 45 days of the test, of the results of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test for HIV or HCV, as relevant, or other follow-up testing required by FDA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Within 3 calendar days after the blood collecting establishment supplied blood and blood components collected from an infectious donor, whenever records are available, as set forth at 21 CFR 610.48(b)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quarantine and disposition of blood and blood components pending completion of testing. If the blood collecting establishment (either internal or under an agreement) notifies the hospital of the reactive HIV or HCV screening test results, the hospital must determine the disposition of the blood or blood product and quarantine all blood and blood components from previous donations in inventory.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental (additional, more specific) test or other follow-up testing required by FDA is negative, absent other informative test results, the hospital may release the blood and blood components from quarantine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental, (additional, more specific) test or other follow-up testing required by FDA is positive, the hospital must--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Dispose of the blood and blood components; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Notify the transfusion beneficiaries as set forth in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that the result of the supplemental, (additional, more specific) test or other follow-up testing required by FDA is indeterminate, the hospital must destroy or label prior collections of blood or blood components held in quarantine as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46(b)(2), 610.47(b)(2), and 610.48(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Recordkeeping by the hospital.

For notifications resulting from donors tested on or after February 20, 2008 as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46 and 21 CFR 610.47 the notification effort begins when the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that it received potentially HIV or HCV infectious blood and blood components. The hospital must make reasonable attempts to give notification over a period of 12 weeks unless--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The patient is located and notified; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The hospital is unable to locate the patient and documents in the patient's medical record the extenuating circumstances beyond the hospital's control that caused the notification timeframe to exceed 12 weeks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For donors tested before February 20, 2008. For notifications resulting from donors tested before February 20, 2008 as set forth at 21 CFR 610.48(b) and (c), the notification effort begins when the blood collecting establishment notifies the hospital that it received potentially HCV infectious blood and blood components. The hospital must make reasonable attempts to give notification and must complete the actions within 1 year of the date on which the hospital received notification from the outside blood collecting establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Content of notification. The notification must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A basic explanation of the need for HIV or HCV testing and counseling;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Enough oral or written information so that an informed decision can be made about whether to obtain HIV or HCV testing and counseling; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A list of programs or places where the person can obtain HIV or HCV testing and counseling, including

any requirements or restrictions the program may impose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Policies and procedures. The hospital must establish policies and procedures for notification and documentation that conform to Federal, State, and local laws, including requirements for the confidentiality of medical records and other patient information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Notification to legal representative or relative. If the patient has been adjudged incompetent by a State court, the physician or hospital must notify a legal representative designated in accordance with State law. If the patient is competent, but State law permits a legal representative or relative to receive the information on the patient's behalf, the physician or hospital must notify the patient or his or her legal representative or relative. For possible HIV infectious transfusion beneficiaries that are deceased, the physician or hospital must inform the deceased patient's legal representative or relative. If the patient is a minor, the parents or legal guardian must be notified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Applicability. HCV notification requirements resulting from donors tested before February 20, 2008 as set forth at 21 CFR 610.48 will expire on August 24, 2015.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General blood safety issues. For lookback activities only related to new blood safety issues that are identified after August 24, 2007, hospitals must comply with FDA regulations as they pertain to blood safety issues in the following areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate testing and quarantining of infectious blood and blood components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification and counseling of beneficiaries that may have received infectious blood and blood components.
