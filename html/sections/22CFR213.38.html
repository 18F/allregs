                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> USAID's procedures call for transfer of legally enforceable debt to FMS 90 days after the Bill for Collection or

demand letter is issued. A debt is legally enforceable if there has been a final agency determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due and there are no legal bars to collection action. A debt is not considered legally enforceable for purposes of mandatory transfer to FMS if a debt is the subject of a pending administrative review process required by statute or regulation and collection action during the review process is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, USAID will transfer any debt covered by this part that is more than 180 days delinquent to FMS for debt collection services. A debt is considered 180 days delinquent for purposes of this section if it is 180 days past due and is legally enforceable.</p>
