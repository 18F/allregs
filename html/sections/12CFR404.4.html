                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form. Requests must be made in writing and must be signed by, or on behalf of, the requester. Requests should be addressed to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Office at the address in Sec. 404.1(f) and should contain both the return address and telephone number of the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of records requested. Each request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail so as to enable a professional employee of Ex-Im Bank familiar with the subject matter of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. A request shall not be deemed to have been received until such time as the request adequately identifies the records sought. To the extent practicable, a description should include relevant dates, format, subject matter, and the name of any person to whom the record is known to relate. A general request for records with no accompanying date restriction, either express or implied, shall be deemed to be a request for records created within the preceding twelve months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fee statement. The request must contain a statement expressing willingness to pay fees for the requested records or a request for a fee waiver (see Sec. 404.10) before the request shall be deemed to have been received. A fee statement may specify the maximum amount a requester is willing to pay for processing the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever a requester submits a FOIA request that does not contain a fee statement or a request for a fee waiver, Ex-Im Bank shall advise the requester of the requirements of this paragraph. If the requester fails to respond within ten working days of such notification, then the Freedom of Information and Privacy Office shall notify the requester, in writing, that Ex-Im Bank will not process the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A general statement by the requester expressing willingness to pay all applicable fees under Sec. 404.9 shall be deemed an agreement to pay up to $50.00. If Ex-Im Bank estimates that the fees for a request will exceed $50.00, then Ex-Im Bank shall offer the requester the opportunity to agree, in writing, either to pay a greater fee or to modify the request as a means of limiting the cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Written notice of amendment. The requester should provide any amendment to the original request in writing to Ex-Im Bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requester assistance. Ex-Im Bank shall make reasonable efforts to assist a requester in complying with the requirements of this section.</p>
