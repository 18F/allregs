                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Identify potentially permanent records. Useful  guidelines in the identification of permanent Federal records may be  found in the NARA records management handbook, Disposition of Federal  Records (see Sec. 1225.12 for the Web site address of this  publication).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. Each item proposed for permanent retention on an  SF 115 must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Descriptive title of the records series, component of an  information system, or appropriate aggregation of series and/or  information system components. The descriptive title must be meaningful  to agency personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete description of the records including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Agency function;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Physical type, if appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inclusive dates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Statement of how records are arranged;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Statement of restrictions on access under the FOIA if the  records are proposed for immediate transfer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disposition instructions developed using the following  guidelines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the records series or system is current and continuing, the  SF 115 must specify the period of time after which the records will be  transferred to the National Archives of the United States, and if  appropriate, the time period for returning inactive records to an  approved records storage facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the records series or system is nonrecurring, i.e., no  additional records will be created or acquired, the agency must propose  either that the records be transferred to the National Archives of the  United States immediately or set transfer for a fixed date in the  future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination. NARA will appraise the records to determine if  they have sufficient value to warrant archival permanent preservation.  If NARA determines either that records are not permanent or that the  transfer instructions are not appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NARA will notify the agency and negotiate an appropriate  disposition. The disposition instruction on the SF 115 will be modified  prior to NARA approval; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If NARA and the agency cannot agree on the disposition  instruction for an item(s), the items(s) will be withdrawn. In these  cases, the agency must submit an SF 115 with a revised proposal for  disposition; unscheduled records must be treated as permanent until a  new schedule is approved.</p>
