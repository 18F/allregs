                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A telecommunications carrier may use a written or electronically  signed letter of agency to obtain authorization and/or verification of a  subscriber's request to change his or her preferred carrier selection. A  letter of agency that does not conform with this section is invalid for  purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The letter of agency shall be a separate document (or an easily  separable document) or located on a separate screen or webpage  containing only the authorizing language described in paragraph (e) of  this section having the sole purpose of authorizing a telecommunications  carrier to initiate a preferred carrier change. The letter of agency  must be signed and dated by the subscriber to the telephone line(s)  requesting the preferred carrier change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The letter of agency shall not be combined on the same document,  screen, or webpage with inducements of any kind.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the  letter of agency may be combined with checks that contain only the  required letter of agency language as prescribed in paragraph (e) of  this section and the necessary information to make the check a  negotiable instrument. The letter of agency check shall not contain any  promotional language or material. The letter of agency check shall  contain in easily readable, bold-face type on the front of the check, a  notice that the subscriber is authorizing a preferred carrier change by  signing the check. The letter of agency language shall be placed near  the signature line on the back of the check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At a minimum, the letter of agency must be printed with a type  of sufficient size and readable type to be clearly legible and must  contain clear and unambiguous language that confirms:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The subscriber's billing name and address and each telephone  number to be covered by the preferred carrier change order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decision to change the preferred carrier from the current  telecommunications carrier to the soliciting telecommunications carrier;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the subscriber designates [insert the name of the  submitting carrier] to act as the subscriber's agent for the preferred  carrier change;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the subscriber understands that only one telecommunications  carrier may be designated as the subscriber's interstate or interLATA  preferred interexchange carrier for any one telephone number. To the  extent that a jurisdiction allows the selection of additional preferred  carriers (e.g., local exchange, intraLATA toll, interLATA toll, or  international interexchange), the letter of agency must contain separate  statements regarding those choices, although a separate letter of agency  for each choice is not necessary; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That the subscriber may consult with the carrier as to whether a  fee will apply to the change in the subscriber's preferred carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any carrier designated in a letter of agency as a preferred  carrier must be the carrier directly setting the rates for the  subscriber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Letters of agency shall not suggest or require that a subscriber  take some action in order to retain the subscriber's current  telecommunications carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If any portion of a letter of agency is translated into another  language then all portions of the letter of agency must be translated  into that language. Every letter of agency must be translated into the  same language as any promotional materials, oral descriptions or  instructions provided with the letter of agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Letters of agency submitted with an electronically signed  authorization must include the consumer disclosures required by Section  101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A telecommunications carrier shall submit a preferred carrier  change order on behalf of a subscriber within no more than 60 days of  obtaining a written or electronically signed letter of agency. However,  letters of agency for multi-line and/or multi-location business  customers that have entered into negotiated agreements with carriers to  add presubscribed lines to their business locations during the course of  a term agreement shall be valid for the period specified in the term  agreement.
