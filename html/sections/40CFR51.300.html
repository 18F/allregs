                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The primary purposes of this subpart are to require  States to develop programs to assure reasonable progress toward meeting  the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing,  impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas which  impairment results from manmade air pollution; and to establish  necessary additional procedures for new source permit applicants, States  and Federal Land Managers to use in conducting the visibility impact  analysis required for new sources under Sec. 51.166. This subpart sets  forth requirements addressing visibility impairment in its two principal  forms: ``reasonably attributable'' impairment (i.e., impairment  attributable to a single source/small group of sources) and regional  haze (i.e., widespread haze from a multitude of sources which impairs  visibility in every direction over a large area).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicability--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General Applicability.
