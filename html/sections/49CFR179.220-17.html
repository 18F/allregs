                                Sec. 179.220-17  Gauging devices, top loading and unloading devices,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When installed, each device must be of approved design which  will prevent interchange with any other fixture and must be tightly  closed. Each unloading pipe must be securely anchored within the inner  container. Each inner container or compartment thereof may be equipped  with one separate air connection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the characteristics of the commodity for which the car is  authorized require these devices to be equipped with valves or fittings  to permit the loading and unloading of the contents, these devices  including valves, shall be provided with a protective housing except  when plug or ball-type valves with operating handles removed are used.  Provision must be made for closing pipe connections of valves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inner container may be equipped with a vacuum relief valve of  approved design. Protective housing is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a gauging device is required in Sec. 179.221-1, an outage  scale visible through the manway opening must be provided. If loading  devices are applied to permit tank loading with cover closed, a telltale  pipe may be provided. The telltail pipe must be capable of determining  that required outage is provided. The pipe must be equipped with \1/4\- inch maximum, NPT control valve mounted outside tank and enclosed within  a protective housing. Other approved devices may be used in place of an  outage scale or a telltale pipe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The bottom of the tank shell may be equipped with a sump or  siphon bowl, or both, welded or pressed into the shell. These sumps or  siphon bowls, if applied, are not limited in size and must be made of  cast, forged, or fabricated metal. Each sump or siphon bowl must be of  good welding quality in conjunction with the metal of the tank shell.  When the sump or siphon bowl is pressed in the bottom of the tank shell,  the wall thickness of the pressed section must not be less than that  specified for the shell. The section of a circular cross section tank to  which a sump or siphon bowl is attached need not comply with the out-of- roundness requirement specified in appendix W, W14.06 of the AAR  Specifications for Tank Cars. Any portion of a sump or siphon bowl not  forming a part of a cylinder of revolution must have walls of such  thickness and must be so reinforced that the stresses in the walls  caused by a given internal pressure are not greater than the  circumferential stress which would exist under the same internal  pressure in the wall of a tank of circular cross section designed in  accordance with Secs. 179.220-6(a) and 179.220-9. In no case shall the  wall thickness be less than that specified in Sec. 179.221-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Protective housing, when required, must be of approved material  and must have cover and sidewalls not less than 0.119 inch in thickness.
