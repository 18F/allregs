                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If, while an action is pending under section 8(a)(2) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(a)(2)), the Board of Directors, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency, finds that an insured depository institution (other than a special supervisory association to which Sec. 308.126 of this subpart applies) has no tangible capital under the capital guidelines or regulations of the appropriate Federal banking agency, the Board of Directors may issue a Temporary Order Suspending Deposit Insurance, pending completion of the proceedings under section 8(a)(2) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(a)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The temporary order shall be served upon the insured institution and

a copy sent to the appropriate Federal banking agency and to the appropriate State banking supervisor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The temporary order shall become effective ten days from the date of service upon the insured depository institution. Unless set aside, limited, or suspended in proceedings under section 8(a)(8)(D) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818 (a)(8)(D)), the temporary order shall remain effective and enforceable until an order terminating the insured status of the institution is entered by the Board of Directors and becomes final, or the Board of Directors dismisses the proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification to depositors of suspension of insured status. Within the time specified by the Board of Directors and prior to the suspension of insured status, the depository institution shall mail a notification of suspension of insured status to each depositor at the depositor's last address of record on the books of the depository institution. The depository institution shall also publish the notification in two issues of a local newspaper of general circulation and shall furnish the FDIC with proof of such publications.

Any deposits made by you after that date, either new deposits or additions to existing deposits, will not be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p><p class="depth2">3. Insured deposits in the (depository institution) (branch) on the -------- day of ------------, 19----, will continue to be insured for ------------ after the close of business on the---------- day of ----------, 19----.
