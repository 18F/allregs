                            <p class="depth0">To receive a State-lead remedial Cooperative Agreement, the applicant must submit the following items to EPA:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application form, as described in Sec. 35.6055(a). Applications for additional funding need to include only the revised pages. The application must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Budget sheets (SF-424A) displaying costs by site, activity and operable unit, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Project narrative statement, including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A site description, including a discussion of the location of each site, the physical characteristics of each site

(site geology and proximity to drinking water supplies), the nature of the release (contaminant type and affected media), past response actions at each site, and response actions still required at each site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A site-specific Statement of Work (SOW), including estimated costs per task, and a standard task to ensure that a sign is posted at the site providing the appropriate contacts for obtaining information on activities being conducted at the site, and for reporting suspected criminal activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement designating a lead site project manager among appropriate State offices. This statement must demonstrate that the lead State agency has conducted coordinated planning of response activities with other State agencies. The statement must identify the name and position of those individuals who will be responsible for coordinating the State offices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A site-specific Community Relations Plan or an assurance that field work will not begin until one is in place. The Regional community relations coordinator must approve the Community Relations Plan before the recipient begins field work. The recipient must comply with the community relations requirements described in EPA policy and guidance, and in the National Contingency Plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A site-specific health and safety plan, or an assurance that the applicant will have a final plan before starting field work. Unless specifically waived by the award official, the applicant must have a site-specific health and safety plan in place providing for the protection of on-site personnel and area residents. The site-specific health and safety plan must comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.120, entitled, ``Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,'' unless the recipient is an Indian Tribe exempt from OSHA requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Quality assurance--(A) General. If the project involves environmentally related measurements or data generation, the recipient must comply with the requirements regarding quality assurance described in 2 CFR 1500.11.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> General. If the project involves environmentally related measurements or data generation, the recipient must comply with the requirements regarding quality assurance described in 2 CFR 1500.11.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Quality assurance plan. The applicant must have a separate quality assurance project plan and/or sampling plan for each site to be covered by the Cooperative Agreement. The applicant must submit the quality assurance project plan and the sampling plan, which incorporates results of any site investigation performed at that site, to EPA with its Cooperative Agreement application. However, at the option of the EPA award official with program concurrence, the applicant may submit with its application a schedule for developing the detailed site-specific quality assurance plan (generally 45 days before beginning field work). Field work may not begin until EPA approves the site-specific quality assurance plan.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Split sampling. The quality assurance plan must comply with the requirements regarding split sampling described in section 104(e)(4)(B) of CERCLA, as amended.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A schedule of deliverables to be prepared during response activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other applicable forms and information authorized by 2 CFR part 200 Subpart C--Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CERCLA Assurances. Before a Cooperative Agreement for remedial action can be awarded, the State must provide EPA with the following written assurances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operation and maintenance. The State must provide an assurance that it will assume responsibility for all future operation and maintenance of CERCLA-funded remedial actions for the expected life of each such action as required by CERCLA section 104(c) and addressed in 40 CFR 300.510(c)(1) of the NCP. In addition, even if a political subdivision is designated as being responsible for operation and maintenance, the State must guarantee that it will assume any or all operation and maintenance activities in the event of default by the political subdivision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost sharing. The State must provide assurances for cost sharing as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ten percent. Where a facility, whether privately or publicly owned, was not operated by the State or political subdivision thereof, either directly or through a contractual relationship

or otherwise, at the time of any disposal of hazardous substances at the facility, the State must provide 10 percent of the cost of the remedial action, if CERCLA-funded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fifty percent or more. Where a facility was operated by a State or political subdivision either directly or through a contractual relationship or otherwise, at the time of any disposal of hazardous substances at the facility, the State must provide 50 percent (or such greater share as EPA may determine appropriate, taking into account the degree of responsibility of the State or political subdivision for the release) of the cost of removal, remedial planning, and remedial action if the remedial action is CERCLA-funded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Twenty-year waste capacity. The State must assure EPA of the availability of hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities within and/or outside the State that comply with subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and that have adequate capacity for the destruction, treatment, or secure disposition of all hazardous wastes that are reasonably expected to be generated within the State during the 20-year period following the date of the response agreement. A remedial action cannot be funded unless this assurance is provided consistent with 40 CFR 300.510 of the NCP. EPA will determine whether the State's assurance is adequate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Off-site storage, treatment, or disposal. If off-site storage, destruction, treatment, or disposal is required, the State must assure the availability of a hazardous waste disposal facility that is in compliance with subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and is acceptable to EPA. The lead agency of the State must provide the notification required at Sec. 35.6120, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Real property acquisition. If EPA determines in the remedy selection process that an interest in real property must be acquired in order to conduct a response action, such acquisition may be funded under a Cooperative Agreement. EPA may acquire an interest in real estate for the purpose of conducting a remedial action only if the State provides assurance that it will accept transfer of such interest in accordance with 40 CFR 300.510(f) of the NCP. The State must provide this assurance even if it intends to transfer this interest to a third party, or to allow a political subdivision to accept transfer on behalf of the State. If the political subdivision is accepting the transferred interest in real property, the State must guarantee that it will accept transfer of such interest in the event of default by the political subdivision. If the State or political subdivision disposes of the transferred real property, it shall comply with the requirements for real property in 2 CFR 200.311. (See Sec. 35.6400 for additional information on real property acquisition requirements.)
