                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 527 provides that a political organization is considered an  organization exempt from income taxes for the purpose of any law which  refers to organizations exempt from income taxes. A political  organization is subject to tax only to the extent provided in section  527. In general, a political organization is an organization that is  organized and operated primarily for an exempt function as defined in  Sec. 1.527-2(c). Section 527 provides that a political organization is  taxed on its political organization taxable income (see Sec. 1.527-4)  which, in general, does not include the exempt function income (see  Sec. 1.527-3) of the political organization. Furthermore, section 527  provides that an exempt organization, other than a political  organization, may be subject to   tax under section 527 when it expends an amount for an exempt function,  see Sec. 1.527-6. The taxation of newsletter funds is provided under  section 527(g) and Sec. 1.527-7. A special rule for principal campaign  committees is provided under section 527(h) and Sec. 1.527-9.
