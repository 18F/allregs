The vessel owner or operator must ensure that the following background information is provided to the person or persons who will conduct the on-scene survey and assessment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General layout of the vessel, including the location of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each actual or potential point of access to the vessel and its function;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Spaces that should have restricted access;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Essential maintenance equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cargo spaces and storage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Storage of unaccompanied baggage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Vessel stores;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Threat assessments, including the purpose and methodology of the assessment, for the area or areas in which the vessel operates or at which passengers embark or disembark;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The previous VSA, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Emergency and stand-by equipment available to maintain essential services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Number of vessel personnel and any existing security duties to which they are assigned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Existing personnel training requirement practices of the vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Existing security and safety equipment for the protection of personnel, visitors, passengers, and vessels personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Escape and evacuation routes and assembly stations that have to be maintained to ensure the orderly and safe emergency evacuation of the vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Existing agreements with private security companies providing waterside or vessel security services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Existing security measures and procedures, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection and control procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identification systems;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Surveillance and monitoring equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Personnel identification documents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Communication systems;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Alarms;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Lighting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Access control systems; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Other security systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On-scene survey. The vessel owner or operator must ensure that an on-scene survey of each vessel is conducted. The on-scene survey is to verify or collect information required in paragraph (a) of this section. It consists of an actual survey that examines and evaluates existing vessel protective measures, procedures, and operations for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensuring performance of all security duties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Controlling access to the vessel, through the use of identification systems or otherwise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Controlling the embarkation of vessel personnel and other persons and their effects, including personal effects and baggage whether accompanied or unaccompanied;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supervising the handling of cargo and the delivery of vessel stores;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitoring restricted areas to ensure that only authorized persons have access;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Monitoring deck areas and areas surrounding the vessel; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The ready availability of security communications, information, and equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Analysis and recommendations.
