                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A Presiding Officer shall have the duty to conduct  full, fair, and impartial hearings, to take appropriate action to avoid  unnecessary delay in the disposition of proceedings, and to maintain  order. He or she shall have all powers necessary to that end, including  the following powers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To administer oaths and affirmations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To compel discovery and to impose appropriate sanctions for  failure to make discovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To issue subpoenas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant and probative  evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To regulate the course of the hearings and the conduct of the  parties and their representatives therein;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To hold conferences for simplification of the issues, settlement  of the proceedings, or any other proper purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To consider and rule, orally or in writing, upon all procedural  and other motions appropriate in an adjudicative proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To issue initial decisions, rulings, and orders, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To certify questions to the Administrator for determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> To take any action authorized in this part or in conformance  with the provisions of title 5, U.S.C., sections 551 through 559.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion of parties by Presiding Officer. A Presiding Officer  shall have the authority, for good cause stated on the record, to  exclude from participation in a proceeding any party, participant, and/ or representative who shall violate requirements of Sec. 511.76. Any  party, participant and/or representative so excluded may appeal to the  Administrator in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 511.23. If the  representative of a party or participant is excluded, the hearing shall  be suspended for a reasonable time so that the party or participant may  obtain another representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Substitution of Presiding Officer. In the event of the  substitution of a new Presiding Officer for the one originally  designated, any motion predicated upon such substitution shall be made  within five (5) days of the substitution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interference. In the performance of adjudicative functions, a  Presiding Officer shall not be responsible to or subject to the  supervision or direction of the Administrator or of any officer,  employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or  prosecuting functions for NHTSA. All directions by the Administrator to  a Presiding Officer concerning any adjudicative proceeding shall appear  on and be made a part of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disqualification of Presiding Officer. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a Presiding  Officer deems himself or herself disqualified to preside in a particular  proceeding, he or she shall withdraw by notice on the record and shall  notify the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whenever, for any reason, any party shall deem the Presiding  Officer to be disqualified to preside, or to continue to preside, in a  particular proceeding, that party may file with the Chief Administrative  Law Judge a motion to disqualify and remove, supported by affidavit(s)  setting forth the alleged grounds for disqualification. A copy of the  motion and supporting affidavit(s) shall be served by the Chief  Administrative Law Judge on the Presiding Officer whose removal is  sought. The Presiding Officer shall have ten (10) days from service to  reply in writing. Such motion shall not stay the proceeding unless  otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the Administrator. If the  Presiding Officer does not disqualify himself or herself, the  Administrator will determine the validity of the grounds alleged, either  directly or on the report of another Presiding Officer appointed to  conduct a hearing for that purpose, and shall in the event of  disqualification take appropriate action, by assigning another Presiding   Officer or requesting assignment of another Administrative Law Judge  through the Office of Hearings.  [45 FR 81578, Dec. 11, 1980, as amended at 53 FR 15783, May 3, 1988]</p>
