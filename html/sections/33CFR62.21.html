                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The navigable waters of the United States and non-navigable  State waters after December 31, 2003, are marked to assist navigation  using the U.S. Aids to Navigation System, a system consistent with the  International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Maritime  Buoyage System. The IALA Maritime Buoyage System is followed by most of  the world's maritime nations and will improve maritime safety by  encouraging conformity in buoyage systems worldwide. IALA buoyage is  divided into two regions made up of Region A and Region B. All navigable  waters of the United States follow IALA Region B, except U.S.  possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 10 degrees  north latitude, which follow IALA Region A. Lateral aids to navigation  in Region A vary from those described throughout this Subpart. Non- lateral aids to navigation are the same as those used in Region B. See  Sec.  62.25. Appropriate nautical charts and publications should be  consulted to determine whether the Region A or Region B marking schemes  are in effect for a given area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with  nautical charts. Nautical charts portray the physical features of the  marine environment, including soundings and other submarine features,  landmarks, and other aids necessary for the proper navigation of a  vessel. This crucial information cannot be obtained from other sources,  even ones such as topographic maps, aeronautical charts, or atlases. The  exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear to the mariner  unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the chart illustrates the  relationship of the individual aid to navigation to channel limits,  obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the total aids to navigation  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The navigator should maintain and consult suitable publications  and instruments for navigation depending on the vessel's requirements.  This shipboard equipment is separate from the aids to navigation system,  but is often   essential to its use. The following publications are available from the  U.S. Government to assist the navigator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Light List, published by the Coast Guard and available  through the Government Printing Office or authorized sales agents, lists  federal and private aids to navigation. It includes all major Federal  aids to navigation and those private aids to navigation, which have been  deemed to be important to general navigation, and includes a physical  description of these aids and their locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The United States Coast Pilot, published by the National Ocean  Service and available through that agency or authorized nautical chart  sales agents, supplements the information shown on nautical charts.  Subjects such as local navigation regulations, channel and anchorage  peculiarities, dangers, climatalogical data, routes, and port facilities  are covered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Local Notices to Mariners are published by local Coast Guard  District Commanders. Persons may be placed on the mailing list to  receive local Notices by contacting the Aids to Navigation and Waterway  Management Branch of the appropriate Coast Guard District. These notices  pass information affecting navigation safety. Changes to aids to  navigation, reported dangers, scheduled construction or other  disruptions, chart corrections and similar useful marine information is  made available through this publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Notice to Mariners is a national publication, similar to the  Local Notice to Mariners, published by the National Imagery and Mapping  Agency. The notice may be obtained free of charge from commercial  maritime sources and, upon request, to Defense Logistics Agency, Defense  Supply Center Richmond, ATTN: JNB, 8000 Jefferson Davis Highway,  Richmond, VA 23297-5100 or FAX 804-279-6510, ATTN: Accounts Manager,  RMF. A letter of justification should be included in the request. This  publication provides ocean going vessels significant information on  national and international navigation and safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The mariner should also listen to Coast Guard Broadcast Notices  to Mariners. These broadcasts update the Local Notice to Mariners with  more timely information. Mariners should monitor VHF-FM channel 16 to  locate Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is primarily a lateral system  which employs a simple arrangement of colors, shapes, numbers, and light  characteristics to mark the limits of navigable routes. This lateral  system is supplemented by nonlateral aids to navigation where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Generally, lateral aids to navigation indicate on which side of  a vessel an aid to navigation should be passed when the vessel is  proceeding in the Conventional Direction of Buoyage. Normally, the  Conventional Direction of Buoyage is the direction in which a vessel  enters navigable channels from seaward and proceeds towards the head of  navigation. In the absence of a route leading from seaward, the  Conventional Direction of Buoyage generally follows a clockwise  direction around land masses. For example, proceeding southerly along  the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Texas along the Gulf Coast, and  northerly along the Pacific Coast are considered as proceeding in the  Conventional Direction of Buoyage. In some instances, this direction  must be arbitrarily assigned. Where doubt exists, the mariner should  consult charts and other nautical publications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Although aids to navigation are maintained to a reasonable  degree of reliability, the rigors of the marine environment and various  equipment failures do cause discrepancies on occasion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Coast Guard makes reasonable efforts to inform the navigator  of known discrepancies, and to correct them within a reasonable period  of time, depending upon resources available. Occasionally, a temporary  aid to navigation, which provides different but similar service, is  deployed until permanent repairs can be made to the original aid.  Notification of such temporary changes is made through the notice to  mariners system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Mariners should exercise caution when using private aids to  navigation because private aids are often established to serve the needs  of specific users rather than general navigation   and their purpose may not be obvious to casual users; and, discrepancies  to private aids are often detected, reported, and corrected less  promptly than discrepancies to Coast Guard aids to navigation.
