In accordance with the general regulations in 33 CFR 165.33, no person or vessel may enter or move within a security zone created by this section while that security zone is being enforced unless granted permission to do so by the Coast Guard's First District Commander, the COTP, or a designated representative. Vessel operators and persons given permission to enter or operate in a security zone must comply with all directions given to them by the COTP, or a designated representative. Upon being hailed by a U.S. Coast Guard or other duly authorized law enforcement vessel (e.g., New York City police) by siren, radio, flashing lights, or other means, the operator of a vessel must proceed as directed, and follow any instructions to anchor or moor up to a waterfront facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enforcement periods. The security zone described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is subject to enforcement at all times. All other security zones established by this section will only be enforced when necessary to protect dignitaries as determined by the COTP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification. Because the security zone described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is subject to enforcement at all times, the Coast Guard will not necessarily take any action to further notify the public about the enforcement of that zone. As for the enforcement periods for the other security zones contained herein, the Coast Guard will rely on the methods described in 33 CFR 165.7 to notify the public of the time and duration of any enforcement period. The COTP may also notify the public about enforcement of these security zones via http://homeport.uscg.mil/newyork.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contact information. Vessel operators desiring to enter or operate within a security zone shall telephone the COTP at 718-354-4356 or a designated representative via VHF channel 16 to obtain permission to do so.
