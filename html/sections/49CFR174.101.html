                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Boxes containing Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials must  be loaded so that the ends of wooden boxes will not bear against sides  of any fiberboard boxes and so that the ends of any box will not cause a  pressure point on a small area of another box.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Explosive bombs, unfuzed projectiles, rocket ammunition and  rocket motors, Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, which  are not packed in wooden boxes, or large metal packages of incendiary  bombs, each weighing 226 kg (500 pounds) or more, may be loaded in stock  cars or in flat bottom gondola cars only if they are adequately braced.  Boxed bombs, rocket ammunition and rocket motors, Division 1.1, 1.2, or  1.3 (explosive) materials, which due to their size cannot be loaded in  closed cars, may be loaded in open-top cars or on flatcars, provided  they are protected from the weather and accidental ignition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boxes of Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials packed in  long cartridges, bags, or sift-proof liners, and containing no liquid  explosive ingredient, may be loaded on their sides or ends.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials may not be loaded  higher than any permanent car lining unless additional lining is  provided as high as the lading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the lading of a car includes any Class 1 (explosive)  materials, the weight of the lading must be distributed insofar as  possible to equalize the weight on each side of the car and over the  trucks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except when boxed, metal kegs containing Class 1 (explosive)  materials must be loaded on their sides with their ends toward the ends  of the car. Packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials may not be placed  in the space opposite the doors unless the doorways are boarded on the  inside as high as the lading. This paragraph does not apply to  palletized packages if they are braced so they cannot fall or slide into  the doorways during transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Wooden kegs, fiber kegs, barrels, and drums must be loaded on  their sides or ends, to best suit the conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Packages containing any Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive)  materials for (see Sec. 174.104), detonators, detonator assemblies, or  boosters with detonators must be securely blocked and braced to prevent  the packages from changing position, falling to the floor, or sliding  into each other, under conditions normally incident to transportation.  Class 1 (explosive) materials must be loaded so as to avoid transfer at  stations. For recommended methods of blocking and bracing, see Bureau of  Explosives Pamphlets No. 6 and 6A. Heavy packages or containers must be  trucked, rolled, or moved by skids, fork trucks, or other handling  devices and may not be dropped from trucks, platforms, or cars. Planks  for rolling trucks from platforms to cars must have beveled ends.  Loading platforms and the shoes of each workman must be free from grit.  All possible precautions must be taken against fire. Class 1 (explosive)  materials must be kept in a safe place and inaccessible to unauthorized  persons while being held by a carrier for loading or delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> To prevent delays of local freight trains, when there are  shipments of Class 1 (explosive) materials for different destinations  loaded in a ``peddler car'' or ``way car'' the shipment for each  destination must be stayed separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Forwarding and transfer stations for Class 1 (explosive)  materials must be provided with the necessary materials for staying.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Shippers must furnish the material for staying packages of Class  1 (explosive) materials loaded by them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials may not be loaded,  transported, or stored in a rail car equipped with any type of lighted  heater or open-flame device, or electric devices having exposed heating  coils, or in a rail car equipped with any apparatus or mechanism  utilizing an internal combustion engine in its operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A container car or freight container on a flatcar or a gondola  car other than a drop-bottom car, when properly loaded, blocked, and  braced to prevent change of position under conditions normally incident  to transportation, may be used to transport any Division 1.1 or 1.2  (explosive) material except black powder packed in metal containers. A  freight container must be designed, constructed, and maintained so as to  be weather tight and capable of preventing the entrance of sparks. In  addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A freight container must be of such design and so braced as to  show no evidence of failure of the container or the bracing when  subjected to impact from each end of at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per  hour. Its efficiency shall be determined by actual test, using dummy  loads equal in weight and general character to material to be shipped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A container car or car which is loaded with freight containers  must be placarded with the Class 1 (explosive) materials placards as  required by subpart F of part 172 of this subchapter and with properly  executed car certificates as required by Sec. 174.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lading must be so loaded, blocked, and braced within the freight  container that it will not change position under impact from each end of  at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials may be loaded  and transported in a tight closed truck body or   trailer on a flatcar. Wooden boxed bombs, rocket ammunition, and rocket  motors, Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, which due to  their size cannot be loaded in tight, closed truck bodies or trailers,  may be loaded in or on open-top truck bodies or trailers. However, they  must be protected against accidental ignition. In addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each truck body or trailer must meet the requirements of part  177 of this subchapter, applicable to shipments of Class 1 (explosive)  materials by motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each truck body or trailer must be secured on the rail car so  that it will not permanently change position or show evidence of failure  or impending failure of the method of securing the truck body or trailer  under impact from each end of at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per hour. Its  efficiency must be determined by actual test, using dummy loads equal in  weight and general character to the material to be shipped. For  recommended methods of blocking and bracing, see the Intermodal Loading  Guide for Products in Closed Trailers and Containers (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Lading must be loaded, blocked, and braced within or on the  truck body or trailer so that the lading will not change position under  impact from each end of at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per hour. For  recommended methods of blocking and bracing, see the Intermodal Loading  Guide for Products in Closed Trailers and Containers (IBR, see  Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each rail car containing Class 1 (explosive) materials and each  rail car loaded with truck bodies, trailers or containers containing  Class 1 (explosive) materials must be placarded with Class 1 (explosive)  materials placards as required by subpart F of part 172 of this  subchapter and with properly executed car certificates as required by  Sec. 174.104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each fuel tank of a heater or refrigerating machinery on the  truck bodies or trailers must be drained and all automatic heating or  refrigerating machinery must be made inoperative by disconnection of the  automatic controls or the source of power for their operations.
