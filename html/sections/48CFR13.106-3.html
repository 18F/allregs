                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis for award. Before making award, the contracting officer  must determine that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever possible, base price reasonableness on competitive  quotations or offers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If only one response is received, include a statement of price  reasonableness in the contract file. The contracting officer may base  the statement on--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Market research;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable  on previous purchases;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Current price lists, catalogs, or advertisements. However,  inclusion of a price in a price list, catalog, or advertisement does  not, in and of itself, establish fairness and reasonableness of the  price;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A comparison with similar items in a related industry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The contracting officer's personal knowledge of the item being  purchased;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Comparison to an independent Government estimate; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Any other reasonable basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Occasionally an item can be obtained only from a supplier that  quotes a minimum order price or quantity that either unreasonably  exceeds stated quantity requirements or results in an unreasonable price  for the quantity required. In these instances, the contracting officer  should inform the requiring activity of all facts regarding the  quotation or offer and ask it to confirm or alter its requirement. The  file shall be documented to support the final action taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> File documentation and retention. Keep documentation to a  minimum. Purchasing offices shall retain data supporting purchases  (paper or electronic) to the minimum extent and duration necessary for  management review purposes (see subpart 4.8). The following illustrate  the extent to which quotation or offer information should be recorded:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Oral solicitations. The contracting office should establish and  maintain records of oral price quotations in order to reflect clearly  the propriety of placing the order at the price paid with the supplier  concerned. In most cases, this will consist merely of showing the names  of the suppliers contacted and the prices and other terms and conditions  quoted by each.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written solicitations (see 2.101). For acquisitions not  exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, limit written records of  solicitations or offers to notes or abstracts to show prices, delivery,  references to printed price lists used, the supplier or suppliers  contacted, and other pertinent data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special situations. Include additional statements--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand  name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does  not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an  acquisition of utility services available from only one source); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Supporting the award decision if other than price-related  factors were considered in selecting the supplier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. For acquisitions that do not exceed the simplified  acquisition threshold and for which automatic notification is not  provided through an electronic commerce method that employs widespread  electronic public notice, notification to unsuccessful suppliers shall  be given only if requested or required by 5.301.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Request for information. If a supplier requests information on  an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief  explanation of the basis for the contract award decision shall be  provided (see 15.503(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Taxpayer Identification Number. If an oral solicitation is used,  the contracting officer shall ensure that the copy of the award document  sent to the payment office is annotated with the contractor's Taxpayer  Identification Number (TIN) and type of organization (see 4.203), unless  this information will be obtained from some other source (e.g.,  centralized database). The contracting officer shall disclose to the  contractor that the TIN may be used by the Government to collect and  report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the contractor's  relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).
