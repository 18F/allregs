However, prior to returning the notice if there is sufficient time, an attempt should be made to inform the authorized person who caused the notice to be served, that it will not be honored unless adequate information is supplied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Upon receipt of effective notice of delinquent support payments, together with all required supplementary documents and information, the designated official shall identify the officer from whom moneys are due and payable. The allotment shall be established in the amount necessary to comply with the support order and to liquidate arrearages if provided by a support order when the maximum amount to be allotted under this provision, together with any other moneys withheld for support from the officer, does not exceed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 50 percent of the officer's disposable earnings for any month where the officer asserts by affidavit or other acceptable evidence, that he/she is supporting a spouse and/or dependent child, other than a party in the support order.

In the event such consultation is not possible, despite continuing good faith efforts to arrange a consultation, no action shall be taken to require an allotment from the pay and allowances of any NOAA Corps Officer until 30 days have elapsed after the notice described in paragraph (d)(1) is given to the affected officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If, within 30 days of the date of the notice, the officer has furnished the designated official affidavits or other documentation showing the information in the notice to be in error, the designated official shall consider the

officer's response.

(1) The authorized person or allottee shall notify the designated official promptly if the operative court order upon which the allotment is based is vacated, modified, or set aside. The designated official shall also be notified of any events affecting the allottee's eligibility to receive the allotment, such as the former spouse's remarriage, if a part of the payment is for spousal support, and notice of a change in eligibility for child support payments under circumstances of death, emancipation, adoption, or attainment of majority of a child whose support is provided through the allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An allotment established under this Directive shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from the authorized person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Neither the Department of Commerce nor any officer or employee thereof, shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due from, or payable by, the Department of Commerce to any individuals pursuant to notice regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this subpart. If a designated official receives notice based on support which, on its face, appears to conform to the law of the jurisdiction from which it was issued, the designated official shall not be required to ascertain whether the authority that issued the orde had obtained personal jurisdiction over the member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date of allotment. The allotment shall start with the first pay period beginning after the officer has had a consultation with an attorney from the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Administration but not later than the first pay period beginning after 30 days have elapsed since the notice required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is given to the affected officer.
