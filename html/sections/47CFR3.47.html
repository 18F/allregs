                            <p class="depth0">An accounting authority must accept accounts presented to it from  foreign administrations in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). These SDRs  must be converted to dollars on the date of receipt by the accounting  authority and an equivalent amount in US dollars must be paid to the  foreign administration. The conversion rate will be the applicable rate  published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the date of  receipt of the account from the foreign administration. Upon written  concurrence by the FCC, any accounting authority may make separate  agreements, in writing, with foreign administrations or their agents for  alternative settlement methods, provided account is taken of ITU-T  Recommendation D.195.</p>
