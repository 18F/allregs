Sec. 162.45, 162.46, and 162.47 do not  apply. Such cases shall be referred to the U.S. attorney. The Fines,  Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may request the U.S. attorney to seek  a decree of forfeiture providing for delivery of the property to the  Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for sale or other appropriate  disposition, if such property is not to be retained for official use.
