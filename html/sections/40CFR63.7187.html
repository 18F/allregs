                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct each performance test in Table 1 to this subpart

that applies to you as specified for process vents in Sec. 63.982(a)(2) and storage tanks in Sec. 63.982(a)(1). Performance tests must be conducted under maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential. Section 63.982(a)(1) and (2) only includes methods to measure the total organic regulated material or total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. The EPA Methods 26 and 26A are included in Table 1 to this subpart in addition to the test methods contained within Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2). The EPA Method 26 or 26A must be used for testing regulated material containing inorganic HAP. Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, must be used to measure total vapor phase organic and inorganic HAP concentrations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, without the use of a control device, your process vent stream has an organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv or less or an inorganic HAP concentration of 0.42 ppmv or less, or your storage tank vent stream has an inorganic HAP concentration of 0.42 ppmv or less, you may demonstrate that the vent stream is compliant by engineering assessments and calculations or by conducting the applicable performance test requirements specified in Table 1 to this subpart. Your engineering assessments and calculations, as with performance tests (as specified in Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2)), must represent your maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential and must be approved by the Administrator. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by certifying that your operations will not exceed the maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential represented by your engineering assessments, calculations, or performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are using a control device to comply with the emission limitations in Sec. 63.7184 and the inlet concentration of HAP to the control device is 20 ppmv or less, then you may demonstrate that the control device meets the percent by weight HAP emission reduction limitation in Sec. 63.7184(c)(1) or (d)(1) by conducting a design evaluation as specified in paragraph (i) of this section. Your design evaluation must represent your maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential and must be approved by the Administrator. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by certifying that your operations will not exceed the maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential represented by your design evaluation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each monitoring system required in this section, you must develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the criteria specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Installation of the continuous monitoring system (CMS) sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In your site-specific monitoring plan, you must also address the procedural processes in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(c)(1), (3), (4)(ii), (7), and (8);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation according to the site-specific monitoring plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets the required percent by weight inorganic HAP emission reduction limitation in Sec. 63.7184(c)(1) or (d)(1), a design evaluation must address the composition of

the inorganic HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration must also consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser must be measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound con-centration level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and will include the additional information in paragraphs (i)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed section.
