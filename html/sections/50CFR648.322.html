                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allocation of TAL. (1) A total of 66.5 percent of the annual skate complex TAL shall be allocated to the skate wing fishery. All skate products that are landed in wing form, for the skate wing market, or classified by Federal dealers as food as required under Sec. 648.7(a)(1)(i), shall count against the skate wing fishery TAL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A total of 66.5 percent of the annual skate complex TAL shall be allocated to the skate wing fishery. All skate products that are landed in wing form, for the skate wing market, or classified by Federal dealers as food as required under Sec. 648.7(a)(1)(i), shall count against the skate wing fishery TAL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A total of 33.5 percent of the annual TAL shall be allocated to the skate bait fishery. All skate products that are landed for the skate bait market, or classified by Federal dealers as bait as required under Sec. 648.7(a)(1)(i), shall count against the skate bait fishery TAL. The annual skate bait fishery TAL shall be allocated in three seasonal quota periods as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Season 1-May 1 through July 31, 30.8 percent of the annual skate bait fishery TAL shall be allocated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Season 2-August 1 through October 31, 37.1 percent of the annual skate bait fishery TAL shall be allocated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Season 3-November 1 through April 30, the remainder of the annual skate bait fishery TAL not landed in Seasons 1 or 2 shall be allocated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Skate wing possession and landing limits. A vessel or operator of a vessel that has been issued a valid Federal skate permit under this part, and fishes under an Atlantic sea scallop, NE multispecies, or monkfish DAS as specified at Secs. 648.53, 648.82, and 648.92, respectively, unless otherwise exempted under Sec. 648.80 or paragraph (c) of this section, may fish for, possess, and/or land up to the allowable trip limits specified as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Up to 2,600 lb (1,179 kg) of skate wings (5,902 lb (2,677 kg) whole weight) per trip from May 1 through August 31, and 4,100 lb (1,860 kg) of skate wings (9,307 lb (4,222 kg) whole weight) per trip from September 1 through April 30, except for a vessel fishing on a declared NE multispecies Category B DAS described under Sec. 648.85(b), which is limited to no more than 220 lb (100 kg) of skate wings (500 lb (227 kg) whole weight) per trip (or any prorated combination of skate wings and whole skates based on the conversion factor for wing weight to whole weight of 2.27--for example, 100 lb (45.4 kg) of skate wings x 2.27 = 227 lb (103.1 kg) of whole skates).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In-season adjustment of skate wing possession limits. When the Regional Administrator projects that 85 percent of the annual skate wing fishery TAL has been landed, the Regional Administrator shall, through a notice in the Federal Register consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, reduce the skate wing trip limit to 500 lb (227 kg) of skate wings (1,135 lb (515 kg) whole weight, or any prorated combination of skate wings and whole skates based on the conversion factor for wing weight to whole weight of 2.27) for the remainder of the fishing year, unless such a reduction would be expected to prevent attainment of the annual TAL.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Incidental possession limit for vessels not under a DAS. A vessel issued a Federal skate permit that is not fishing under an Atlantic sea scallop, NE

multispecies, or monkfish DAS as specified at Secs. 648.53, 648.82, and 648.92, respectively, or is a limited access multispecies vessel participating in an approved sector described under Sec. 648.87 but not fishing on one of the DAS specified at Secs. 648.53, 648.82, or 648.92, may retain up to 500 lb (227 kg) of skate wings or 1,135 lb (515 kg) of whole skate, or any prorated combination of skate wings and whole skates based on the conversion factor for wing weight to whole weight of 2.27, per trip.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allowable forms of skate landings. Except for vessels fishing under a skate bait letter of authorization as specified at Sec. 648.322(c), a vessel may possess and/or land skates as wings only (wings removed from the body of the skate and the remaining carcass discarded), wings with associated carcasses possessed separately (wings removed from the body of the skate but the associated carcass retained on board the vessel), or in whole (intact) form, or any combination of the three, provided that the weight of the skate carcasses on board the vessel does not exceed 1.27 times the weight of skate wings on board. When any combination of skate wings, carcasses, and whole skates are possessed and/or landed, the applicable possession or landing limit shall be based on the whole weight limit, in which any wings are converted to whole weight using the wing to whole weight conversion factor of 2.27. For example, if the vessel possesses 100 lb (45.4 kg) of skate wings, the whole weight equivalent would be 227 lb (103.0 kg) of whole skates (100 lb (45.4 kg) x 2.27), and the vessel could possess up to 127 lb (57.6 kg) of skate carcasses (100 lb (45.4 kg) of skate wings x 1.27). A vessel may not possess and/or land skate carcasses and only whole skates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bait Letter of Authorization (LOA). A skate vessel owner or operator under this part may request and receive from the Regional Administrator an exemption from the skate wing possession limit restrictions for a minimum of 7 consecutive days, provided that when the vessel is fishing pursuant to the terms of authorization at least the following requirements and conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The vessel owner or operator obtains and retains onboard the vessel a valid LOA. LOAs are available upon request from the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vessel owner or operator possesses and/or lands only whole skates less than 23 inches (58.42 cm) total length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The vessel owner or operator fishes for, possesses, or lands skates only for use as bait.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The vessel owner or operator possesses or lands no more than 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) of only whole skates less than 23 inches (58.42 cm) total length, and does not possess or land any skate wings or whole skates greater than 23 inches (58.42 cm) total length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Vessels that choose to possess or land skate wings during the participation period of this letter of authorization must comply with possession limit restrictions under paragraph (b) of this section for all skates or skate parts on board. Vessels possessing skate wings in compliance with the possession limit restrictions under paragraph (b) may fish for, possess, or land skates for uses other than bait.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The vessel owner or operator complies with the transfer at sea requirements at Sec. 648.13(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In-season adjustment of skate bait possession limits. When the Regional Administrator projects that 90 percent of the skate bait fishery seasonal quota has been landed in Seasons 1 or 2, or 90 percent of the annual skate bait fishery TAL has been landed, the Regional Administrator shall, through a notice in the Federal Register consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, reduce the skate bait trip limit to the whole weight equivalent of the skate wing trip limit specified under paragraph (b) of this section for the remainder of the quota period, unless such a reduction would be expected to prevent attainment of the seasonal quota or annual TAL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibitions on possession of skates. A vessel fishing in the EEZ portion of the Skate Management Unit may not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retain, possess, or land barndoor or thorny skates taken in or from the EEZ portion of the Skate Management Unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retain, possess, or land smooth skates taken in or from the GOM RMA described at Sec. 648.80(a)(1)(i).
