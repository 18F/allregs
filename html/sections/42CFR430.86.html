Rules 26-37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures apply to such proceedings; there will be no fixed rule on priority of discovery. Upon written motion, the presiding officer promptly rules upon any objection to discovery action initiated under this section. The presiding officer also has the power to grant a protective order or relief to any party against whom discovery is sought and to restrict or control discovery so as to prevent undue delay in the conduct of the hearing. Upon the failure of any party to make discovery, the presiding officer may issue any order and impose any sanction (other than contempt orders) authorized by Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
