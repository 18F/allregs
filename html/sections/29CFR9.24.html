In addition to satisfying any costs imposed under Sec. Sec. 9.34(j) or 9.35(d) of this part, a contractor who violates any provision of this part shall take appropriate action to abate the violation, which may include hiring each affected employee in a position on the contract

for which the employee is qualified, together with compensation (including lost wages), terms, conditions, and privileges of that employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Withholding of funds. (1) Unpaid wages or other relief. After an investigation and a determination by the Administrator that lost wages or other monetary relief is due, the Administrator may direct that so much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government shall be withheld as are necessary to pay the moneys due. Upon the final order of the Secretary that such moneys are due, the Administrator may direct that such withheld funds be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unpaid wages or other relief.

Neither an order for debarment of any contractor or subcontractor from further Government contracts under this section nor the inclusion of a contractor or subcontractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors shall be carried out without affording the contractor or subcontractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
