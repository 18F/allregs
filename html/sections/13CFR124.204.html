                                Sec. 124.204  How does SBA process applications for 8(a) BD program
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BD program  participation within 90 days of receipt of a complete application  package by the DPCE. Incomplete packages will not be processed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SBA, in its sole discretion, may request clarification of  information contained in the application at any time in the application  process. SBA will take into account any clarifications made by an  applicant in response to a request for such by SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility is on the  applicant concern. If a concern does not provide requested information  within the allotted time provided by SBA, or if it submits incomplete  information, SBA may presume that disclosure of the missing information  would adversely affect the firm or would demonstrate lack of eligibility  in the area to which the information relates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An applicant must be eligible as of the date the AA/BD issues a  decision. The decision will be based on the facts set forth in the  application, any information received in response to SBA's request for  clarification made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and any  changed circumstances since the date of application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Changed circumstances for an applicant concern occurring  subsequent to its application and which adversely affect eligibility  will be considered and may constitute grounds for decline. The applicant  must inform SBA of any changed circumstances that could adversely affect  its eligibility for the program (particularly economic disadvantage and  ownership and control) during   its application review. Failure to inform SBA of any such changed  circumstances constitutes good cause for which SBA may terminate the  Participant if non-compliance is discovered after admittance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The decision of the AA/BD to approve or deny an application will  be in writing. A decision to deny admission will state the specific  reasons for denial, and will inform the applicant of any appeal rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the AA/BD approves the application, the date of the approval  letter is the date of program certification for purposes of determining  the concern's program term.
