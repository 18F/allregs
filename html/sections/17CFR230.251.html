                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Tier 1 and Tier 2. A public offer or sale of eligible securities, as defined in Rule 261 (Sec.  230.261), pursuant to Regulation A shall be exempt under section 3(b) from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tier 1. Offerings pursuant to Regulation A in which the sum of all cash and other consideration to be received for the securities being offered (``aggregate offering price'') plus the gross proceeds for all securities sold pursuant to other offering statements within the 12 months before the start of and during the current offering of securities (``aggregate sales'') does not exceed $20,000,000, including not more than $6,000,000 offered by all selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer (``Tier 1 offerings'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tier 2. Offerings pursuant to Regulation A in which the sum of the aggregate offering price and aggregate sales does not exceed $50,000,000, including not more than $15,000,000 offered by all selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer (``Tier 2 offerings'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional limitation on secondary sales in first year. The portion of the aggregate offering price attributable to the securities of selling securityholders shall not exceed 30% of the aggregate offering price of a particular offering in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The issuer's first offering pursuant to Regulation A; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any subsequent Regulation A offering that is qualified within one year of the qualification date of the issuer's first offering.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0">Where a mixture of cash and non-cash consideration is to be received, the aggregate offering price must be based on the price at which the securities are offered for cash. Any portion of the aggregate offering price or aggregate sales attributable to cash received in a foreign currency must be translated into United States currency at a currency exchange rate in effect on, or at a reasonable time before, the

date of the sale of the securities. If securities are not offered for cash, the aggregate offering price or aggregate sales must be based on the value of the consideration as established by bona fide sales of that consideration made within a reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair value as determined by an accepted standard. Valuations of non-cash consideration must be reasonable at the time made. If convertible securities or warrants are being offered and such securities are convertible, exercisable, or exchangeable within one year of the offering statement's qualification or at the discretion of the issuer, the underlying securities must also be qualified and the aggregate offering price must include the actual or maximum estimated conversion, exercise, or exchange price of such securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Issuer. The issuer of the securities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is an entity organized under the laws of the United States or Canada, or any State, Province, Territory or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, with its principal place of business in the United States or Canada;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) immediately before the offering;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is not a development stage company that either has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with or acquire an unidentified company or companies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is not an investment company registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) or a business development company as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Is not issuing fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, or a similar interest in other mineral rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Is not, and has not been, subject to any order of the Commission entered pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l(j)) within five years before the filing of the offering statement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Has filed with the Commission all reports required to be filed, if any, pursuant to Rule 257 (Sec.  230.257) during the two years before the filing of the offering statement (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Is not disqualified under Rule 262 (Sec.  230.262).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Integration with other offerings.

(i) No sale of securities may be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Until the offering statement has been qualified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By issuers that are not currently required to file reports pursuant to Rule 257(b) (Sec.  230.257(b)), until a Preliminary Offering Circular is delivered at least 48 hours before the sale to any person that before qualification of the

offering statement had indicated an interest in purchasing securities in the offering, including those persons that responded to an issuer's solicitation of interest materials; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In a Tier 2 offering of securities that are not listed on a registered national securities exchange upon qualification, unless the purchaser is either an accredited investor (as defined in Rule 501 (Sec.  230.501)) or the aggregate purchase price to be paid by the purchaser for the securities (including the actual or maximum estimated conversion, exercise, or exchange price for any underlying securities that have been qualified) is no more than ten percent (10%) of the greater of such purchaser's:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual income or net worth if a natural person (with annual income and net worth for such natural person purchasers determined as provided in Rule 501 (Sec.  230.501)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revenue or net assets for such purchaser's most recently completed fiscal year end if a non-natural person.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C).</p><p class="depth0">When securities underlying warrants or convertible securities are being qualified pursuant to Tier 2 of Regulation A one year or more after the qualification of an offering for which investment limitations previously applied, purchasers of the underlying securities for which investment limitations would apply at that later date may determine compliance with the ten percent (10%) investment limitation using the conversion, exercise, or exchange price to acquire the underlying securities at that later time without aggregating such price with the price of the overlying warrants or convertible securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The issuer may rely on a representation of the purchaser when determining compliance with the ten percent (10%) investment limitation in this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C), provided that the issuer does not know at the time of sale that any such representation is untrue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In a transaction that represents a sale by the issuer or an underwriter, or a sale by a dealer within 90 calendar days after qualification of the offering statement, each underwriter or dealer selling in such transaction must deliver to each purchaser from it, not later than two business days following the completion of such sale, a copy of the Final Offering Circular, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the sale was by the issuer and was not effected by or through an underwriter or dealer, the issuer is responsible for delivering the Final Offering Circular as if the issuer were an underwriter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For continuous or delayed offerings pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the 90 calendar day period for dealers shall commence on the day of the first bona fide offering of securities under such offering statement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the security is listed on a registered national securities exchange, no offering circular need be delivered by a dealer more than 25 calendar days after the later of the qualification date of the offering statement or the first date on which the security was bona fide offered to the public;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> No offering circular need be delivered by a dealer if the issuer is subject, immediately prior to the time of the filing of the offering statement, to the reporting requirements of Rule 257(b) (Sec.  230.257(b)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The Final Offering Circular delivery requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section may be satisfied by delivering a notice to the effect that the sale was made pursuant to a qualified offering statement that includes the uniform resource locator (``URL''), which, in the case of an electronic-only offering, must be an active hyperlink, where the Final Offering Circular, or the offering statement of which such Final Offering Circular is part, may be obtained on the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') and contact information sufficient to notify a purchaser where a request for a Final Offering Circular can be sent and received in response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continuous or delayed offerings. (i) Continuous or delayed offerings may be made under this Regulation A, so long as the offering statement pertains only to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Securities that are to be offered or sold solely by or on behalf of a person or persons other than the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or a person of which the issuer is a subsidiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Securities that are to be offered and sold pursuant to a dividend or interest reinvestment plan or an employee benefit plan of the issuer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Securities that are to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, or rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Securities that are to be issued upon conversion of other outstanding securities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Securities that are pledged as collateral; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Securities the offering of which will be commenced within two calendar days after the qualification date, will be made on a continuous basis, may continue for a period in excess of 30 calendar days from the date of initial qualification, and will be offered in an amount that, at the time the offering statement is qualified, is reasonably expected to be offered and sold within two years from the initial qualification date. These securities may be offered and sold only if not more than three years have elapsed since the initial qualification date of the offering statement under which they are being offered and sold; provided, however, that if a new offering statement has been filed pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F), securities covered by the prior offering statement may continue to be offered and sold until the earlier of the qualification date of the new offering statement or 180 calendar days after the third anniversary of the initial qualification date of the prior offering statement. Before the end of such three-year period, an issuer may file a new offering statement covering the securities. The new offering statement must include all the information that would be required at that time in an offering statement relating to all offerings that it covers. Before the qualification date of the new offering statement, the issuer may include as part of such new offering statement any unsold securities covered by the earlier offering statement by identifying on the cover page of the new offering circular, or the latest amendment, the amount of such unsold securities being included. The offering of securities on the earlier offering statement will be deemed terminated as of the date of qualification of the new offering statement. Securities may be sold pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F) only if the issuer is current in its annual and semiannual filings pursuant to Rule 257(b) (Sec.  230.257(b)), at the time of such sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the market offerings, by or on behalf of the issuer or otherwise, are not permitted under this Regulation A.

A request for confidential treatment may be made under Rule 406 (Sec.  230.406) for information required to be filed, and Rule 83 (Sec.  200.83) for information not required to be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Electronic filing. Documents filed or otherwise provided to the Commission pursuant to this Regulation A must be submitted in electronic format by means of EDGAR in accordance with the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 CFR part 232).
