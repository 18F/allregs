The sum of all cash and other consideration to be received for the securities (``aggregate offering price'') shall not exceed $5,000,000, including no more than $1,500,000 offered by all selling security holders, less the aggregate offering price for all securities sold within the twelve months before the start of and during the offering of securities in reliance upon Regulation A.

Any portion of the aggregate offering price attributable to cash received in a foreign currency shall be translated into United States currency at a currency exchange rate in effect on or at a reasonable time prior to the date of the sale of the securities. If securities are not offered for cash, the aggregate offering price shall be based on the value of the consideration as established by bona fide sales of that consideration made within a reasonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair value as determined by an accepted standard. Valuations of non-cash consideration must be reasonable at the time made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Integration with other offerings.

See Securities Act Release No. 4552 (November 6, 1962) [27 FR 11316].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Offering conditions--(1) Offers.
