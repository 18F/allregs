                                Sec. 2634.310  Trusts, estates, and investment funds.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each financial disclosure report shall include the information required by this subpart about the holdings of and income from the holdings of any trust, estate, investment fund or other financial arrangement from which income is received by, or with respect to which a beneficial interest in principal or income is held by, the filer, his spouse, or dependent child.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section, each financial disclosure report shall include the information required by this subpart about the holdings of and income from the holdings of any trust, estate, investment fund or other financial arrangement from which income is received by, or with respect to which a beneficial interest in principal or income is held by, the filer, his spouse, or dependent child.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No information, however, is required about a nonvested beneficial interest in the principal or income of an estate or trust. A vested interest is a present right or title to property, which carries with it an existing right of alienation, even though the right to possession or enjoyment may be postponed to some uncertain time in the future. This includes a future interest when one has a right, defeasible or indefeasible, to the immediate possession or enjoyment of the property, upon the ceasing of another's interest. Accordingly, it is not the uncertainty of the time of enjoyment in the future, but the uncertainty of the right of enjoyment (title and alienation), which differentiates a ``vested'' and a ``nonvested'' interest.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth3">Nothing in this section requires the reporting of the holdings or income of a revocable inter vivos trust (also known as a ``living trust'') with respect to which the filer, his spouse or dependent child has only a remainder interest, whether or not vested, provided that the grantor of the trust is neither the filer, the filer's spouse, nor the filer's dependent child. Furthermore, nothing in this section requires the reporting of the holdings or income of a revocable inter vivos trust from which the filer, his spouse or dependent child receives any discretionary distribution, provided that the grantor of the trust is neither the filer, the filer's spouse, nor the filer's dependent child.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified trusts and excepted trusts. (1) A filer should not report information about the holdings of or income from holdings of, any qualified blind trust (as defined in Sec. 2634.402) or any qualified diversified trust (as defined in Sec. 2634.402). For a qualified blind trust, a public financial disclosure report shall disclose the category of the aggregate amount of the trust's income attributable to the beneficial interest of the filer, his spouse, or dependent child in the trust. For a qualified diversified trust, a public financial disclosure report shall disclose the category of the aggregate amount of income with respect to such a trust which is actually received by the filer, his spouse, or dependent child, or applied for the benefit of any of them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A filer should not report information about the holdings of or income from holdings of, any qualified blind trust (as defined in Sec. 2634.402) or any qualified diversified trust (as defined in Sec. 2634.402). For a qualified blind trust, a public financial disclosure report shall disclose the category of the aggregate amount of the trust's income attributable to the beneficial interest of the filer, his spouse, or dependent child in the trust. For a qualified diversified trust, a public financial disclosure report shall disclose the category of the aggregate amount of income with respect to such a trust which is actually received by the filer, his spouse, or dependent child, or applied for the benefit of any of them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an excepted trust, a filer should indicate the general nature of its holdings, to the extent known, but will not otherwise need to report information about the trust's holdings or income from holdings. The category of the aggregate amount of income from an excepted trust which is received by or accrued to the benefit of the filer, his spouse, or dependent child shall be reported on public financial disclosure reports. For purposes of this part, the term ``excepted trust'' means a trust:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Which was not created directly by the filer, spouse, or dependent child; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The holdings or sources of income of which the filer, spouse, or dependent child have no specific knowledge through a report, disclosure, or constructive receipt, whether intended or inadvertent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Excepted investment funds. (1) No information is required under paragraph (a) of this section about the underlying holdings of or income from underlying holdings of an excepted investment fund as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that the fund itself shall be identified as an interest in property and/or a source of income. Filers must also disclose the category of value of the fund interest held; aggregate amount of income from the fund which is received by or accrued to the benefit of the filer, his spouse, or dependent child; and value of any transactions involving shares or units of the fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No information is required under paragraph (a) of this section about the underlying holdings of or income from underlying holdings of an excepted investment fund as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that the fund itself shall be identified as an interest in property and/or a source of income. Filers must also disclose the category of value of the fund interest held; aggregate amount of income from the fund which is received by or accrued to the benefit of the filer, his spouse, or dependent child; and value of any transactions involving shares or units of the fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of financial disclosure reports filed under the provisions of this part, an ``excepted investment fund'' means a widely held investment fund (whether a mutual fund, regulated investment company, common trust fund maintained by a bank or similar financial institution, pension or deferred compensation plan, or any other investment fund), if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> The fund is publicly traded or available; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The fund is publicly traded or available; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The assets of the fund are widely diversified; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The filer neither exercises control over nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held by the fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A fund is widely diversified if it holds no more than 5% of the value of its portfolio in the securities of any one issuer (other than the United

States Government) and no more than 20% in any particular economic or geographic sector.
