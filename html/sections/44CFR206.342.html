                            <p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the definitions set  forth in part 206 of subchapter D are applicable to this subject.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consultation means that process by which FEMA informs the  Secretary of the Interior through his/her designated agent of FEMA  proposed disaster assistance actions on a designated unit of the Coastal  Barrier Resources System and by which the Secretary makes comments to  FEMA   about the appropriateness of that action. Approval by the Secretary is  not required in order that an action be carried out.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Essential link means that portion of a road, utility, or other  facility originating outside of the system unit but providing access or  service through the unit and for which no alternative route is  reasonably available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Existing facility on a unit of CBRS established by Public Law  97-348 means a publicly owned or operated facility on which the start of  a construction took place prior to October 18, 1982, and for which this  fact can be adequately documented. In addition, a legally valid building  permit or equivalent documentation, if required, must have been obtained  for the construction prior to October 18, 1982. If a facility has been  substantially improved or expanded since October 18, 1982, it is not an  existing facility. For any other unit added to the CBRS by amendment to  Public Law 97-348, the enactment date of such amendment is substituted  for October 18, 1982, in this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expansion means changing a facility to increase its capacity or  size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Facility means ``public facility'' as defined in Sec. 206.201.  This includes any publicly owned flood control, navigation, irrigation,  reclamation, public power, sewage treatment and collection, water supply  and distribution, watershed development, or airport facility; and  nonfederal-aid street, road, or highway; and any other public building,  structure, or system, including those used for educational,  recreational, or cultural purposes, or any park.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Financial assistance means any form of Federal loan, grant  guaranty, insurance, payment rebate, subsidy or any other form of direct  or indirect Federal assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> New financial assistance on a unit of the CBRS established by  Public Law 97-348 means an approval by FEMA of a project application or  other disaster assistance after October 18, 1982. For any other unit  added to the CBRS by amendment to Public Law 97-348, the enactment date  such amendment is substituted for October 18, 1982, in this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Start of construction for a structure means the first placement  of permanent construction, such as the placement of footings or slabs or  any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction for a  structure does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading,  and placement of fill, nor does it include excavation for a basement,  footings, or piers. For a facility which is not a structure, start of  construction means the first activity for permanent construction of a  substantial part of the facility. Permanent construction for a facility  does not include land preparation such as clearing and grubbing but  would include excavation and placement of fill such as for a road.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or  liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a  mobile home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or  other improvement of a structure or facility, that has been damaged in  excess of, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50 percent of the  market value of the structure or placement cost of the facility  (including all ``public facilities'') as defined in the Stafford Act)  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the repair or improvement is started; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the structure or facility has been damaged and is proposed to  be restored, before the damage occurred. If a facility is a link in a  larger system, the percentage of damage will be based on the relative  cost of repairing the damaged facility to the replacement cost of that  portion of the system which is operationally dependent on the facility.  The term substantial improvement does not include any alternation of a  structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places  or a State Inventory of Historic Places.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> System unit means any undeveloped coastal barrier, or  combination of closely related undeveloped coastal barriers included  within the Coastal Barrier Resources System as established by the  section 4 of the CBRA, or as modified by the Secretary in accordance  with that statute.</p>
