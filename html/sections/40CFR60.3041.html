Make sure the averages for carbon  monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen. Use  the 1-hour averages of oxygen data from your continuous emission  monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen level and to calculate  emissions at 7 percent oxygen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a  valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your  continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of  operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the  operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating days  per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any  municipal or institutional solid waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a)  through (c) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection  requirement regardless of the emission level monitored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a)  through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the  continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission  concentrations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If continuous emission monitoring systems are temporarily  unavailable to meet the data collection requirements, refer to table 4  of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when  systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and  span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.</p>
