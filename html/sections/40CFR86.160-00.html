                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> for a discussion of simulation procedure approvals).  The environmental test facility must be capable of providing the  following nominal ambient test conditions of: 95 F air temperature, 100  grains of water/pound of dry air (approximately 40 percent relative  humidity), a solar heat load intensity of 850 W/m\2\, and vehicle  cooling air flow proportional to vehicle speed. Section 86.161-00  discusses the minimum facility requirements and corresponding control  tolerances for air conditioning ambient test conditions. The vehicle's  air conditioner is operated or appropriately simulated for the duration  of the test procedure (except for the vehicle 10 minute soak), including  the preconditioning. For gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the  composite samples collected in bags are analyzed for THC, CO,  CO2, CH4, and NOX. For petroleum-fueled  diesel-cycle vehicles, THC is sampled and analyzed continuously  according to the provisions of Sec. 86.110. Parallel bag samples of  dilution air are analyzed for THC, CO, CO2, CH4,  and NOX.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Dynamometer activities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All official air conditioning tests  shall be run on a large single roll electric dynamometer or an  equivalent dynamometer configuration that satisfies the requirements of  Sec. 86.108-00.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Position (vehicle can be driven) the test vehicle on the  dynamometer and restrain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Required SC03 schedule test dynamometer inertia weight class  selections are determined by the test vehicles test weight basis and  corresponding equivalent weight as listed in the tabular information of  Sec. 86.129-00(a) and discussed in Sec. 86.129-00 (e) and (f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Set the dynamometer test inertia weight and roadload horsepower  requirements for the test vehicle (see Sec. 86.129-00 (e) and (f)). The  dynamometer's horsepower adjustment settings shall be set such that the  force imposed during dynamometer operation matches actual road load  force at all speeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The vehicle speed as measured from the dynamometer rolls shall  be used. A speed vs. time recording, as evidence of dynamometer test  validity, shall be supplied at request of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The drive wheel tires may be inflated up to a gauge pressure of  45 psi (310 kPa), or the manufacturer's recommended pressure if higher  than 45 psi, in order to prevent tire damage. The drive wheel tire  pressure shall be reported with the test results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The driving distance, as measured by counting the number of  dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions, shall be determined for the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles may be tested  either in a four-wheel drive or a two-wheel drive mode of operation. In  order to test in   the two-wheel drive mode, four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles  may have one set of drive wheels disengaged; four-wheel and all-wheel  drive vehicles which can be shifted to a two-wheel mode by the driver  may be tested in a two-wheel drive mode of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vehicle and test activities for testing in a full environmental  cell. The SFTP air conditioning test in an environmental test cell is  composed of the following sequence of activities. Alternative procedures  which appropriately simulate full environmental cell testing may be  approved under the provisions of Secs. 86.162-00(a) and 86.163-00.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Drain and fill the vehicle's fuel tank to 40 percent capacity  with test fuel. If a vehicle has gone through the drain and fuel  sequence less than 72 hours previously and has remained under laboratory  ambient temperature conditions, this drain and fill operation can be  omitted (see Sec. 86.132-00(c)(2)(ii)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Position the variable speed cooling fan in front of the test  vehicle with the vehicle's hood down. This air flow should provide  representative cooling at the front of the test vehicle (air  conditioning condenser and engine) during the SC03 driving schedule. See  Sec. 86.161-00(e) for a discussion of cooling fan specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of vehicles with rear engine compartments (or if  this front location provides inadequate engine cooling), an additional  cooling fan shall be placed in a position to provide sufficient air to  maintain vehicle cooling. The fan capacity shall normally not exceed  5300 cfm (2.50 m\3\/s). If, however, it can be demonstrated that during  road operation the vehicle receives additional cooling, and that such  additional cooling is needed to provide a representative test, the fan  capacity may be increased or additional fans used if approved in advance  by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Close all vehicle windows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Connect the emission test sampling system to the vehicle's  exhaust tail pipe(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Set the environmental test cell ambient test conditions to  the conditions defined in Sec. 86.161-00.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Turn on the solar heating system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All vehicle test phases of preconditioning, soak, and the  official SC03 test cycle are to be performed in this set of ambient test  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Set the air conditioning system controls as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A/C mode setting at Maximum.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Airflow setting at Recirculate, if so equipped.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fan setting at Highest setting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A/C Temperature setting at full cool (for automatic systems set  at 72 F).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Air conditioning controls should be placed in the ``on''  position prior to vehicle starting so that the air conditioning system  is active whenever the engine is running.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Start the vehicle (with air conditioning system on) and conduct  a preconditioning cycle as discussed in Sec. 86.132-00(o)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If engine stalling should occur during any air conditioning test  cycle operation, follow the provisions of Sec. 86.136-90 (Engine  starting and restarting).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For manual transmission vehicles, the vehicle shall be shifted  according the provisions of Sec. 86.128-00.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Following the preconditioning cycle, the test vehicle (and  consequently the air conditioning system) and cooling fan(s) are turned  off and the vehicle is allowed to soak in the ambient conditions of  paragraph (c)(5) of this section for 10 [1 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Start engine (with air conditioning system also running).  Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place vehicle in gear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Eighteen seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial  vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Operate the vehicle according to the SC03 driving schedule, as  described in appendix I, paragraph (h), of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last  deceleration (i.e., engine off at 596 seconds).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exhaust Emission Measurement Activities. The following  activities are performed, when applicable, in order to meet the timing  of the vehicle test and environmental facility activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform the test bench sampling calibration sequence outlined in  Sec. 86.140-94 prior to or in conjunction   with each series of exhaust emission measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the sample selector valves in the ``standby'' position,  connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust and  dilution air sample collection systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps, the  temperature recorder, the vehicle cooling fan, and the heated THC  analysis recorder (diesel-cycle only). The heat exchanger of the  constant volume sampler, if used, petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle THC  analyzer continuous sample line should be preheated to their respective  operating temperatures before the test begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set  the gas flow measuring devices to zero.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For gaseous bag samples (except THC samples), the minimum flow  rate is 0.17 cfm (0.08 liters/sec).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For THC samples, the minimum FID (or HFID in the case of  diesel-cycle vehicles) flow rate is 0.066 cfm (0.031 1/sec).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CFV sample flow rate is fixed by the venturi design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Attach the exhaust tube to the vehicle tailpipe(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Start the gas flow measuring device, position the sample  selector valves to direct the sample flow into the exhaust sample bag,  the dilution air sample bag, turn on the petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle  THC analyzer system integrator, mark the recorder chart, and record both  gas meter or flow measurement instrument readings, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Start the engine (with air conditioning system also running).  Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place vehicle in gear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial  vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Operate the vehicle according to the SC03 driving schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Turn the engine off 2 seconds after the end of the last  deceleration (i.e., engine off at 596 seconds).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Five seconds after the engine stops running, simultaneously  turn off gas flow measuring device No. 1 (and the petroleum-fueled  diesel hydrocarbon integrator No. 1 and mark the petroleum-fueled diesel  hydrocarbon recorder chart if applicable) and position the sample  selector valves to the ``standby'' position. Record the measured roll or  shaft revolutions and the No. 1 gas meter reading or flow measurement  instrument).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> As soon as possible, transfer the exhaust and dilution air bag  samples to the analytical system and process the samples according to  Sec. 86.140 obtaining a stabilized reading of the bag exhaust sample on  all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection  phase of the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Immediately after the end of the sample period, turn off the  cooling fan, disconnect the exhaust tube from the vehicle tailpipe(s),  and drive the vehicle from dynamometer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The CVS or CFV may be turned off, if desired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NOX humidity correction.
