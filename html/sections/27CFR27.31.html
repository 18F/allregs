                            <p class="depth0">The sale of warehouse receipts for distilled spirits is equivalent  to the sale of distilled spirits. Accordingly, every person engaged in  business as an importer of distilled spirits who sells, or offers for  sale, warehouse receipts for distilled spirits stored in customs bonded  warehouses, or elsewhere, must register and keep records as a dealer in  liquors at the place where the warehouse receipts are sold or offered  for sale, in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
