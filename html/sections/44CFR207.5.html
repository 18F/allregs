                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section describes how FEMA determines the amount of funds that it will contribute under this part for management costs for PA and/or HMGP for a particular major disaster or emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lock-in. FEMA will determine the amount of funds that it will make available for management costs by a lock-in, which will act as a ceiling for funds available to a grantee, including its subgrantees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not earlier than 30 days and not later than 35 days from the date of declaration, FEMA will provide the grantee preliminary lock-in amount(s) for management costs based on the projections at that time of the Federal share for financial assistance for PA and HMGP, as applicable. In accordance with Sec. 207.7(c), FEMA will obligate 25 percent of the estimated lock-in amount(s) to the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For planning purposes, FEMA will revise the lock-in amount(s) at 6

months after the date of the declaration. In accordance with Sec. 207.7(e), FEMA may obligate interim amount(s) to the grantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FEMA will determine the final lock-in amount(s) 12 months after date of declaration or after determination of the final HMGP lock-in ceiling, whichever is later. FEMA will obligate the remainder of the lock-in amount(s) to the grantee in accordance with Sec. 207.7(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rates. (i) For major disaster declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for PA based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs for financial assistance pursuant to sections 403, 406, and 407 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170b, 5172, and 5173, respectively, but not including direct Federal assistance. For major disaster declarations on or after November 13, 2007, the PA rate will be 3.34 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For major disaster declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for PA based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs for financial assistance pursuant to sections 403, 406, and 407 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170b, 5172, and 5173, respectively, but not including direct Federal assistance. For major disaster declarations on or after November 13, 2007, the PA rate will be 3.34 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For major disaster declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for HMGP based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs under section 404 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170c. For major disaster declarations on or after November 13, 2007, the HMGP rate will be 4.89 percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For emergency declarations, FEMA will determine the lock-in for PA based on a flat percentage rate of the Federal share of projected eligible program costs for financial assistance (sections 502 and 503 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5192 and 5193, respectively), but not including direct Federal assistance. For emergency declarations on or after November 13, 2007 the rate will be 3.90 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The dollar amount provided to a grantee for management cost funds for a single declaration will not exceed 20,000,000, except as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grantee must justify in writing to the Regional Administrator any requests to change the amount of the lock-in or the cap, extend the time period before lock-in, or request an interim obligation of funding at the time of the 6-month lock-in adjustment. The Regional Administrator will recommend to the Chief Financial Officer whether to approve the extension, change, or interim obligation. Extensions, changes to the lock-in, or interim obligations will not be made without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Chief Financial Officer may change the amount of the lock-in or the cap, or extend the time before lock-in, if the Chief Financial Officer determines that the projections used to determine the lock-in were inaccurate to such a degree that the change to the lock-in would be material, or for other reasons in his or her discretion that may reasonably warrant such changes. The Chief Financial Officer will not make such changes without consultation with the grantee and the Regional Administrator.</p>
