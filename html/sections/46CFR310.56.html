                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Physical standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A candidate shall meet the physical  requirements prescribed by the Department of the Navy for appointment as  Midshipman, USNR (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, USNR) and the  requirements prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard for original licensing  as a third mate and third assistant engineer. All candidates shall have  color perception and refractive error within the limits prescribed by  the Department of the Navy or by the U.S. Coast Guard, whichever are  higher.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement to meet these standards is a continuing one and  shall apply through graduation from the Academy. Failure to meet the  standards while attending the Academy is grounds for, and may lead to  disenrollment. Individuals who have completed at least two years of  study and, as a result of an accident, illness or other cause (during  official duty), fail to meet this requirement may be permitted to remain  at the Academy at the discretion of, and under conditions set by, the  Administrator. Those individuals permitted to remain through graduation  will agree to fulfill aspects of the service obligation which they are  capable of, as deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying physical examinations. All candidates for the Academy  shall have a physical and dental examination conducted by a service  academy   examining facility designated by the Service Academies Central Medical  Review Board. The required physical examination shall occur within 1  year preceding the date of admission to the Academy. Although there is  no charge for such examination, all expenses (including travel, meals  and hotel accommodations) incurred in obtaining such examination shall  be borne by the applicant. Candidates may be subject to reexamination  upon reporting to the Academy and at any time while attending the  Academy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Physical reexamination. A candidate who is rejected for failure  to meet the physical requirements may request either a reevaluation of  the examination results or a reexamination. A midshipman failing to meet  the physical requirements while attending the Academy is entitled to  make the same request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waivers. Some medical requirements may be waived for enrolled  students and applicants to the USMMA who require such a medical waiver  to qualify for admission and/or retention. Since commissioning in the  United States Navy, or any other branch of the Armed Forces, is a  requirement for graduation, no waivers will be granted for medical  conditions which would prevent commissioning in at least a restricted  status in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Individuals interested in waiver  consideration may request a waiver by writing to the Superintendent,  USMMA. The granting of medical waivers will be based on U.S. Navy  guidelines and regulations for waiver consideration for admission to the  U.S. Naval Academy and the physical requirements consistent with  commissioning as a reserve officer in the U.S. Navy in a restricted line  program. Individuals requesting medical waivers must be able to meet all  other admission requirements, including the physical examination  requirement for an original U.S. Coast Guard merchant marine license as  a third mate and/or third assistant engineer. The decision of the  Superintendent on any requested waiver is administratively final.  [47 FR 21812, May 20, 1982, as amended at 55 FR 46952, Nov. 8, 1990]</p>
