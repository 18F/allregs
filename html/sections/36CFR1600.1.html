                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains the rules that the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation (the Foundation) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, which are processed under subpart B of this part, are processed under this subpart also. Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular Foundation activity (for example, press releases, annual reports, informational brochures and the like) may be provided to the public without following this subpart. As a matter of policy, the Foundation makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart applies to all Foundation programs, including the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (USIECR).</p>
