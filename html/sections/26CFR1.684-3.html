                                Sec. 1.684-3  Exceptions to general rule of gain recognition.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Transfers to grantor trusts. The general rule of gain  recognition under Sec. 1.684-1 shall not apply to any transfer of  property by a U.S. person to a foreign trust to the extent that any  person is treated as the owner of the trust under section 671. Section  1.684-2(e)   provides rules regarding a subsequent change in the status of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transfers to charitable trusts. The general rule of gain  recognition under Sec. 1.684-1 shall not apply to any transfer of  property to a foreign trust that is described in section 501(c)(3)  (without regard to the requirements of section 508(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certain transfers at death. The general rule of gain recognition  under Sec. 1.684-1 shall not apply to any transfer of property by  reason of death of the U.S. transferor if the basis of the property in  the hands of the foreign trust is determined under section 1014(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transfers for fair market value to unrelated trusts. The general  rule of gain recognition under Sec. 1.684-1 shall not apply to any  transfer of property for fair market value to a foreign trust that is  not a related foreign trust as defined in Sec. 1.679-1(c)(5). Section  1.671-2(e)(2)(ii) defines fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transfers to which section 1032 applies. The general rule of  gain recognition under Sec. 1.684-1 shall not apply to any transfer of  stock (including treasury stock) by a domestic corporation to a foreign  trust if the domestic corporation is not required to recognize gain on  the transfer under section 1032.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain distributions to trusts. For purposes of this section, a  transfer does not include a distribution to a trust with respect to an  interest held by such trust in an entity other than a trust or an  interest in certain investment trusts described in Sec. 301.7701-4(c)  of this chapter, liquidating trusts described in Sec. 301.7701-4(d) of  this chapter, or environmental remediation trusts described in Sec.  301.7701-4(e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section. In all examples, A is a U.S. citizen and FT is a foreign trust.  The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Transfer to owner trust. In 2001, A transfers property  which has a fair market value of 1000X and an adjusted basis equal to  400X to FT. At the time of the transfer, FT has a U.S. beneficiary  within the meaning of Sec. 1.679-2, and A is treated as owning FT under  section 679. Under paragraph (a) of this section, Sec. 1.684-1 does not  cause A to recognize gain at the time of the transfer. See Sec. 1.684- 2(e) for rules that may require A to recognize gain if the trust is no  longer owned by A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Transfer of property at death: Basis determined under  section 1014(a). (i) The initial facts are the same as Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A dies on July 1, 2004. The fair market value at A's death of  all property transferred to FT by A is 1500X. The basis in the property  is 400X. A retained the power to revoke FT, thus, the value of all  property owned by FT at A's death is includible in A's gross estate for  U.S. estate tax purposes. Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, A  is not required to recognize gain under Sec. 1.684-1 because the basis  of the property in the hands of the foreign trust is determined under  section 1014(a).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Transfer of property at death: Basis not determined under  section 1014(a). (i) The initial facts are the same as Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A dies on July 1, 2004. The fair market value at A's death of  all property transferred to FT by A is 1500X. The basis in the property  is 400X. A retains no power over FT, and FT's basis in the property  transferred is not determined under section 1014(a). Under Sec. 1.684- 2(e)(1), A is treated as having transferred the property to FT  immediately before his death, and must recognize 1100X of gain at that  time under Sec. 1.684-1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Transfer of property for fair market value to an  unrelated foreign trust. A sells a house with a fair market value of  1000X to FT in exchange for a 30-year note issued by FT. A is not  related to FT as defined in Sec. 1.679-1(c)(5). FT is not treated as  owned by any person. Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, A is not  required to recognize gain under Sec. 1.684-1.  [T.D. 8956, 66 FR 37899, July 20, 2001]</p>
