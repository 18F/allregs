Correspondence about prices, package size or shape, or other matters that could not possibly reveal the existence of a hazard to health shall not, for compliance purposes, be considered a complaint and therefore need not be made available to a Food and Drug Administration investigator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a complaint shows that a hazard to health possibly exists, the manufacturer shall conduct an investigation into the validity of the complaint. Where such an investigation is conducted, the manufacturer shall include in its file on the complaint the determination as to whether a hazard to health exists and the basis for that determination. No investigation is necessary when the manufacturer determines that there is no possibility of a hazard to health. When no investigation is necessary, the manufacturer shall include in the record the reason that an investigation was found to be unnecessary and the name of the responsible person making that determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the consumption of an infant formula and an infant's death, the manufacturer shall, within 15 days of receiving such information, conduct an investigation and notify the Agency as required in Sec. 106.150.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The manufacturer shall maintain in designated files all records pertaining to the complaints it receives.

When the manufacturer wishes to maintain all consumer complaints for the entire firm at one location other than at the facility where an infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed, the manufacturer may do so as long as all records required by this section are available within 24 hours of request for inspection at that facility. However, all records of consumer complaints, including summaries, any reports, and any files, maintained at the manufacturing facility or at any other facility shall be made available to investigators for review and copying upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The manufacturer shall make readily available for authorized inspection all records required under this part or copies of such records. Records shall be available at any reasonable time at the establishment where the activities described in such records occurred. (Infant formula complaint files may be maintained at one facility, as provided in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, if all required records are readily available at that facility.) These records or copies thereof shall be subject to photocopying or other means of reproduction as part of such inspection. Records that can be immediately retrieved from another location by electronic means shall be considered as meeting the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A manufacturer shall maintain all records required under this part in a manner that ensures that both the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration can be provided with access to such records within 24 hours. The manufacturer may maintain the records required under this part as original records, as true copies such as photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records, or as electronic records. Where reduction techniques, such as microfilming, are used, suitable reader and photocopying equipment shall be readily available. All electronic records maintained under this part shall comply with part 11 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Production control, product testing, testing results, complaints, and distribution records necessary to verify compliance with parts 106, 107, 109, 110, 113, and 117 of this chapter, or with other appropriate regulations, shall be retained for 1 year after the expiration of the shelf life of the infant formula or 3 years from the date of manufacture, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The manufacturer shall maintain quality control records that contain sufficient information to permit a public health evaluation of any production aggregate of infant formula.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> A manufacturer shall make and retain records that demonstrate that the formula meets the quality factor of normal physical growth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an infant formula that is not an eligible infant formula, in accordance with Sec. 106.96(d), these records shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Records demonstrating compliance with the requirements in Sec. 106.96(b), including records made in compliance with Sec. 106.121; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Records demonstrating satisfaction of an applicable exemption under Sec. 106.96(c), including records made in compliance with Sec. 106.121.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an eligible infant formula, in accordance with Sec. 106.96(i)(5), these records shall include records demonstrating that the formula fulfills one or more of the criteria listed in Sec. 106.96(i)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> A manufacturer shall make and retain records that demonstrate that a formula meets the quality factor of sufficient biological quality of protein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an infant formula that is not an eligible infant formula, in accordance with Sec. 106.96(h), these records shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Records demonstrating compliance with the requirements in Sec. 106.96(f), including records made in compliance with Sec. 106.121; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Records demonstrating satisfaction of an applicable exemption under Sec. 106.96(g), including records made in compliance with Sec. 106.121.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an eligible infant formula, in accordance with Sec. 106.96(i)(5), these records shall include records demonstrating that the formula fulfills one or more of the criteria listed in Sec. 106.96(i)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> The failure to comply with the records requirements in this section applicable to the quality factors shall render the formula adulterated under section 412(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The failure to comply with the records requirements in this section applicable to the good manufacturing practices and quality control procedures, including distribution and audit records requirements, with respect to an infant formula shall render the formula adulterated under section 412(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A failure to retain or make available records applicable to the quality factor requirements, quality control procedures, or current good manufacturing practices requirements in compliance with paragraph (l), (m), or (n) of this section with respect to a formula shall render the formula adulterated under section 412(a)(2) or (a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable.
