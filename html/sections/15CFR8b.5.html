                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assurances. An applicant for Federal financial assistance to  which this part applies shall submit an assurance, on a form specified  by the Secretary, that the program or activity will be operated in  compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances  by reference in subsequent applications to the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of obligation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of Federal financial  assistance extended in the form of real property or structures on the  property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a  subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the  real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal  financial assistance is extended, or for another purpose involving the  provision of similar services or benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide  personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the  period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In all other cases, the assurance will obligate the recipient  for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended or  the federally-funded program or activity is operated, whichever is  longer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Covenants. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where Federal financial assistance is provided in  the form of real property or interest in the property from the  Department, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall  contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for  the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for  which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another  purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where no transfer or property is involved but property is  purchased or   improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to  include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in  the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transferee of the  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of  real property or interest in the property from the Department, the  covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be  reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event  of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposed  to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security to  finance construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on  the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred,  the Secretary may agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert  title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance  remains effective. Such an agreement by the Secretary may be entered  into only upon the request of the transferee (recipient) if it is  necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such terms and  conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interagency agreements. Where funds are granted by the  Department to another Federal agency to carry out the objectives of  Federal financial assistance under a law administered by the Department,  and where the grant obligates the recipient agency to comply with the  rules and regulations of the Department applicable to that grant the  provisions of this part shall apply to programs or activities operated  with such funds.</p>
