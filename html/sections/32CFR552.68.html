Generally, this is within the 5 years preceding the date of  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General agents and agents will represent only one accredited  commercial insurance company. The overseas commander may waive this  requirement if multiple representation can be proven to be in the best  interest of DOD personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An agent must possess a current State license. The overseas  commander may waive this requirement on behalf of an accredited agent  who has been continuously residing and successfully selling life  insurance in foreign areas and forfeits his eligibility for a State  license, through no fault of his own, due to the operation of State law  or regulation governing domicile requirements, or requiring that the  agent's company be licensed to do business in that State. The request  for a waiver will contain the name of the State and jurisdiction, which  would not renew the agent's license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An agent, once accredited in an overseas area, may not change  his affiliation from the staff of one general agent to another, unless  the losing company certifies, in writing, that the release is without  justifiable prejudice. Unified commanders will have final authority to  determine justifiable prejudice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where the accredited insurer's policy permits, an overseas  accredited life insurance agent, if duly qualified to engage in security  activities either as a registered representative of a member of the  National Association of Securities Dealers or an associated person of a  broker/dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission  only, may offer life insurance and securities for sale simultaneously.  In cases of commingled sales, the allotment of pay for the purchase of  securities cannot be made to the insurer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Overseas commanders will exercise further agent control  procedures as necessary.</p>
