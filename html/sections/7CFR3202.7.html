                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who may use the certification mark?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers and vendors. Only manufacturers and vendors who  have received a notice of certification, or designated representatives  of the manufacturer or vendor, may affix the official certification mark  (in one of the   three variations, as applicable) to the product or its packaging. A  manufacturer or vendor who has received a notice of certification for a  product under this part:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May use the certification mark on the product, its packaging,  and other related materials including, but not limited to,  advertisements, catalogs, specification sheets, procurement databases,  promotional material, Web sites, or user manuals for that product,  according to the requirements set forth in this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is responsible for the manner in which the mark is used by its  companies, as well as its designated representatives, including  advertising agencies, marketing and public relations firms and  subcontractors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other entities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Other entities may use the mark to advertise  or promote certified biobased products in materials including, but not  limited to, advertisements, catalogs, procurement databases, Web sites,  and promotional and educational materials, as long as the manufacturer  or vendor of the product, or one of their designated representatives,  has affixed the mark to the product or its packaging.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other entities may use the certification mark; the phrase  ``USDA Certified Biobased Product/Package/Product & Package,'' as  applicable; and the BioPreferred Program name in general statements as  described in paragraph (b) of this section, as long as the statements do  not imply that a non-certified biobased product is certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Correct usage of the certification mark. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certification  mark can be affixed only to certified biobased products and their  associated packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification mark may be used in material including, but  not limited to, advertisements, catalogs, procurement databases, Web  sites, and promotional and educational materials to distinguish products  that are certified for use of the label from those that are not  certified. The certification mark may be used in advertisements for both  certified biobased products and non-certified/labeled products if the  advertisement clearly indicates which products are certified/labeled.  Care must be taken to avoid implying that any non-certified products are  certified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The certification mark may be used without reference to a  specific certified biobased product only when informing the public about  the purpose of the certification mark. For example, the following or  similar claim is acceptable: ``Look for the `USDA Certified Biobased  Product' certification mark. It means that the product meets USDA  standards for the amount of biobased content and the manufacturer or  vendor has provided relevant information on the product to be posted on  the USDA BioPreferred Program Web site.'' This exception allows  manufacturers, vendors, and other entities to use the certification mark  in documents such as corporate reports, but only in an informative  manner, not as a statement of product certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The certification mark may appear next to a picture of the  product(s) or text describing it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The certification mark must stand alone and not be incorporated  into any other certification mark or logo designs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The certification mark may be used as a watermark provided the  use does not violate any usage restrictions specified in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The text portion of the certification mark must be written in  English and may not be translated, even when the certification mark is  used outside of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Incorrect usage of the certification mark. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certification  mark shall not be used on any product that has not been certified by  USDA as a ``USDA Certified Biobased Product.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification mark shall not be used on any advertisements  or informational materials where both certified biobased products and  non-certified products are shown unless it is clear that the  certification mark applies to only the certified biobased product(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The certification mark shall not be used to imply endorsement by  USDA or the BioPreferred Program of any particular product, service, or  company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The certification mark shall not be used in any form that could  be misleading to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The certification mark shall not be used by manufacturers or  vendors of certified products in a manner disparaging to USDA or any  other government body.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The certification mark shall not be used with an altered  certification mark or incorporated into other label or logo designs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The certification mark shall not be used on business cards,  company letterhead, or company stationery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The certification mark shall not be used in, or as part of, any  company name, logo, product name, service, or Web site, except as may be  provided for in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The certification mark shall not be used in a manner that  violates any of the applicable requirements contained in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Imported products. The certification mark can be used only with  a product that is certified by USDA under this part. The certification  mark cannot be used to imply that a product meets or exceeds the  requirements of biobased programs in other countries. Products imported  for sale in the U.S. must adhere to the same guidelines as U.S.-sourced  biobased products. Any product sold in the U.S. as a ``USDA Certified  Biobased Product/Package/Product & Package'' must have received  certification from USDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(3)</em> of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> USDA Certified Biobased Product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> USDA Certified Biobased Product: Package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> USDA Certified Biobased Product & Package.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this  section, unless approval is given by USDA for an exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A multi-color version of the certification mark is preferred.  The certification mark colors to be applied will be stipulated in the  ``Marketing Guides'' document available on the USDA BioPreferred Program  Web site (http://www.biopreferred.gov).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A one-color version of the certification mark may be substituted  for the multi-color version as long as the one color used is one of the  multi-color choices reapplied without modification. Further guidance on  the one-color certification mark application will also be detailed in  the ``Marketing Guides.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A black and white version of the certification mark is  acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Placement of the certification mark. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certification mark  can appear directly on a product, its associated packaging, in user  manuals, and in other materials including, but not limited to,  advertisements, catalogs, procurement databases, and promotional and  educational materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification mark shall not be placed in a manner that is  ambiguous about which product is a certified biobased product or that  could indicate certification of a non-certified product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When used to distinguish a certified biobased product in  material including, but not limited to, advertisements, catalogs,  procurement databases, Web sites, and promotional and educational  materials, the certification mark must appear near a picture of the  product or the text describing it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If all products on a page are certified biobased products, the  certification mark may be placed anywhere on the page.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a page contains a mix of certified biobased products and  non-certified products, the certification mark shall be placed in close  proximity to the certified biobased products. An individual  certification mark near each certified biobased product may be necessary  to avoid confusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Minimum size and clear space recommendations for the  certification mark--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The certification mark may be sized to fit the  individual application as long   as the correct proportions are maintained and the certification mark  remains legible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A border of clear space must surround the certification mark and  must be of sufficient width to offset it from surrounding images and  text and to avoid confusion. If the certification mark's color is  similar to the background color of the product or packaging, the  certification mark in a contrasting (i.e., black, white) color may be  used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where to obtain copies of the certification mark artwork. The  certification mark artwork is available at the USDA BioPreferred Program  Web site http://www.biopreferred.gov.</p>
