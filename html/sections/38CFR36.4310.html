The limitations imposed herein on the amount of the final installment shall not apply in the case of any loan extended pursuant to Sec. 36.4315.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any plan of repayment on loans required to be amortized which does not provide for approximately equal periodic payments shall not be eligible unless the plan conforms with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, or is otherwise approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Every guaranteed or insured loan shall be repayable within the estimated economic life of the property securing the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, any amounts which under the terms of a loan do not become due and payable on or before the last maturity date permissible for loans of its class under the limitations contained in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 shall automatically fall due on such date.
