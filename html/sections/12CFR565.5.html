                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Schedule for filing plan--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A savings association  shall file a written capital restoration plan with the appropriate  Regional Office within 45 days of the date that the savings association  receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the savings association  is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically  undercapitalized, unless the OTS notifies the savings association in  writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. An  adequately capitalized savings association that has been required  pursuant to Sec. 565.4(c) to comply with supervisory actions as if the  savings association were undercapitalized is not required to submit a  capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional capital restoration plans. Notwithstanding paragraph  (a)(1) of this section, a savings association that has already submitted  and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved under section  38 and this part is not required to submit an additional capital  restoration plan based on a revised calculation of its capital measures  or a reclassification of the institution under Sec. 565.4(c) unless the  OTS notifies the savings association that it must submit a new or  revised capital plan. A savings association that is notified that it  must submit a new or revised capital restoration plan shall file the  plan in writing with the appropriate Regional Office within 45 days of  receiving such notice, unless the OTS notifies the savings association  in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of plan. All financial data submitted in connection  with a capital restoration plan shall be prepared in accordance with the  instructions provided on the TFR, unless the OTS instructs otherwise.  The capital restoration plan shall include all of the information  required to be filed under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act. A savings  association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan as the  result of a reclassification of the savings association pursuant to  Sec. 565.4(c) of this part shall include a description of the steps the  savings association will take   to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice. No plan shall be  accepted unless it includes any performance guarantee described in  section 38(e)(2)(C) of the FDI Act by each company that controls the  savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of capital restoration plans. Within 60 days after  receiving a capital restoration plan under this part, the OTS shall  provide written notice to the savings association of whether the plan  has been approved. The OTS may extend the time within which notice  regarding approval of a plan shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disapproval of capital plan. If a capital restoration plan is  not approved by the OTS, the savings association shall submit a revised  capital restoration plan, when directed to do so, within the time  specified by the OTS. Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration  plan has not been approved, any undercapitalized savings association (as  defined in Sec. 565.4(b)(3) of this part) shall be subject to all of  the provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly  undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable  until such time as a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted  by the savings association has been approved by the OTS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to submit a capital restoration plan. A savings  association that is undercapitalized (as defined in Sec. 565.4(b)(3) of  this part) and that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan  within the period provided in this section shall, upon the expiration of  that period, be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this  part applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to implement a capital restoration plan. Any  undercapitalized savings association that fails in any material respect  to implement a capital restoration plan shall be subject to all of the  provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly  undercapitalized institutions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Amendment of capital plan. A savings association that has filed  an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to  and approval by the OTS, amend the plan to reflect a change in  circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved,  the savings association shall implement the capital restoration plan as  approved prior to the proposed amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice to FDIC. Within 45 days of the effective date of OTS  approval of a capital restoration plan, or any amendment to a capital  restoration plan, the OTS shall provide a copy of the plan or amendment  to the FDIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Performance guarantee by companies that control a savings  association--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limitation on liability--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Amount limitation. The  aggregate liability under the guarantee provided under section 38 and  this part for all companies that control a specific savings association  that is required to submit a capital restoration plan under this part  shall be limited to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An amount equal to 5.0 percent of the savings association's  total assets at the time the savings association was notified or deemed  to have notice that the savings association was undercapitalized; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of  the savings association to the levels required for the savings  association to be classified as adequately capitalized, as those capital  measures and levels are defined at the time that the savings association  initially fails to comply with a capital restoration plan under this  part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limit on duration. The guarantee and limit of liability under  section 38 and this part shall expire after the OTS notifies the savings  association that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four  consecutive calendar quarters. The expiration or fulfillment by a  company of a guarantee of a capital restoration plan shall not limit the  liability of the company under any guarantee required or provided in  connection with any capital restoration plan filed by the same savings  association after expiration of the first guarantee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collection on guarantee. Each company that controls a given  savings association shall be jointly and severally liable for the  guarantee for such savings association as required under section 38 and  this part, and the OTS may require and collect payment of the   full amount of that guarantee from any or all of the companies issuing  the guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the FDI Act, the savings association shall, upon  submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of section 38 and  this part that are applicable to savings associations that have not  submitted an acceptable capital restoration plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to perform guarantee. Failure by any company that  controls a savings association to perform fully its guarantee of any  capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the plan  for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure, the  savings association shall be subject to the provisions of section 38 and  this part that are applicable to savings associations that have failed  in a material respect to implement a capital restoration plan.</p>
