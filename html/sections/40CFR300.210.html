                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">There are three levels of contingency plans under the national  response system: The National Contingency Plan, RCPs, and ACPs. These  plans are available for inspection at EPA regional offices or USCG  district offices. Addresses and telephone numbers for these offices may  be found in the United States Government Manual, issued annually, or in  local telephone directories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The National Contingency Plan. The purpose and objectives,  authority, and scope of the NCP are described in Sec. Sec. 300.1  through 300.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regional Contingency Plans. The RRTs, working with the states,  shall develop federal RCPs for each standard federal region, Alaska,  Oceania in the   Pacific, and the Caribbean to coordinate timely, effective response by  various federal agencies and other organizations to discharges of oil or  releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. RCPs  shall, as appropriate, include information on all useful facilities and  resources in the region, from government, commercial, academic, and  other sources. To the greatest extent possible, RCPs shall follow the  format of the NCP and be coordinated with state emergency response  plans, ACPs, which are described in Sec. 300.210(c), and Title III  local emergency response plans, which are described in Sec. 300.215.  Such coordination should be accomplished by working with the SERCs in  the region covered by the RCP. RCPs shall contain lines of demarcation  between the inland and coastal zones, as mutually agreed upon by USCG  and EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Area Contingency Plans. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under the direction of an OSC and  subject to approval by the lead agency, each Area Committee, in  consultation with the appropriate RRTs, Coast Guard DRGs, the NSFCC,  SSCs, LEPCs, and SERCs, shall develop an ACP for its designated area.  This plan, when implemented in conjunction with other provisions of the  NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case discharge under Sec.  300.324, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a  discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility  operating in or near the area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local  planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP,  the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall  provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and  compatible, to the greatest extent possible, with all appropriate  response plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially  with Title III local emergency response plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ACP shall include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the area covered by the plan, including the  areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be  damaged by a discharge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description in detail of the responsibilities of an owner or  operator and of federal, state, and local agencies in removing a  discharge, and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a  discharge;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A list of equipment (including firefighting equipment),  dispersants, or other mitigating substances and devices, and personnel  available to an owner or operator and federal, state, and local  agencies, to ensure an effective and immediate removal of a discharge,  and to ensure mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a  discharge (this may be provided in an appendix or by reference to other  relevant emergency plans (e.g., state or LEPC plans), which may include  such equipment lists);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A description of procedures to be followed for obtaining an  expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A detailed description of how the plan is integrated into other  ACPs and tank vessel, offshore facility, and onshore facility response  plans approved by the President, and into operating procedures of the  NSFCC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In order to provide for coordinated, immediate and effective  protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of, and minimization of risk of  injury to, fish and wildlife resources and habitat, Area Committees  shall incorporate into each ACP a detailed annex containing a Fish and  Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan that is consistent with the RCP  and NCP. The annex shall be prepared in consultation with the USFWS and  NOAA and other interested natural resource management agencies and  parties. It shall address fish and wildlife resources and their habitat,  and shall include other areas considered sensitive environments in a  separate section of the annex, based upon Area Committee  recommendations. The annex will provide the necessary information and  procedures to immediately and effectively respond to discharges that may  adversely affect fish and wildlife and their habitat and sensitive  environments, including provisions for a response to a worst case  discharge. Such information shall include the identification of  appropriate agencies and   their responsibilities, procedures to notify these agencies following a  discharge or threat of a discharge, protocols for obtaining required  fish and wildlife permits and other necessary permits, and provisions to  ensure compatibility of annex-related activities with removal  operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The annex shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife  resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas  requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges  that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any  seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special,  significant, or otherwise designated protected areas.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for  timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and  wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that  may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as  appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their  food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may  be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related  factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall  also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on  the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive  environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other  countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (e)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife,  their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal  actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on  this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should  establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal  actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex  should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and  wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to:  Disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent  taking or disturbance of fish and wildlife or specimens by response  personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally  sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or  bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas  where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident,  transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive  environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing  such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Provide for pre-approval of application of specific  countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will  minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources,  their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans  must be consistent with paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section  and subpart J requirements, and must have the concurrence of the natural  resource trustees.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of  different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the  environment. Monitoring should include ``set-aside'' or ``control''  areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of  necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and  rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may  include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals  with appropriate expertise and experience. The suitable organizations  should be identified in cooperation with natural resource law  enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but not be  limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary for  deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and for  capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans for  the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no  interference with other OSC removal operations.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and  alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and  rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and  provide for required fish   and wildlife handling and rehabilitation permits necessary under federal  and state laws; and provide guidance on the implementation of law  enforcement requirements included under current federal and state laws  and corresponding regulations. Requirements include, but are not limited  to procedures regarding the capture, transport, rehabilitation, and  release of wildlife exposed to or threatened by oil, and disposal of  contaminated carcasses of wildlife.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the  minimum required OSHA and EPA training for volunteers, including those  who assist with injured wildlife.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Define the requirements for evaluating the compatibility between  this annex and non-federal response plans (including those of vessels,  facilities, and pipelines) on issues affecting fish and wildlife, their  habitat, and sensitive environments.</p>
