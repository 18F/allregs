                            <p class="depth0">Provision shall be made for maintaining the frames of all off-track machines and the enclosures of related detached components at safe voltages by using one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A separate conductor(s) in the portable cable in addition to the power conductors by which the machine

frame can be connected to an acceptable grounding medium, and a separate conductor in all cables connecting related components not on a common chassis. The cross-sectional area of the additional conductor(s) shall not be less than 50 percent of that of one power conductor unless a ground-fault tripping relay is used, in which case the minimum size may be No. 8 (AWG). Cables smaller than No. 6 (AWG) shall have an additional conductor(s) of the same size as one power conductor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A means of actuating a circuit-interrupting device, preferably at the outby end of the portable cable.</p><p class="depth2">Note: The frame to ground potential shall not exceed 40 volts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A device(s) such as a diode(s) of adequate peak inverse voltage rating and current-carrying capacity to conduct possible fault current through the grounded power conductor. Diode installations shall include: (1) An overcurrent device in series with the diode, the contacts of which are in the machine's control circuit; and (2) a blocking diode in the control circuit to prevent operation of the machine with the polarity reversed.</p>
