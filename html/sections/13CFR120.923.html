                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Financing provided by the seller of Project Property must be subordinate to the 504 loan. SBA may waive the subordination requirement if the property is classified as ``other real estate owned'' by a national bank or other Federally regulated lender and SBA considers the property to be of sufficient value to support the 504 loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Borrower is eligible for a 504 loan even if part of the Project financing is tax-exempt. SBA's lien position must not be subordinate to loans made from the proceeds of the tax-exempt obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Borrower must not prepay any Project financing subordinate to the 504 loan without SBA's prior written consent.
