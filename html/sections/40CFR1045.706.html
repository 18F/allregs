                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section apply for calculating evaporative  emission credits. This applies only for fuel tank permeation. You may  generate credits only if you are a certifying vessel manufacturer. This  may include outboard engine manufacturers if they install under-cowl  fuel tanks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For each participating vessel, calculate positive or negative  emission credits relative to the otherwise applicable emission standard.  Calculate positive emission credits for a family that has an FEL below  the standard. Calculate negative emission credits for a family that has  an FEL above the standard. Sum your positive and negative credits for  the model year before rounding. Round the sum of emission credits to the  nearest kilogram (kg) using consistent units throughout the following  equation:  Emission credits (kg) = (STD-FEL) x (Total Area) x (UL) x (AF) x (365) x  (10-3) Where:  STD = the emission standard, in g/m\2\/day. FEL = the family emission limit for the family, in g/m\2\/day, as</p><p class="depth2">described in paragraph (b) of this section. Total Area = The combined internal surface area of all fuel tanks in the</p><p class="depth2">family, in m\2\. UL = 5 years, which represents the useful life for the given family. AF = adjustment factor. Use 1.0 for fuel tank testing performed at 28</p><p class="depth2">[deg]C and 0.60 for testing performed at 40 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For calculating credits under paragraph (a) of this section, the  emission standard and FEL must both be based on test measurements at the  same temperature (28 [deg] or 40 [deg]C). Determine the FEL for  calculating emission credits (relative to testing at 28 [deg]C) as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To use an FEL below 5.0 g/m\2\/day, it must be based on emission  measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> apply for all emission  families with FELs at or above 5.0 g/m\2\/day. To calculate emission  credits for such emission families, you must choose from one of the  following options and apply it to all your emission families with FELs  at or above 5.0 g/m\2\/day:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Option 1: Establish all your FELs based on emission  measurements. This may include measurements from a certifying fuel tank  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Option 2: Use an assigned FEL of 10.4 g/m\2\/day. This would  apply without regard to whether any of these emission families have  measured emission levels below 10.4 g/m\2\/day. If any of your fuel  tanks were otherwise certified (by you or the fuel tank manufacturer)  with an FEL between 5.0 and 10.4 g/m\2\/day, the assigned FEL of 10.4 g/ m\2\/day applies only for emission credit calculations.</p>
