Any application for inspection under this section may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Approval of an official import inspection establishment may be withdrawn in accordance with applicable rules of practice if it is determined that the sanitary conditions are such that the product is rendered adulterated, that such action is authorized by

If the inspector determines, on the basis of the sample examination, that the product does not meet the requirements of the Act and regulations thereunder, the consignment shall be refused entry. However, a consignment rejected for container defects but otherwise acceptable may be reoffered for inspection under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the defective containers are not indicative of an unsafe and unstable product as determined by the Administrator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the number and kinds of container defects found in the original sample do not exceed the limits specified for this purpose in FSIS guidelines; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the defective containers in the consignment have been sorted out and exported or destroyed under the supervision of an inspector.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Program inspectors or Customs officers at border or seaboard ports shall report the sealing of cars, trucks, or other means of conveyance, and the sealing or identification of containers of foreign product to Program personnel at points where such product is to be inspected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Representative samples of canned product designated by the Administrator in instructions to inspectors shall be incubated under supervision of such inspectors in accordance with Sec. 318.309(d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv)(c), (d)(1)(v), (d)(1)(vii) and (d)(1)(viii) of this chapter.
