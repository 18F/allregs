                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing a  written summary of the proceeding shall be prepared. This summary shall,  at a minimum, identify:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dates of and known attendees at the hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bases upon which the respondent contested the terms of the  order.  The summary must be signed by the Presiding Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Presiding Officer will evaluate the entire administrative  record and, on the basis of that review and the representations of EPA  and respondent at the hearing, shall prepare and file a recommended  decision with the Regional Administrator. The recommended decision must  address all material issues of fact or law properly raised by  respondent, and must recommend that the order be modified, withdrawn or  issued without modification. The recommended decision must provide an  explanation with citation to material contained in the record for any  decision to modify a term of the order, to issue the order without  change, or to withdraw the order. The recommended decision shall be  based on the administrative record. If the Presiding Officer finds that  any contested relief provision in the order is not supported by a  preponderance of the evidence in the record, the Presiding Officer shall  recommend that the order be modified and issued on terms that are  supported by the record or withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At any time within twenty-one (21) days of service of the  recommended decision on the parties, the parties may file comments on  the recommended decision with the Clerk. The Clerk shall promptly  transmit any such comments received to the Regional Administrator for  his consideration in reaching a final decision.</p>
