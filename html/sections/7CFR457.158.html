Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers  without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler,  retailer, packer, processor, shipper, buyer, or broker. Examples of  direct marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand,  or a farmer's market, and permitting the general public to enter the  field for the purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Apples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That are sold, or could be sold, for human consumption without  undergoing any change in the basic form, such as peeling, juicing,  crushing, etc.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> From acreage that is designated as fresh apples on the acreage  report;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> That follow the recommended cultural practices generally in  use for fresh apple acreage in the area in a manner generally recognized  by agricultural experts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> From acreage that you certify, and, if requested by us provide  verifiable records to support, that at least 50 percent of the  production from acreage reported as fresh apple acreage from each unit,  was sold as fresh apples in one or more of the four most recent crop  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acreage with production not meeting all the requirements above  must be designated on the acreage report as processing apple production.</p><p class="depth0">Grade standards. The United States Standards for Grades of Apples,  the United States Standards for Grades of Apples for Processing, or such  other standards contained in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Harvest. The picking of mature apples from the trees or collecting  of mature apples from the ground. Apples collected from the ground that  cannot be sold for human consumption will not be considered harvested.</p><p class="depth0">Marketable. Apple production that is not damaged apple production.</p><p class="depth0">Mature. Apples defined as ``mature'' under the applicable grade  standards.</p><p class="depth0">Pounds. Sixteen (16) ounces avoirdupois.</p><p class="depth0">Processing apple production. Apples from insurable acreage failing  to meet the insurability requirements for fresh apple production that  are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sold, or could be sold for the purpose of undergoing a change to  the basic structure such as peeling, juicing, crushing, etc.; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> From acreage designated as processing apples on the acreage  report.</p><p class="depth0">Production guarantee (per acre). The quantity of apples in boxes or  bushels determined by multiplying the approved APH yield per acre by the  coverage level percentage you elect. If the production of apples has  been measured in bins, the amount must be converted to boxes or bushels.</p><p class="depth0">Russeting. A defect on the surface of the apple as described in the  grade standards.</p><p class="depth0">Sunburn. A defect as described in the grade standards.</p><p class="depth0">Type. A category of apples as designated in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unit Division</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 34(b) of the Basic  Provisions, optional units may be established if each optional unit is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Located on non-contiguous land; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By type as specified in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining</p><p class="depth0">Indemnities</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic  Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> You may select only one coverage level for all fresh apple  acreage and only one coverage level for all processing apple acreage.  For example, if you choose the 55 percent coverage level for all your  fresh apple acreage (i.e., fresh, varietal group types), you may choose  the 75 percent coverage level for all your processing apple acreage.  However, if you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of  insurance for fresh apple acreage or processing apple acreage, the CAT  level of coverage will be applicable to all insured apple acreage in the  county. If you only have fresh apple acreage designated on your acreage  report and processing apple acreage is added after the sales closing  date, we will assign a coverage level equal to the coverage level you  selected for your fresh apple acreage. If you only have processing apple  acreage designated on your acreage report and fresh apple acreage is  added after the sales closing date, we will assign a coverage level  equal to the coverage level you selected for your processing apple  acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You may select only one price election for all the apples in the  county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide  different price elections by type, in which case you may select one  price election for each apple type designated in the Special Provisions.  The price elections you choose for each type must have the same  percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each  type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price  election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum  price election for all other types.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> You must report, by the production reporting date designated in  section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type, if applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any event or action that could impact the yield potential of the  insured crop including interplanted perennial crop, removal of trees,  any damage, change in practices, or any other circumstance that may  reduce the expected yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based,  and the number of affected acres;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable  acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with  another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such  acreage has changed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The age and type of the interplanted crop, if applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The planting pattern; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any other information that we request in order to establish  your approved yield.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> We will reduce the yield used to establish your production  guarantee, as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of any  situation listed in sections 3(c)(1) through (c)(4). If the situation  occurred:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Before the beginning of the insurance period, the yield used to  establish your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop  year regardless of whether the situation was due to an insured or  uninsured cause of loss. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance  that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce the  yield used to establish your production guarantee at any time we become  aware of the circumstance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Or may occur after the beginning of the insurance period and you  notify us by the production reporting date, the yield used to establish  your production guarantee will be reduced for the current crop year only  if the potential reduction in the yield used to establish your  production guarantee is due to an uninsured cause of loss; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Or may occur after the beginning of the insurance period and you  fail to notify us by the production reporting date, production lost due  to uninsured causes equal to the amount of the reduction in the yield  used to establish your production guarantee will be applied in  determining any indemnity (see section 12(c)(1)(ii)). We will reduce the  yield used to establish your production guarantee for the subsequent  crop year.</p><p class="depth0">4. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract  change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation date for California  and August 31 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.</p><p class="depth0">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the  cancellation and termination dates are January 31 in California and  November 20 in all other states.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If, in accordance with the terms of the policy, your apple  policy is canceled or terminated by us for any crop year after insurance  attached for that crop year, but on or before the cancellation and  termination dates, whichever is later, insurance will be considered not  to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee,  or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> We may not cancel your policy when an insured cause of loss has  occurred after insurance attached, but prior to the cancellation date.  However, your policy can be terminated if a cause for termination  contained in sections 2 or 27 of the Basic Provisions exists.</p><p class="depth0">6. Report of Acreage.</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements contained in section 6 of the Basic  Provisions, you must report and designate all acreage by type by the  acreage reporting date. Any acreage not qualifying for fresh apple  production is not eligible for the Optional Coverage for Fresh Fruit  Quality Adjustment option contained in section 14 of these Crop  Provisions. If you designate fresh apple acreage on the acreage report,  you are certifying at least 50 percent of the production from acreage  reported as fresh apple acreage, by unit, was sold as fresh apples in  one or more of the four most recent crop years in accordance with the  definition of ``fresh apple production'' and that you have the records  to support such production.</p><p class="depth0">7. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop  insured will be all apples in the county for which a premium rate is  provided by the actuarial table:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In which you have a share;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> That are grown on tree varieties that are adapted to the area  and have, in at least one of the previous four years, produced:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 10 bins of apples per acre in Area A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 150 bushels of apples per acre in Area B; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 200 bushels of apples per acre in Area C;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered  acceptable by us; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> That are grown for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fresh apple production; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Processing apple production.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that  prohibit insurance from attaching to a crop planted with another crop,  apples interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we  inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements  contained in your policy.</p><p class="depth0">9. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic  Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the year of application, coverage begins on February 1 of  the calendar year the insured crop normally blooms in California and  November 21 of the calendar year prior to the calendar year the insured  crop normally blooms in all other States. Notwithstanding the previous  sentence, if your application is received by us after January 12 but  prior to February 1 in California, or after November 1 but prior to  November 21 in all other States, insurance will attach on the 20th day  after your properly completed application is received in our local  office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 20-day period and  determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must  provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the  condition of the apple acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains  continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following  the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy  cancellation that results solely from transferring an existing policy to  a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be  considered a break in continuous coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each  crop year is November 5, or such other date as specified in the Special  Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, coverage will  not be considered to have begun for a crop year if the policy is  canceled or terminated in accordance with section 5(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic  Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after  coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop  year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable,  insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the  calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. There will be  no coverage of any insurable interest acquired after the acreage  reporting date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage  of apples on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year,  insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or  indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar  form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such  transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage  of apples after the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance  coverage will be provided for any loss due to an insurable cause of loss  that occurred prior to the date that you relinquished your insurable  share and the whole premium will be due for such acreage for that crop  year.</p><p class="depth0">10. Causes of Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic  Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of  loss that occur during the insurance period and result in damaged apple  production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adverse weather conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fire unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been  controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper  application of pest control measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper  application of disease control measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Volcanic eruption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured  peril that occurs during the insurance period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Wildlife; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> All other natural causes of loss that cannot be prevented,  including, but not limited to, hail, wind, excess sun causing sunburn,  and frost and freeze causing russeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the  Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of  production due to your inability to market the apples for any reason  other than actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in  this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are  unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to  accept production.</p><p class="depth0">11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic  Provisions, you must leave representative samples in accordance with our  procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic  Provisions, the following will apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must notify us at least 3 days prior to the date harvest  should have started if the crop will not be harvested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from  any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal  that will be used to determine your production to count for production  that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal,  we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any  acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your  production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will  be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of  production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre  if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify  us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if  damage is discovered during harvest. You must not sell or dispose of the  damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If  you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such failure  results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such  production will be considered undamaged and included as production to  count.</p><p class="depth0">12. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you  are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for  which such production records were not provided; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production  to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage  for the units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will  settle your claim on any unit by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production  guarantee, by type as applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective  price election and by the percent of price election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2) if there are more than  one type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)),  for each type as applicable, by the respective price election and by the  percent of price election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4), if there are more than  one type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Subtracting the total in section 12(b)(5) from the total in  section 12(b)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(6) by your share.</p><p class="depth0">Basic Coverage Example:</p><p class="depth0">You have a 100 percent share in one basic unit with 10 acres of  fresh apples and 5 acres of processing apples designated on your acreage  report, with a 600 bushel per acre production guarantee for both fresh  and processing apples, and you select 100 percent of the price election  on a price election of $9.10 per bushel for fresh apples and $2.50 per  bushel for processing apples. You harvest 5,000 bushels of fresh apples  and 1,000 bushels of processing apples, all grading U.S. No. 1  Processing or better. Your indemnity will be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. 10 acres x 600 bushels = 6,000-bushel production guarantee of  fresh apples;</p><p class="depth0">5 acres x 600 bushels = 3,000-bushel production guarantee of  processing apples;</p><p class="depth0">B. 6,000-bushel production guarantee x $9.10 price election x 100  percent of price election = $54,600 value of production guarantee for  fresh apples;</p><p class="depth0">3,000-bushel production guarantee x $2.50 price election x 100  percent of price election = $7,500 value of production guarantee for  processing apples;</p><p class="depth0">C. $54,600 value of production guarantee for fresh apples + $7,500  value of production   guarantee for processing apples = $62,100.00 total value of the  production guarantee;</p><p class="depth0">D. 5,000 bushels of fresh apple production to count x $9.10 price  election x 100 percent of price election = $45,500 value of fresh apple  production to count;</p><p class="depth0">1,000 bushels of processing apple production to count x $2.50 price  election x 100 percent of price election = $2,500 value of processing  apple production to count;</p><p class="depth0">E. $45,500 value of fresh apple production to count + $2,500 value  of processing apple production to count = $48,000 total value of  production to count;</p><p class="depth0">F. $62,100 total value of the production guarantee - $48,000 total  value of production to count = $14,100.00 value of loss; and</p><p class="depth0">G. $14,100 value of loss x 100 percent share = $14,100 indemnity  payment.</p><p class="depth0">[End of Example]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The total production to count (in boxes or bushels) from all  insurable acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All appraised production as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the  requirements contained in section 11;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For which you fail to provide production records that are  acceptable to us;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unharvested apple production that would be marketable if  harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Potential marketable apple production on insured acreage that  you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the  appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance  period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our  appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care  for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of  further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you  harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production.  If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to  deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested marketable production from the insurable acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any apple production not graded or appraised prior to the  earlier of the time apples are placed in storage or the date the apples  are delivered to a packer, processor, or other handler will not be  considered damaged apple production and will be considered production to  count.</p><p class="depth0">13. Late and Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0">The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions  are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">14. Optional Coverage for Fresh Fruit Quality Adjustment</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the event of a conflict between the Apple Crop Insurance  Provisions and this option, this option will control. Insureds who  select this option cannot receive less than the indemnity due under  section 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In return for payment of the additional premium designated in  the actuarial documents, this option provides for quality adjustment of  fresh apple production as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To be eligible for this option, you must have elected to insure  your apples at the additional coverage level. If you elect Catastrophic  Risk Protection (CAT) after this option is effective, it will be  considered as notice of cancellation of this option by you.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You must elect this option on or before the sales closing date  for the initial crop year for which you wish to insure your apples under  this option. This option will continue in effect until canceled by  either you or us for any succeeding crop year by written notice to the  other party on or before the cancellation date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This option will apply to all your apple acreage designated in  your acreage report as grown for fresh apple production and that meets  the insurability requirements specified in the Apple Crop Insurance  Provisions, except any acreage specifically excluded by the actuarial  documents.

You harvest 5,000 bushels of apples from your designated  fresh apple acreage, but only 2,650 of those bushels grade U.S. Fancy or  better. Assuming you do not sell any of your fresh apple production as  U.S. Fancy or better, your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">A. 10 acres x 600 bushels per acre = 6,000-bushel production  guarantee of fresh apples;</p><p class="depth0">B. 6,000-bushel production guarantee of fresh apples x $9.10 price  election x 100 percent of price election = $54,600 value of production  guarantee for fresh apple acreage;</p><p class="depth0">C. The value of the fresh apple production to count is determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. 5,000 bushels harvested - 2,650 bushels that graded U.S. Fancy or  better = 2,350 bushels of fresh apple production not grading U.S. Fancy  or better;</p><p class="depth0">ii. 2,350/5,000 = 47 percent of fresh apple production not grading  U.S. Fancy or better;</p><p class="depth0">iii. In accordance with section 14(b)(5)(ii): 47 percent - 40  percent = 7 percent in excess of 40 percent;</p><p class="depth0">iv. 7 percent x 3 = 21 percent;</p><p class="depth0">v. 40 percent + 21 percent = 61 percent;</p><p class="depth0">vi. 5,000 bushels harvested x .61 (61 percent) = 3,050 bushels of  fresh apple production not grading U.S. Fancy or better;</p><p class="depth0">vii. 5,000 bushels harvested - 3,050 bushels of fresh apple  production not grading U.S. Fancy or better = 1,950 bushels of adjusted  fresh apple production to count;</p><p class="depth0">viii. 1,950 bushels of adjusted fresh apples production to count x  $9.10 price election x 100 percent of price election = $17,745 value of  fresh apple production to count;</p><p class="depth0">D. $54,600 value of production guarantee for fresh apples - $17,745  value of fresh apple production to count = $36,855 value of loss;</p><p class="depth0">E. $36,855 value of loss x 100 percent share = $36,855 indemnity  payment.</p><p class="depth0">[End of Example]  [63 FR 17054, Apr. 8, 1998, as amended at 65 FR 47839, Aug. 4, 2000; 69  FR 52591, Aug. 27, 2004; 69 FR 53500, Sept. 1, 2004; 69 FR 62803, Oct.  28, 2004; 75 FR 52231, Aug. 25, 2010]</p>
