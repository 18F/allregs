                            <p class="depth0">The referendum agent, in addition to any other duties imposed by  this subpart, shall:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of adjusting the rate of assessment, determine  and publicly announce prior to the voting period the total volume of  fluid milk products marketed by all processors of fluid milk in the  United States during the representative period and the portion of such  volume that must be represented by those fluid milk processors voting in  favor of the question included on the ballot if the referendum question  is to pass.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within 12 days after the deadline for registering to vote in  the referendum, the referendum agent shall make available upon request a  list of those fluid milk processors that properly registered. Any  challenge of a processor's eligibility to vote must be received by the  referendum agent within 17 days of the deadline for voter registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the voting eligibility of any fluid milk processor is  challenged within the timeframe specified in Sec. 1160.604(b)(1), the  referendum agent shall review the challenge and make a final  determination regarding the processor's eligibility to vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prior to the time of mailing ballots to fluid milk processors,  the referendum agent shall prepare a final list of eligible voters and  make such list available upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verify the eligibility of all persons voting in the referendum  by reviewing all ballots cast to assure that each ballot:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was mailed within the prescribed time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contains all certifications required attesting to the  eligibility of the person to vote, and that the person voting filed with  the referendum agent prior to the voting period the advance registration  required pursuant to Sec. 1160.606(a)(1); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Was completed with respect to all necessary information  pertinent to the identification of the person voting so   that additional verification can be conducted by the referendum agent to  substantiate the eligibility of each such person to vote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conduct further verification, as necessary, to determine the  eligibility of each person to vote. Such verification may be completed  by reviewing readily available sources of information, including the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records of the Department;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fluid milk processors' records; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other reliable sources of information which may be available  to the referendum agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Further verify ballots to avoid a duplication of votes. The  following criteria shall serve as a guide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each fluid milk processor that is other than an individual shall  be regarded as one person for voting purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No more than one vote may be cast on behalf of any one fluid  milk processor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that more than one individual claim the right to  vote and cast a ballot for a fluid milk processor, concurring votes of  such individuals shall be treated as one vote while any conflicting  votes shall thereby invalidate all ballots cast by such individuals.
