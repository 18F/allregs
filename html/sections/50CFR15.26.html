                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a complete application, the Director may approve  cooperative breeding programs. Such approval will allow individuals to  import exotic birds otherwise prohibited by section 15.11, with permits  under section 15.24. Such approval for cooperative breeding programs  shall be granted in accordance with the issuance criteria of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application requirements for approval of cooperative breeding  programs. Each application shall provide the following information and  such other information that the Director may require:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the exotic bird(s) to be imported or to be  covered under the program, including the common and scientific names of  the species, number, sex ratio (if applicable), and age class;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the reasons the applicant is justified in  obtaining this approval, and a description of the cooperative breeding  program requested for the exotic bird species, including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A breeding protocol, including a genetic management plan and  breeding methods;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement on the plans for developing and maintaining a self- sustaining population in captivity of the exotic bird species;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Details on the system of recordkeeping and tracking of birds  and their progeny, including how individual specimens will be marked or  otherwise identified;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement on the relationship of such a breeding program to  the conservation of the exotic bird species in the world;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Details on the funding of this program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Plans for disposition of the exotic birds and any progeny;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A qualification statement for each individual who will be  overseeing the cooperative breeding program. This statement should  include information on the individual's prior experience with the same  or similar bird species. Individuals overseeing the program will be  required to demonstrate an affiliation with an avicultural,  conservation, or zoological organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of the oversight of the program by the avicultural,  zoological, or conservation organization, including their monitoring of  participation in the program, criteria for acceptance of individuals  into the program, and the relationship of the cooperative breeding  program to enhancing the propagation and survival of the species; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A history of the cooperative breeding program, including an  annual report for the last 3 years (if applicable), mortality records,  breeding records, and a studbook if one has been developed for the  species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide  whether or not a cooperative breeding program should be approved. In  making this decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the  general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the cooperative breeding program for which the approval  is requested is adequate to justify removing the exotic bird from the  wild or otherwise changing its status;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the granting of this approval would be detrimental to  the survival of the exotic bird species in the wild, including whether  the exotic   birds were bred in captivity or will be taken from the wild, taking into  consideration the conservation status of the species in the wild;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the granting of this approval would conflict with any  known program intended to enhance the survival of the population from  which the exotic bird species was or would be removed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the cooperative breeding program for which the permit is  requested would be likely to enhance or promote the conservation of the  exotic bird species in the wild or result in a self-sustaining  population of the exotic bird species in captivity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the expertise or other resources available to the  program appear adequate to successfully accomplish the objectives stated  in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Publication in the Federal Register. The Director shall publish  notice in the Federal Register of each application submitted under Sec.   15.26(a). Each notice shall invite the submission from interested  parties of written data, views, or arguments with respect to the  application. The Director shall publish periodically a notice as  appropriate in the Federal Register of the list of approved cooperative  breeding programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval conditions. In addition to the general conditions set  forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every approval issued under this  paragraph shall be subject to the special condition that the cooperative  breeding program shall maintain records of all birds imported under  permits issued under this subpart and their progeny, including their  sale or transfer, death, or escape, and breeding success. These records  shall be made available to the Service on request and when renewing an  approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of approval. Cooperative breeding programs shall be  approved for two years, at which time applicants may apply to the  Service for renewal of a program's approval. Applications for renewal of  approval shall comply with the general conditions set forth in part 13  of this subchapter.</p>
