                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Packages or overpacks containing hazardous materials must be inspected for damage or leakage after being unloaded from an aircraft. When packages or overpacks containing hazardous materials have been transported in a unit load device, the area where the unit load device was stowed must be inspected for evidence of leakage or contamination immediately upon removal of the unit load device from the aircraft, and the packages or overpacks must be inspected for evidence of damage or leakage when the unit load device is unloaded. In the event of leakage or suspected leakage, the compartment in which the package, overpack, or unit load device was carried must be inspected for contamination and decontaminated, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 175.700, the operator of an aircraft must remove from the aircraft any package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking or contaminated by a hazardous material.

In the case of a package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking, the operator must ensure that other packages, baggage or cargo in the same shipment are in proper condition for transport aboard the aircraft and that no other package, baggage or cargo has been contaminated or is leaking. If an operator becomes aware that a package, baggage or cargo not identified as containing a hazardous material has been contaminated, or the operator has cause to believe that a hazardous material may be the cause of the contamination, the operator must take reasonable steps to identify the nature and source of contamination before proceeding with the loading of the contaminated baggage or cargo. If the contaminating substance is found or suspected to be hazardous material, the operator must isolate the package, baggage or cargo and take appropriate steps to eliminate any identified hazard before continuing the transportation of the item by aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No person may place aboard an aircraft a package, baggage or cargo that is contaminated with a hazardous material or appears to be leaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a package containing a material in Division 6.2 (infectious substance) is found to be damaged or leaking, the person finding the package must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Avoid handling the package or keep handling to a minimum;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspect packages adjacent to the leaking package for contamination and withhold from further transportation any contaminated packages until it is ascertained that they can be safely transported;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comply with the reporting requirement of Secs. 171.15 and 175.31 of this subchapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notify the consignor or consignee.
