                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each flight recorder required by the operating rules of Subchapter G of this chapter must be installed so that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is supplied with airspeed, altitude, and directional data obtained from sources that meet the accuracy requirements of Sec. Sec. 29.1323, 29.1325, and 29.1327 of this part, as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vertical acceleration sensor is rigidly attached, and located longitudinally within the approved center of gravity limits of the rotorcraft;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> It receives its electrical power from the bus that provides the maximum reliability for operation of the flight data recorder without jeopardizing service to essential or emergency loads.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It receives its electrical power from the bus that provides the maximum reliability for operation of the flight data recorder without jeopardizing service to essential or emergency loads.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It remains powered for as long as possible without jeopardizing emergency operation of the rotorcraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There is an aural or visual means for perflight checking of the recorder for proper recording of data in the storage medium;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except for recorders powered solely by the engine-drive electrical generator system, there is an automatic means to simultaneously stop a recorder that has a data erasure feature and prevent each erasure feature from functioning, within 10 minutes after any crash impact; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder are installed in separate boxes or in a combination unit, no single electrical failure external to the recorder may disable both the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each nonejectable recorder container must be located and mounted so as to minimize the probability of container rupture resulting from crash impact and subsequent damage to the record from fire.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A correlation must be established between the flight recorder readings of airspeed, altitude, and heading and the corresponding readings (taking into account correction factors) of the first pilot's instruments. This correlation must cover the airspeed range over which the aircraft is to be operated, the range of altitude to which the aircraft is limited, and 360 degrees of heading. Correlation may be established on the ground as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each recorder container must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be either bright orange or bright yellow;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have a reflective tape affixed to its external surface to facilitate its location under water; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have an underwater locating device, when required by the operating rules of this chapter, on or adjacent to the container which is secured in such a manner that it is not likely to be separated during crash impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When both a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder are required by the operating rules, one combination unit may be installed, provided that all other requirements of this section and the requirements for cockpit voice recorders under this part are met.
