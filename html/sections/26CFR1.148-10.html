                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Abusive arbitrage device--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Bonds of an issue are  arbitrage bonds under section 148 if an abusive arbitrage device under  paragraph (a)(2) of this section is used in connection with the issue.  This paragraph (a) is to be applied and interpreted broadly to carry out  the purposes of section 148, as further described in Sec. 1.148-0.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any  action that is expressly permitted by section 148 or Sec. Sec. 1.148-1  through 1.148-11 is not an abusive arbitrage device (e.g., investment in  higher yielding investments during a permitted temporary period under  section 148(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Abusive arbitrage device defined. Any action is an abusive  arbitrage device if the action has the effect of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enabling the issuer to exploit the difference between tax-exempt  and taxable interest rates to obtain a material financial advantage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overburdening the tax-exempt bond market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exploitation of tax-exempt interest rates. An action may exploit  tax-exempt interest rates under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a  result of an investment of any portion of the gross proceeds of an issue  over any period of time, notwithstanding that, in the aggregate, the  gross proceeds of the issue are not invested in higher yielding  investments over the term of the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)(B)</em>. These factors may be  outweighed by other factors, however, such as bona fide cost underruns  or long-term financial distress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Consequences of overburdening the tax-exempt bond market--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. An issue that overburdens the tax-exempt bond market (within  the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section) is subject to the  following special limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Special yield restriction. Investments are subject to the  definition of materially higher yield under Sec. 1.148-2(d) that is  equal to one-thousandth of 1 percent. In addition, each investment is  treated as a separate class of investments under Sec. 1.148- 5(b)(2)(ii), the yield on which may not be blended with that of other  investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain regulatory provisions inapplicable. The provisions of  Sec. 1.148-5(c) (relating to yield reduction payments) and Sec. 1.148- 5(e) (2) and (3) (relating to recovery of qualified administrative  costs) do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application. The provisions of this paragraph (b) only apply to  the portion of an issue that, as a result of actions taken (or actions  not taken) after the issue date, overburdens the market for tax-exempt  bonds, except that for an issue that is reasonably expected as of the  issue date to overburden the market, those provisions apply to all of  the gross proceeds of the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Anti-abuse rules on excess gross proceeds of advance refunding  issues--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph  (c), an abusive arbitrage device is used and bonds of an advance  refunding issue are arbitrage bonds if the issue has excess gross  proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of excess gross proceeds. Excess gross proceeds means  all gross proceeds of an advance refunding issue that exceed an amount  equal to 1 percent of sale proceeds of the issue, other than gross  proceeds allocable to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payment of principal, interest, or call premium on the prior  issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payment of pre-issuance accrued interest on the refunding  issue, and interest on the refunding issue that accrues for a period up  to the completion date of any capital project for which the prior issue  was issued, plus one year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A reasonably required reserve or replacement fund for the  refunding issue or investment proceeds of such a fund;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Payment of costs of issuance of the refunding issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Payment of administrative costs allocable to repaying the prior  issue, carrying and repaying the refunding issue, or investments of the  refunding issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Transferred proceeds that will be used or maintained for the  governmental purpose of the prior issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Interest on purpose investments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Replacement proceeds in a sinking fund for the refunding  issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Qualified guarantee fees for the refunding issue or the prior  issue; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Fees for a qualified hedge for the refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special treatment of transferred proceeds. For purposes of this  paragraph (c), all unspent proceeds of the prior issue as of the issue  date of the refunding issue are treated as transferred proceeds of the  advance refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule for crossover refundings. An advance refunding  issue is not an issue of arbitrage bonds under this paragraph (c) if all  excess gross proceeds of the refunding issue are used to pay interest  that accrues on the refunding issue before the prior issue is  discharged, and no gross proceeds of any refunding issue are used to pay  interest on the prior issue or to replace funds used directly or  indirectly to pay such interest (other than transferred proceeds used to  pay interest on the prior issue that accrues for a period up to the  completion date of the project for which the prior issue was issued,  plus one year, or proceeds used to pay principal that is attributable to  accrued original issue discount).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> applies  if an advance refunding issue (the series B issue) is used together with  one or more other advance refunding issues (the series A issues) in a  gross refunding of a prior issue, but only if the use of a gross  refunding method is required under bond documents that were effective  prior to November 6, 1992. These advance refunding issues are not  arbitrage bonds under this paragraph (c) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All excess gross proceeds of the series B issue and each series  A issue are investment proceeds used to pay principal and interest on  the series B issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least 99 percent of all principal and interest on the series  B issue is paid with proceeds of the series B and series A issues or  with the earnings on other amounts in the refunding escrow for the prior  issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The series B issue is discharged not later than the prior  issue; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> As of any date, the amount of gross proceeds of the series B  issue allocated to expenditures does not exceed the aggregate amount of  expenditures before that date for principal and interest on the series B  issue, and administrative costs of carrying and repaying the series B  issue, or of investments of the series B issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Mortgage sale. In 1982, City issued its revenue issue  (the 1982 issue) and lent the proceeds to Developer to finance a low- income housing project under former section 103(b)(4)(A) of the 1954  Code. In 1994, Developer encounters financial difficulties and  negotiates with City to refund the 1982 issue. City issues $10 million  in principal amount of its 8 percent bonds (the 1994 issue). City lends  the proceeds of the 1994 issue to Developer. To evidence Developer's  obligation to repay that loan, Developer, as obligor, issues a note to  City (the City note). Bank agrees to provide Developer with a direct-pay  letter of credit pursuant to which Bank will make all payments to the  trustee for the 1994 issue necessary to meet Developer's obligations  under the City note. Developer pays Bank a fee for the issuance of the  letter of credit and issues a note to Bank (the Bank note). The Bank  note is secured by a mortgage on the housing project and is guaranteed  by FHA. The Bank note and the 1994 issue have different prepayment  terms. The City does not reasonably expect to treat prepayments of the  Bank note as gross proceeds of the 1994 issue. At the same time or  pursuant to a series of related transactions, Bank sells the Bank note  to Investor for $9.5 million. Bank invests these monies together with  its other funds. In substance, the transaction is a loan by City to  Bank, under which Bank enters into a series of transactions that, in  effect, result in Bank retaining $9.5 million in amounts treated as  proceeds of the 1994 issue. Those amounts are invested in materially  higher yielding investments that provide funds sufficient to equal or  exceed the Bank's liability under the letter of credit. Alternatively,  the letter of credit is investment property in a sinking fund for the  1994 issue provided by Developer, a substantial beneficiary of the  financing. Because, in substance, Developer acquires the $10 million  principal amount letter of credit for a fair market value purchase price  of $9.5 million, the letter of credit is a materially higher yielding  investment. Neither result would change if Developer's obligation under  the Bank note is contingent on Bank performing its obligation under the  letter of credit. Each characterization causes the bonds to be arbitrage  bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Longer   bond maturity to create sinking fund. In 1994, Authority issues an  advance refunding issue (the refunding issue) to refund a 1982 prior  issue (the prior issue). Under current market conditions, Authority will  have to invest the refunding escrow at a yield significantly below the  yield on the refunding issue. Authority issues its refunding issue with  a longer weighted average maturity than otherwise necessary primarily  for the purpose of creating a sinking fund for the refunding issue that  will be invested in a guaranteed investment contract. The weighted  average maturity of the refunding issue is less than 120 percent of the  remaining average economic life of the facilities financed with the  proceeds of the prior issue. The guaranteed investment contract has a  yield that is higher than the yield on the refunding issue. The yield on  the refunding escrow blended with the yield on the guaranteed investment  contract does not exceed the yield on the issue. The refunding issue  uses an abusive arbitrage device and the bonds of the issue are  arbitrage bonds under section 148(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Refunding of noncallable bonds. The facts are the same as in  paragraph (i) of this Example 2 except that instead of structuring the  refunding issue to enable it to take advantage of sinking fund  investments, Authority will also refund other long-term, non-callable  bonds in the same refunding issue. There are no savings attributable to  the refunding of the non-callable bonds (e.g., a low-to-high refunding).  The Authority invests the portion of the proceeds of the refunding issue  allocable to the refunding of the non-callable bonds in the refunding  escrow at a yield that is higher than the yield on the refunding issue,  based on the relatively long escrow period for this portion of the  refunding. The Authority invests the other portion of the proceeds of  the refunding issue in the refunding escrow at a yield lower than the  yield on the refunding issue. The blended yield on all the investments  in the refunding escrow for the prior issues does not exceed the yield  on the refunding issue. The portion of the refunding issue used to  refund the noncallable bonds, however, was not otherwise necessary and  was issued primarily to exploit the difference between taxable and tax- exempt rates for that long portion of the refunding escrow to minimize  the effect of lower yielding investments in the other portion of the  escrow. The refunding issue uses an abusive arbitrage device and the  bonds of the issue are arbitrage bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Governmental purpose. In paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this  Example 2, the existence of a governmental purpose for the described  financing structures would not change the conclusions unless Authority  clearly established that the primary purpose for the use of the  particular structure was a bona fide governmental purpose. The fact that  each financing structure had the effect of eliminating significant  amounts of negative arbitrage is strong evidence of a primary purpose  that is not a bona fide governmental purpose. Moreover, in paragraph (i)  of this Example 2, the structure of the refunding issue coupled with the  acquisition of the guaranteed investment contract to lock in the  investment yield associated with the structure is strong evidence of a  primary purpose that is not a bona fide governmental purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Authority issues its 1994 refunding  issue to refund a portion of the principal and interest on its  outstanding 1985 issue. The 1994 refunding issue is structured using  zero-coupon bonds that pay no interest or principal for the 5-year  period following the issue date. The proceeds of the 1994 refunding  issue are deposited in a refunding escrow to be used to pay only the  interest requirements of the refunded portion of the 1985 issue.  Authority enters into a guaranteed investment contract with a financial  institution, G, under which G agrees to provide a guaranteed yield on  revenues invested by Authority during the 5-year period following the  issue date. The guaranteed investment contract has a yield that is no  higher than the yield on the refunding issue. The revenues to be  invested under this guaranteed investment contract consist of the  amounts that Authority otherwise would have used to pay principal and  interest on the 1994 refunding issue. The guaranteed investment contract  is structured to generate receipts at times and in amounts sufficient to  pay the principal and redemption requirements of the refunded portion of  the 1985 issue. A principal purpose of these transactions is to avoid  transferred proceeds. Authority will continue to invest the unspent  proceeds of the 1985 issue that are on deposit in a refunding escrow for  its 1982 issue at a yield equal to the yield on the 1985 issue and will  not otherwise treat those unspent proceeds as transferred proceeds of  the 1994 refunding issue. The 1994 refunding issue is an issue of  arbitrage bonds since those bonds involve a transaction or series of  transactions that overburdens the market by leaving bonds outstanding  longer than is necessary to obtain a material financial advantage based  on arbitrage. Specifically, Authority has structured the 1994 refunding  issue to make available for the refunding of the 1985 issue replacement  proceeds rather than proceeds so that the unspent proceeds of the 1985  issue will not become transferred proceeds of the 1994 refunding issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The result would be the same in each of the following  circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3  except that Authority does not enter into the guaranteed investment  contract but instead, as of the issue date of the 1994 refunding issue,  reasonably expects that the released revenues will be   available for investment until used to pay principal and interest on the  1985 issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3  except that there are no unspent proceeds of the 1985 issue and  Authority invests the released revenues at a yield materially higher  than the yield on the 1994 issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3  except that Authority uses the proceeds of the 1994 issue for capital  projects instead of to refund a portion of the 1985 issue.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Sale of conduit loan. On January 1, 1994, Authority  issues a conduit financing issue (the 1994 conduit financing issue) and  uses the proceeds to purchase from City, an unrelated party, a tax- exempt bond of City (the City note). The proceeds of the 1994 conduit  financing issue are to be used to advance refund a prior conduit  financing issue that was issued in 1988 and used to make a loan to City.  The 1994 conduit financing issue and the City note each have a yield of  8 percent on January 1, 1994. On June 30, 1996, interest rates have  decreased and Authority sells the City note to D, a person unrelated to  either City or Authority. Based on the sale price of the City note and  treating June 30, 1996 as the issue date of the City note, the City note  has a 6 percent yield. Authority deposits the proceeds of the sale of  the City note into an escrow to redeem the bonds of the 1994 conduit  financing issue on January 1, 2001. The escrow is invested in nonpurpose  investments having a yield of 8 percent. For purposes of section 149(d),  City and Authority are related parties and, therefore, the issue date of  the City note is treated as being June 30, 1996. Thus, the City note is  an advance refunding of Authority's 1994 conduit financing issue.  Interest on the City note is not exempt from Federal income tax from the  date it is sold to D under section 149(d), because, by investing the  escrow investments at a yield of 8 percent instead of a yield not  materially higher than 6 percent, the sale of the City note employs a  device to obtain a material financial advantage, based on arbitrage,  apart from the savings attributable to lower interest rates. In  addition, the City note is not a tax-exempt bond because the note is the  second advance refunding of the original bond under section 149(d)(3).  The City note also employs an abusive arbitrage device and is an  arbitrage bond under section 148.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1984, City issues a tax- exempt issue (the 1984 issue) to finance the cost of constructing a  prison. The 1984 issue has a 7 percent yield and a 30-year maturity. The  1984 issue is callable at any time on or after January 1, 1994. On  January 1, 1990, City issues a refunding issue (the 1990 issue) to  advance refund the 1984 issue. The 1990 issue has an 8 percent yield and  a 30-year maturity. The 1990 issue is callable at any time on or after  January 1, 2000. The proceeds of the 1990 issue are invested at an 8  percent yield in a refunding escrow for the 1984 issue (the original  1984 escrow) in a manner sufficient to pay debt service on the 1984  issue until maturity (i.e., an escrow to maturity). On January 1, 1994,  City issues a refunding issue (the 1994 issue). The 1994 issue has a 6  percent yield and a 30-year maturity. City does not invest the proceeds  of the 1994 issue in a refunding escrow for the 1990 issue in a manner  sufficient to pay a portion of the debt service until, and redeem a  portion of that issue on, January 1, 2000. Instead, City invests those  proceeds at a 6 percent yield in a new refunding escrow for a portion of  the 1984 issue (the new 1984 escrow) in a manner sufficient to pay debt  service on a portion of the 1984 issue until maturity. City also  liquidates the investments allocable to the proceeds of the 1990 issue  held in the original 1984 escrow and reinvests those proceeds in an  escrow to pay a portion of the debt service on the 1990 issue itself  until, and redeem a portion of that issue on, January 1, 2000 (the 1990  escrow). The 1994 bonds are arbitrage bonds and employ an abusive device  under section 149(d)(4). Although, in form, the proceeds of the 1994  issue are used to pay principal on the 1984 issue, this accounting for  the use of the proceeds of the 1994 issue is an unreasonable,  inconsistent accounting method under Sec. 1.148-6(a). Moreover, since  the proceeds of the 1990 issue were set aside in an escrow to be used to  retire the 1984 issue, the use of proceeds of the 1994 issue for that  same purpose involves a replacement of funds invested in higher yielding  investments under section 148(a)(2). Thus, using a reasonable,  consistent accounting method and giving effect to the substance of the  transaction, the proceeds of the 1994 issue are treated as used to  refund the 1990 issue and are allocable to the 1990 escrow. The proceeds  of the 1990 issue are treated as used to refund the 1984 issue and are  allocable to the investments in the new 1984 escrow. The proceeds of the  1990 issue allocable to the nonpurpose investments in the new 1984  escrow become transferred proceeds of the 1994 issue as principal is  paid on the 1990 issue from amounts on deposit in the 1990 escrow. As a  result, the yield on nonpurpose investments allocable to the 1994 issue  is materially higher than the yield on the 1994 issue, causing the bonds  of the 1994 issue to be arbitrage bonds. In addition, the transaction  employs a device under section 149(d)(4) to obtain a material financial  advantage based on arbitrage, other than savings attributable to lower  interest rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following changes in the facts do not affect the conclusion  that the 1994 issue consists of arbitrage bonds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The 1990 issue is a taxable issue;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The original 1984 escrow is used to pay the 1994 issue (rather  than the 1990 issue); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The 1994 issue is used to retire the 1984 issue within 90 days  of January 1, 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Authority of the Commissioner to clearly reflect the economic  substance of a transaction. If an issuer enters into a transaction for a  principal purpose of obtaining a material financial advantage based on  the difference between tax-exempt and taxable interest rates in a manner  that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 148, the Commissioner  may exercise the Commissioner's discretion to depart from the rules of  Sec. 1.148-1 through Sec. 1.148-11 as necessary to clearly reflect the  economic substance of the transaction. For this purpose, the  Commissioner may recompute yield on an issue or on investments,  reallocate payments and receipts on investments, recompute the rebate  amount on an issue, treat a hedge as either a qualified hedge or not a  qualified hedge, or otherwise adjust any item whatsoever bearing upon  the investments and expenditures of gross proceeds of an issue. For  example, if the amount paid for a hedge is specifically based on the  amount of arbitrage earned or expected to be earned on the hedged bonds,  a principal purpose of entering into the contract is to obtain a  material financial advantage based on the difference between tax-exempt  and taxable interest rates in a manner that is inconsistent with the  purposes of section 148.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Authority of the Commissioner to require an earlier date for  payment of rebate. If the Commissioner determines that an issue is  likely to fail to meet the requirements of Sec. 1.148-3 and that a  failure to serve a notice of demand for payment on the issuer will  jeopardize the assessment or collection of tax on interest paid or to be  paid on the issue, the date that the Commissioner serves notice on the  issuer is treated as a required computation date for payment of rebate  for that issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Authority of the Commissioner to waive regulatory limitations.  Notwithstanding any specific provision in Sec. Sec. 1.148-1 through  1.148-11, the Commissioner may prescribe extensions of temporary  periods, larger reasonably required reserve or replacement funds, or  consequences of failures or remedial action under section 148 in lieu of  or in addition to other consequences of those failures, or take other  action, if the Commissioner finds that good faith or other similar  circumstances so warrant, consistent with the purposes of section 148.
