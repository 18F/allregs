                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For both competitive and noncompetitive applications, peer  review will normally consist of written comments provided in response to  the general selection criteria established under subpart A of this part  and any program specific selection criteria identified in the program  announcement or otherwise established by the Administrator, together  with the assignment of numerical values. Peer review may be conducted at  meetings with peer reviewers held under OJJDP oversight, through mail  reviews, or a combination of both. When advisable, site visits may also  be employed. The method of peer review anticipated for each announced  competitive program, including the evaluation criteria to be used by  peer reviewers, will be specified in each program announcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When peer review is conducted through meetings, peer review  panelists will be gathered together for instruction by OJJDP, including  review of the OJJDP ``Peer Review Guideline''. OJJDP will oversee the  conduct of individual and group review sessions, as appropriate. When  time or other factors preclude the convening of a peer review panel,  mail reviews will be used.   For competitive programs, mail reviews will be used only where the  Administrator makes a written determination of necessity.</p>
