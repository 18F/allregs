                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DO rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery against unrated orders. Similarly, DX rated orders must be given preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders.</p><p class="depth2">Examples: If a person receives a DO rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX rated order. However, if business operations cannot be altered to meet both the June 3 and July 15 delivery dates, then the DX rated order must be given priority over the DO rated order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conflicting rated orders. (1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person shall give preference to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting rated orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall give preference to those orders which have the earliest receipt dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person shall give preference to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting rated orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall give preference to those orders which have the earliest receipt dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts under this section, the person

should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in subpart H of this part. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in subpart H of this part. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in Sec. 700.13(d)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in Sec. 700.17(b).
