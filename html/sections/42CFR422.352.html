An organization is considered a PSO for purposes of a MA contract if the organization--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has obtained a waiver of State licensure as provided for under Sec. 422.370;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meets the definition of a PSO set forth in Sec. 422.350 and other applicable requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is effectively controlled by the provider or, in the case of a group, by one or more of the affiliated providers that established and operate the PSO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provision of services. A PSO must demonstrate to CMS's satisfaction that it is capable of delivering to Medicare enrollees the range of services required under a contract with CMS. Each PSO must deliver a substantial proportion of those services directly through the provider or the affiliated providers responsible for operating the PSO. Substantial proportion means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a non-rural PSO, not less than 70% of Medicare services covered under the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a rural PSO, not less than 60% of Medicare services covered under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rural PSO. To qualify as a rural PSO, a PSO must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Demonstrate to CMS that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It has available in the rural area, as defined in Sec. 412.62(f) of this chapter, routine services including but not limited to primary care, routine specialty care, and emergency services; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The level of use of providers outside the rural area is consistent with general referral patterns for the area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enroll Medicare beneficiaries, the majority of which reside in the rural area the PSO serves.
