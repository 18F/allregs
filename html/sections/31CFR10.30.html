                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Advertising and solicitation restrictions. (1) A practitioner may not, with respect to any Internal Revenue Service matter, in any way use or participate in the use of any form of public communication or private solicitation containing a false, fraudulent, or coercive statement or claim; or a misleading or deceptive statement or claim. Enrolled agents, enrolled retirement plan agents, or registered tax return preparers, in describing their professional designation, may not utilize the term ``certified'' or imply an employer/employee relationship with the Internal Revenue Service. Examples of acceptable descriptions for enrolled agents are ``enrolled to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service,'' ``enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service,'' and

``admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.'' Similarly, examples of acceptable descriptions for enrolled retirement plan agents are ``enrolled to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service as a retirement plan agent'' and ``enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service as a retirement plan agent.'' An example of an acceptable description for registered tax return preparers is ``designated as a registered tax return preparer by the Internal Revenue Service.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A practitioner may not make, directly or indirectly, an uninvited written or oral solicitation of employment in matters related to the Internal Revenue Service if the solicitation violates Federal or State law or other applicable rule, e.g., attorneys are precluded from making a solicitation that is prohibited by conduct rules applicable to all attorneys in their State(s) of licensure. Any lawful solicitation made by or on behalf of a practitioner eligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service must, nevertheless, clearly identify the solicitation as such and, if applicable, identify the source of the information used in choosing the recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fee information. (1)(i) A practitioner may publish the availability of a written schedule of fees and disseminate the following fee information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Fixed fees for specific routine services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Hourly rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Range of fees for particular services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Fee charged for an initial consultation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any statement of fee information concerning matters in which costs may be incurred must include a statement disclosing whether clients will be responsible for such costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A practitioner may charge no more than the rate(s) published under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for at least 30 calendar days after the last date on which the schedule of fees was published.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Communication of fee information. Fee information may be communicated in professional lists, telephone directories, print media, mailings, electronic mail, facsimile, hand delivered flyers, radio, television, and any other method. The method chosen, however, must not cause the communication to become untruthful, deceptive, or otherwise in violation of this part. A practitioner may not persist in attempting to contact a prospective client if the prospective client has made it known to the practitioner that he or she does not desire to be solicited. In the case of radio and television broadcasting, the broadcast must be recorded and the practitioner must retain a recording of the actual transmission. In the case of direct mail and e-commerce communications, the practitioner must retain a copy of the actual communication, along with a list or other description of persons to whom the communication was mailed or otherwise distributed. The copy must be retained by the practitioner for a period of at least 36 months from the date of the last transmission or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Improper associations. A practitioner may not, in matters related to the Internal Revenue Service, assist, or accept assistance from, any person or entity who, to the knowledge of the practitioner, obtains clients or otherwise practices in a manner forbidden under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable beginning August 2, 2011.
