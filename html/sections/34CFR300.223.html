                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An SEA may require an LEA to establish its eligibility  jointly with another LEA if the SEA determines that the LEA will be  ineligible under this subpart because the agency will not be able to  establish and maintain programs of sufficient size and scope to  effectively meet the needs of children with disabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charter school exception. An SEA may not require a charter  school that is an LEA to jointly establish its eligibility under  paragraph (a) of this section unless the charter school is explicitly  permitted to do so under the State's charter school statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of payments. If an SEA requires the joint establishment  of eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section, the total amount of  funds made available to the affected LEAs must be equal to the sum of  the payments that each LEA would have received under Sec. 300.705 if the  agencies were eligible for those payments.  (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(e)(1) and (2))</p>
