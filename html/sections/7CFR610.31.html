Under the CPGL Program, NRCS will  provide technical assistance to landowners and managers who request  assistance based on locally-established priorities and resource  concerns. The purpose of the CPGL Program is to provide technical  assistance to private grazing land owners and managers to voluntarily  conserve or enhance grazing land resources to meet ecological, economic,  and social demands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term ``private grazing land'' means private, State-owned,  tribally owned, and any other non-federally owned rangeland,  pastureland, grazed forestland, hayland, and other lands used for  grazing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The NRCS Chief may implement the CPGL Program in any of the 50  States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the  U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. NRCS will provide assistance in  cooperation with conservation districts, or directly to a landowner or  operator.</p>
