(i) Each employee shall be trained in, and familiar with, the safety-related work practices, safety procedures, and other safety requirements in this subpart that pertain to his or her job assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each employee shall be trained in, and familiar with, the safety-related work practices, safety procedures, and other safety requirements in this subpart that pertain to his or her job assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each employee shall also be trained in and familiar with any other safety practices, including applicable emergency procedures (such as pole-top and manhole rescue), that are not specifically addressed by this subpart but that are related to his or her work and are necessary for his or her safety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The degree of training shall be determined by the risk to the employee for the hazard involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified employees. Each qualified employee shall also be trained and competent in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The skills and techniques necessary to distinguish exposed live parts from other parts of electric equipment,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The skills and techniques necessary to determine the nominal voltage of exposed live parts,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The minimum approach distances specified in this subpart corresponding to the voltages to which the qualified employee will be exposed and the skills and techniques necessary to maintain those distances,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The proper use of the special precautionary techniques, personal protective equipment, insulating and shielding materials, and insulated tools for working on or near exposed energized parts of electric equipment, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The recognition of electrical hazards to which the employee may be exposed and the skills and techniques necessary to control or avoid these hazards.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(2): For the purposes of this subpart, a person must have the training required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section to be considered a qualified person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Supervision and annual inspection. The employer shall determine, through regular supervision and through inspections conducted on at least an annual basis, that each employee is complying with the safety-related work practices required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Additional training. An employee shall receive additional training (or retraining) under any of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the supervision or annual inspections required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section indicate that the employee is not complying with the safety-related work practices required by this subpart, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If new technology, new types of equipment, or changes in procedures necessitate the use of safety-related work practices that are different from those which the employee would normally use, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If he or she must employ safety-related work practices that are not normally used during his or her regular job duties.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (b)(4)(iii): The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers tasks that are performed less often than once per year to necessitate retraining before the performance of the work practices involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Type of training.
