                                Sec. 75.501  Audit requirements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Audit required. A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Single audit. A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 75.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Program-specific audit election. When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&D;) and the Federal program's statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with Sec. 75.507. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&D; unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $750,000. A non-Federal entity that expends less than $750,000 during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards is exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in Sec. 75.503, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC). Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subrecipients and contractors. An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. Section 75.351 sets forth the considerations in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Compliance responsibility for contractors. In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal

award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For-profit subrecipient. Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits. See also Sec. 75.352.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Recipients and subrecipients that are commercial organizations (including for-profit hospitals) have two options regarding audits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> A financial related audit (as defined in the Government Auditing Standards, GPO Stock 020-000-00-265-4) of a particular award in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, in those cases where the recipient receives awards under only one HHS program; or, if awards are received under multiple HHS programs, a financial related audit of all HHS awards in accordance with Government Auditing Standards; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> An audit that meets the requirements contained in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Commercial organizations that receive annual HHS awards totaling less than $750,000 are exempt from requirements for a non-Federal audit for that year, but records must be available for review by appropriate officials of Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> See also Sec. 75.215.</p>
