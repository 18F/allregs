                            <p class="depth0">As a recipient, you must implement appropriate mechanisms to ensure  compliance with the requirements of this part by all participants in the  program. You must include in your concession program the specific  provisions to be inserted into concession agreements and management  contracts setting forth the enforcement mechanisms and other means you  use to ensure compliance. These provisions must include a monitoring and  enforcement mechanism to verify that the work committed to ACDBEs is  actually performed by the ACDBEs. This mechanism must include a written  certification that you have reviewed records of all contracts, leases,  joint venture agreements, or other concession-related agreements and  monitored the work on-site at your airport for this purpose. The  monitoring to which this paragraph refers may be conducted in  conjunction with monitoring of concession performance for other  purposes.  [77 FR 36931, June 20, 2012]</p>
