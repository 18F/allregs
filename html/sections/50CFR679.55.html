                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Responsibility. The owner of a shoreside processor or a  stationary floating processor named on a Federal Processing Permit (FPP)  or a person named on a Registered Buyer permit at the time of the  landing subject to the observer fee as specified at paragraph (c) of  this section must comply with the requirements of this section.  Subsequent non-renewal of an FPP or a Registered Buyer permit does not  affect the permit holder's liability for noncompliance with this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Observer fee liability determination. After each fishing year,  the Regional Administrator will mail an observer fee liability invoice  to each permit holder specified in paragraph (a) of this section for  landings of groundfish and halibut subject to the observer fee. The  observer fee liability invoice will provide a summary of the round  pounds of groundfish and headed-and-gutted weight for halibut landed  during the previous fishing year for each permit by species, landing  port or port-group, and gear category. The total fee liability for each  permit holder will be determined by applying the observer fee percentage  in paragraph (f) of this section to the ex-vessel value of the  groundfish and halibut landings subject to the observer fee. The method  for determining the ex-vessel value of the groundfish and halibut  landings subject to the observer fee is provided in paragraph (e) of  this section. The fee liability will be assessed on the groundfish round  weight and the headed-and-gutted weight for halibut.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Landings subject to the observer fee. The observer fee is  assessed on landings by vessels not in the full observer coverage  category described at Sec. 679.51(a)(2) according to the following  table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Is fish from the landing subject to</p><p class="depth0">the observer fee?</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">If fish in the landing is from    If the vessel is    If the vessel is</p><p class="depth0">the following fishery or       not designated on   designated on an</p><p class="depth0">species:              an FFP or required  FFP or required to</p><p class="depth0">to be designated    be designated on</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Groundfish listed in Table    Not applicable, an  Yes.</p><p class="depth0">2a to this part that is           FFP is required</p><p class="depth0">harvested in the EEZ and          to harvest these</p><p class="depth0">subtracted from a total           groundfish in the</p><p class="depth0">allowable catch limit specified   EEZ.</p><p class="depth0">under Sec. 679.20(a).

NMFS will publish the  standard ex-vessel prices used to determine the observer fee in the  upcoming year in the Federal Register during the last quarter of each  calendar year. The standard ex-vessel prices will be described in U.S.  dollars per equivalent round pound for groundfish and per equivalent  headed-and-gutted weight for halibut.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective duration. The standard ex-vessel prices will remain in  effect until revised by subsequent publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Standard ex-vessel price determination and use--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Groundfish  standard ex-vessel prices. Except as described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)  of this section, NMFS will calculate groundfish standard ex-vessel  prices based on standardized ex-vessel nominal prices calculated using  information submitted in the Commercial Operator's Annual Report  described at Sec. 679.5(p) and the shoreside processor or stationary  floating processor landing report described at Sec. 679.5(e)(5), as  well as methods established by the State of Alaska's Commercial  Fisheries Entry Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Groundfish standard ex-vessel prices will be calculated as a 3- year rolling average of standard prices for each species, port or port- group, and gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gear categories for groundfish standard ex-vessel prices are:  Pelagic trawl gear, non-pelagic trawl gear, and non-trawl gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Halibut and fixed gear sablefish standard ex-vessel prices.  NMFS will use data submitted to NMFS on the IFQ Registered Buyer report  under Sec. 679.5(l)(7) to calculate the standard ex-vessel prices for  each year for halibut and fixed gear sablefish, by port or port group.  These standard ex-vessel prices will be applied to landings of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Halibut;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> IFQ sablefish; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sablefish accruing against the fixed-gear sablefish CDQ  allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Confidentiality. Standard ex-vessel prices will be aggregated  among ports if fewer than four processors participate in a price  category for any species and gear combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determining the ex-vessel value of groundfish and halibut. The  ex-vessel value of groundfish and halibut subject to the observer fee  will be determined by applying the standard ex-vessel price published in  the Federal Register in the year prior to the year in which the landing  was made to the round weight of groundfish and the headed-and-gutted  weight of halibut landings subject to the observer fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Observer fee percentage. The observer fee percentage is 1.25  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Fee collection. A permit holder specified in paragraph (a) of  this section, receiving a groundfish or halibut landing subject to the  observer fee under paragraph (c) of this section, is responsible for  collecting fees during the calendar year in which the groundfish or  halibut is received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payment due date. A permit holder specified in  paragraph (a) of this section must submit his or her observer fee  liability payment(s) to NMFS no later than February 15 of the year  following the calendar year in which the groundfish or halibut landings  subject to the observer fee were made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payment recipient. Make electronic payment payable to NMFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payment address. Payments must be made electronically through  the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov.  Instructions for electronic payment will be provided on the payment Web  site and on the observer fee liability invoice to be mailed to each  permit holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payment method. Payment must be made electronically in U.S.  dollars by automated clearinghouse, credit card, or electronic check  drawn on a U.S. bank account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Underpayment of fee liability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under Sec. 679.4, an  applicant will not receive a new or amended FPP or Registered Buyer  permit until he or she submits a complete permit application. For the  application to be considered complete, all fees required by NMFS must be  paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a permit holder fails to submit full payment for the  observer fee liability by the date described in paragraph (h)(1) of this  section, the Regional Administrator may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At any time thereafter send an initial administrative  determination to the liable permit holder stating that the permit  holder's estimated fee liability, as calculated by the Regional  Administrator and sent to the permit holder pursuant to paragraph (b) of  this section, is the amount of observer fee due from the permit holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Disapprove any issuance of an FPP or Registered Buyer permit to  the applicant in accordance with Sec. 679.4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If payment is not received by the 30th day after the final  agency action, the agency may pursue collection of the unpaid fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Overpayment of fee. Upon issuance of final agency action, any  amount submitted to NMFS in excess of the observer fee liability  determined to be due by the final agency action will be returned to the  permit holder unless the permit holder requests the agency to credit the  excess amount against the permit holder's future observer fee liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Appeals. A permit holder who receives an IAD may either pay the  fee liability or appeal the IAD pursuant to Sec. 679.43. In any appeal  of an IAD made under this section, a permit holder specified in  paragraph (a) of this section has the burden of proving his or her  claim.  [77 FR 70102, Nov. 21, 2012]</p>
