                                Sec.  4.1  Essentials of evaluative rating.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of  disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered  as a result of or incident to military service. The percentage ratings  represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment  in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their  residual conditions in civil occupations. Generally, the degrees of  disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for  considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses  proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. For  the application of this schedule, accurate and fully descriptive medical  examinations are required, with emphasis upon the limitation of activity  imposed by the disabling condition. Over a period of many years, a  veteran's disability claim may require reratings in accordance with  changes in laws, medical knowledge and his or her physical or mental  condition. It is thus essential, both in the examination and in the  evaluation of disability, that each disability be viewed in relation to  its history.  [41 FR 11292, Mar. 18, 1976]</p>
