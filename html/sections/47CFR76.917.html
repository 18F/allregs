                            <p class="depth0">A franchising authority that has been certified to regulate rates  may, at any time, notify the Commission that it no longer intends to  regulate basic cable rates. Such notification shall include the  franchising authority's determination that rate regulation no longer  serves the interests of cable subscribers served by the cable system  within the franchising authority's jurisdiction, and that it has  received no consideration for its withdrawal of certification. Such  notification shall be served on the cable operator. The Commission  retains the right to review such determinations and to request the  factual finding of the franchising authority underlying its decision to  withdraw certification. The franchising authority's withdrawal becomes  effective upon notification to the Commission.  [59 FR 17972, Apr. 15, 1994]</p>
