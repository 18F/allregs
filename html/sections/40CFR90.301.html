                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart describes the equipment required in order to  perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad spark-ignition engines and  vehicles subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part. Certain  text in this subpart is identified as pertaining to Phase 1 or Phase 2  engines. Such text pertains only to engines of the specified Phase. If  no indication of Phase is given, the text pertains to all engines,  regardless of Phase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test  engine is operated using a steady state test cycle on an engine  dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis  determining concentration of pollutant. Emission concentrations are  converted to mass emission rates in grams per hour based on either fuel  flow, fuel flow and engine intake air flow, or exhaust volume flow.  Weighted emission rates are reported as grams per brake-kilowatt hour  (g/kW-hr). See subpart E of this part for a complete description of the  test procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional information about system design, calibration  methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR  part 1065. Examples for system design, calibration methodologies, and so  forth, for dilute exhaust gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For Phase 2 Class I, Phase 2 Class I-B, and Phase 2 Class II  natural gas fueled engines, use the procedures of 40 CFR part 1065 to  measure nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) exhaust emissions from Phase 2  Class I, Phase 2 Class I-B, and Phase 2 Class II natural gas fueled  engines.
