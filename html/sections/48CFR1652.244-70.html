                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in section 1644.270, the following clause will be  inserted in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis  (experience-rated):</p><p class="depth0">Subcontracts (JUL 2005)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(7)</em>. Failure to provide advance notice may result in a  Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty in  the performance aspect of the carrier's service charge. In determining  whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given  subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold,  the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For initial advance notification, the carrier shall add the  total cost/price for the base year and all options, including quantity  or service options and option periods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For contract modifications, options and/or renewals (e.g.  evergreen contracts) not accounted for in paragraph (a)(1) of this  clause, the carrier shall provide advance notification if they cause the  total price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of  the modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original  subcontract will be required to perform the review. The $550,000  threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as  any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations  Act. All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed  the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215-2 ``Audit and  Records--Negotiations'' if based on cost analysis or 48 CFR 1646.301 and  1552.246-70 ``FEHB Inspection'' if based on price analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The advance notification required by paragraph (a) of this  clause will include the information specified below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of the proposed subcontractor and an explanation  of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the  competition obtained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proposed subcontract price and the carrier's cost or price  analysis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or  pricing data and a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data must be  submitted to the Contracting officer if required by law, regulation, or  other contract provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A negotiation memorandum reflecting--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The most significant consideration controlling establishment of  initial or revised prices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An explanation of the reason cost or pricing data are not  required, if the carrier believes that cost or pricing data are not  required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent, if any, to which the carrier did not rely on the  subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective  and in negotiating the final price;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The extent, if any, to which it was recognized in the  negotiation that the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not  accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by the carrier and the  subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total  price negotiated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The reasons for any significant difference between the  carrier's price objective and the price negotiated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan,  when incentives are used. The explanation will identify each critical  performance element, management decisions used to quantify each  incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all  trade-off possibilities considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The carrier will obtain the Contracting officer's written  consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is  required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting  officer may ratify in writing any such subcontract for which written  consent was not obtained. Ratification will constitute the consent of  the Contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contracting officer may waive the requirement for advance  notification and consent required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this  clause where the carrier and subcontractor submit an application or  renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR subpart 9.6  and--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting officer evaluated the arrangement during  negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The subcontractor's price and/or costs were included in the  Plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting officer  during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the carrier follows the notification and consent requirements  of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this clause and subsequently obtains  the Contracting officer's consent or ratification, then the  reasonableness of the subcontract's costs will be inferred as provided  for in 1631.205-81. However, consent or ratification by the Contracting  officer will not constitute a determination:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the carrier should be relieved of any responsibility for  performing this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No subcontract placed under this contract will provide for  payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under  cost reimbursement type subcontracts will not exceed the fee limitations   in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i). Any profit or fee payable under a subcontract  will be in accordance with the provision of Section 3.7, Service Charge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The carrier will give the Contracting officer immediate written  notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any claim made  against the carrier by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion  of the carrier, may result in litigation related in any way to this  contract with respect to which the carrier may be entitled to  reimbursement from the Government.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [70 FR 31383, June 1, 2005, as amended at 71 FR 3016, Jan. 19, 2006]</p>
