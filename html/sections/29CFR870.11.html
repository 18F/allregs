                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> Section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act provides that the restrictions in section 303(a) do not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act provides that the restrictions in section 303(a) do not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any debt due for any State or Federal tax, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any order of any court of bankruptcy under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accordingly the Consumer Credit Protection Act does not restrict in any way the amount which may be withheld for State or Federal taxes or in Chapter XIII Bankruptcy Act proceedings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> Section 303(b) provides the following restrictions on the amount that may be withheld for the support of any person (e.g. alimony or child support):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 303(b) provides the following restrictions on the amount that may be withheld for the support of any person (e.g. alimony or child support):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Where such individual is supporting his spouse or dependent child (other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support such order is issued), 50 per centum of such individual's disposable earnings for that week; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where such individual is not supporting such a spouse or dependent child described in clause (A), 60 per centum of such individual's disposable earnings for that week; except that, with respect to the disposable earnings of any individual for any workweek, the 50 per centum specified in clause (A) shall be deemed to be 55 per centum and the 60 per centum specified in clause (B) shall be

deemed to be 65 per centum, if and to the extent that such earnings are subject to garnishment to enforce a support order with respect to a period which is prior to the twelve week period which ends with the beginning of such workweek.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with the provisions of section 303(a) and (b) may offer problems when there is more than one garnishment. In that event the priority is determined by State law or other Federal laws as the CCPA contains no provisions controlling the priorities of garnishments. However, in no event may the amount of any individual's disposable earnings which may be garnished exceed the percentages specified in section 303. To illustrate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If 45% of an individual's disposable earnings were garnished for taxes, and this garnishment has priority, the Consumer Credit Protection Act permits garnishment for the support of any person of only the difference between 45% and the applicable percentage (50 to 65%) in the above quoted section 303(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If 70% of an individual's disposable earnings were garnished for taxes and/or a Title XIII Bankruptcy debt, and these garnishments have priority, the Consumer Credit Protection Act does not permit garnishment either for the support of any person or for other debts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If 25% of an individual's disposable earnings were withheld pursuant to an ordinary garnishment which is subject to the restrictions of section 303(a), and the garnishment has priority in accordance with State law, the Consumer Credit Protection Act permits the additional garnishment for the support of any person of only the difference between 25% and the applicable percentage (50-65%) in the above quoted section 303(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If 25% or more of an individual's disposable earnings were withheld pursuant to a garnishment for support, and the support garnishment has priority in accordance with State law, the Consumer Credit Protection Act does not permit the withholding of any additional amounts pursuant to an ordinary garnishment which is subject to the restrictions of section 303(a).
