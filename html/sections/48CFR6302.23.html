                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hearings are as informal as may be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. At the hearing the parties may offer such relevant evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, subject, however, to the sound discretion of the presiding Administrative Judge in supervising the extent and manner of presenting the evidence. In general, admissibility is governed by relevancy and materiality. Copies of documents, affidavits, or other evidence not ordinarily admissible under judicial rules or evidence, may be admitted in the discretion of the presiding Administrative Judge. The weight to be attached to evidence presented in any particular form is within the discretion of the Board, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the particular case. Stipulations of fact agreed upon by the parties may be used as evidence at the hearing. The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness if the witness were present. In any case, the Board may require evidence in addition to that offered by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Witnesses before the Board are examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the facts are stipulated, or the Board otherwise orders.</p>
