                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary will pay a servicer in tiers one, two, or three an  incentive payment for each of the following successful loss-mitigation  options or alternatives to foreclosure completed: repayment plans,  special forbearance agreements, loan modifications, compromise sales,  and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Only one incentive payment will be  made with respect to any default required to be reported to the  Secretary pursuant to Sec. 36.4317(c). No incentive payment will be  made to a servicer in tier four. The options and alternatives are listed  in paragraph (b) of this section from top to bottom in their preferred  order of consideration (i.e., a hierarchy for review), but VA recognizes  that individual circumstances may lead to ``out of the ordinary''  considerations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The amount of the incentive payment is as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Tier ranking                              One          Two         Three         Four ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Repayment Plan..............................................         $200         $160         $120           $0 Special Forbearance.........................................          200          160          120            0 Loan Modification...........................................          700          500          300            0 Compromise Sale.............................................        1,000          800          600            0 Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure.................................          350          250          150            0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, a loss-mitigation option or  alternative to foreclosure will be deemed successfully completed as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to a repayment plan (as defined in Sec. 36.4301),  when the loan reinstates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to special forbearance (as defined in Sec.  36.4301), when the loan reinstates.
