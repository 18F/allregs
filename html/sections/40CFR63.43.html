                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to an owner or operator who constructs or reconstructs a major source of HAP subject to a case-by-case determination of maximum achievable control technology pursuant to Sec. 63.42(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for constructed and reconstructed major sources. When a case-by-case determination of MACT is required by Sec. 63.42(c), the owner and operator shall obtain from the permitting authority an approved MACT determination according to one of the review options contained in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review options. (1) When the permitting authority requires the owner or operator to obtain, or revise, a permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act before construction or reconstruction of the major source, or when the permitting authority allows the owner or operator at its discretion to obtain or revise such a permit before construction or reconstruction, and the owner or operator elects that option, the owner or operator shall follow the administrative procedures in the program approved under title V of the Act (or in other regulations issued pursuant to title V of the Act, where applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the permitting authority requires the owner or operator to obtain, or revise, a permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act before construction or reconstruction of the major source, or when the permitting authority allows the owner or operator at its discretion to obtain or revise such a permit before construction or reconstruction, and the owner or operator elects that option, the owner or operator shall follow the administrative procedures in the program approved under title V of the Act (or in other regulations issued pursuant to title V of the Act, where applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an owner or operator is not required to obtain or revise a title V permit (or other permit issued pursuant to title V of the Act) before construction or reconstruction, the owner or operator (unless the owner or operator voluntarily follows the process to obtain a title V permit) shall either, at the discretion of the permitting authority:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Apply for and obtain a Notice of MACT Approval according to the procedures outlined in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Apply for a MACT determination under any other administrative procedures for preconstruction review and approval established by the permitting authority for a State or local jurisdiction which provide for public participation in the determination, and ensure that no person may begin actual construction or reconstruction of a major source in that State or local jurisdiction unless the permitting authority determines that the MACT emission limitation for new sources will be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When applying for a permit pursuant to title V of the Act, an owner or operator may request approval of case-by-case MACT determinations for alternative operating scenarios. Approval of such determinations satisfies the requirements of section 112(g) of each such scenario.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Regardless of the review process, the MACT emission limitation and requirements established shall be effective as required by paragraph (j) of this section, consistent with the principles established in paragraph (d) of this section, and supported by the information listed in paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, and with all applicable requirements in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Principles of MACT determinations. The following general principles shall govern preparation by the owner or operator of each permit application or other application requiring a case-by-case MACT determination concerning

construction or reconstruction of a major source, and all subsequent review of and actions taken concerning such an application by the permitting authority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The MACT emission limitation or MACT requirements recommended by the applicant and approved by the permitting authority shall not be less stringent than the emission control which is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based upon available information, as defined in this subpart, the MACT emission limitation and control technology (including any requirements under paragraph (d)(3) of this section) recommended by the applicant and approved by the permitting authority shall achieve the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of HAP which can be achieved by utilizing those control technologies that can be identified from the available information, taking into consideration the costs of achieving such emission reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements associated with the emission reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant may recommend a specific design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or a combination thereof, and the permitting authority may approve such a standard if the permitting authority specifically determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission limitation under the criteria set forth in section 112(h)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrator has either proposed a relevant emission standard pursuant to section 112(d) or section 112(h) of the Act or adopted a presumptive MACT determination for the source category which includes the constructed or reconstructed major source, then the MACT requirements applied to the constructed or reconstructed major source shall have considered those MACT emission limitations and requirements of the proposed standard or presumptive MACT determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application requirements for a case-by-case MACT determination. (1) An application for a MACT determination (whether a permit application under title V of the Act, an application for a Notice of MACT Approval, or other document specified by the permitting authority under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall specify a control technology selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the MACT emission limitation or standard as determined according to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application for a MACT determination (whether a permit application under title V of the Act, an application for a Notice of MACT Approval, or other document specified by the permitting authority under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall specify a control technology selected by the owner or operator that, if properly operated and maintained, will meet the MACT emission limitation or standard as determined according to the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In each instance where a constructed or reconstructed major source would require additional control technology or a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name and address (physical location) of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A brief description of the major source to be constructed or reconstructed and identification of any listed source category or categories in which it is included;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The expected commencement date for the construction or reconstruction of the major source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The expected completion date for construction or reconstruction of the major source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> the anticipated date of start-up for the constructed or reconstructed major source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The HAP emitted by the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the estimated emission rate for each such HAP, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Any federally enforceable emission limitations applicable to the constructed or reconstructed major source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The maximum and expected utilization of capacity of the constructed or reconstructed major source, and the associated uncontrolled emission rates for that source, to the extent this information is needed by the permitting authority to determine MACT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The controlled emissions for the constructed or reconstructed major source in tons/yr at expected and maximum utilization of capacity, to the extent this information is needed by

the permitting authority to determine MACT;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> A recommended emission limitation for the constructed or reconstructed major source consistent with the principles set forth in paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> The selected control technology to meet the recommended MACT emission limitation, including technical information on the design, operation, size, estimated control efficiency of the control technology (and the manufacturer's name, address, telephone number, and relevant specifications and drawings, if requested by the permitting authority);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Supporting documentation including identification of alternative control technologies considered by the applicant to meet the emission limitation, and analysis of cost and non-air quality health environmental impacts or energy requirements for the selected control technology; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Any other relevant information required pursuant to subpart A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In each instance where the owner or operator contends that a constructed or reconstructed major source will be in compliance, upon startup, with case-by-case MACT under this subpart without a change in control technology, the application for a MACT determination shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(x) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documentation of the control technology in place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Administrative procedures for review of the Notice of MACT Approval.
