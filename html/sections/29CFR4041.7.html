                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Suspension upon formal challenge to termination--(1) Notice of formal challenge. (i) If the PBGC is advised, before its review period under Sec. 4041.26(a) ends, or before issuance of a notice of inability to determine sufficiency or a distribution notice under Sec. 4041.47(b) or (c), that a formal challenge to the termination has been initiated as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the PBGC will suspend the termination proceeding and so advise the plan administrator in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of formal challenge. (i) If the PBGC is advised, before its review period under Sec. 4041.26(a) ends, or before issuance of a notice of inability to determine sufficiency or a distribution notice under Sec. 4041.47(b) or (c), that a formal challenge to the termination has been initiated as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the PBGC will suspend the termination proceeding and so advise the plan administrator in writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the PBGC is advised, before its review period under Sec. 4041.26(a) ends, or before issuance of a notice of inability to determine sufficiency or a distribution notice under Sec. 4041.47(b) or (c), that a formal challenge to the termination has been initiated as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the PBGC will suspend the termination proceeding and so advise the plan administrator in writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the PBGC is advised of a challenge described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section after the time specified therein, the PBGC may suspend the termination proceeding and will so advise the plan administrator in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standard terminations. During any period of suspension in a standard termination--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The running of all time periods specified in ERISA or this part relevant to the termination will be suspended; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan administrator must comply with the prohibitions in Sec. 4041.22.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distress terminations. During any period of suspension in a distress termination--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The issuance by the PBGC of any notice of inability to determine sufficiency or distribution notice will be stayed or, if any such notice was previously issued, its effectiveness will be stayed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The plan administrator must comply with the prohibitions in Sec. 4041.42; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The plan administrator must file a distress termination notice with the PBGC pursuant to Sec. 4041.45.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing collective bargaining agreement. For purposes of this section, an existing collective bargaining agreement means a collective bargaining agreement that has not been made inoperative by a judicial ruling and, by its terms, either has not expired or is extended beyond its stated expiration date because neither of the collective bargaining parties took the required action to terminate it. When a collective bargaining agreement no longer meets these conditions, it ceases to be an ``existing collective bargaining agreement,'' whether or not any or all of its terms may continue to apply by operation of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formal challenge to termination. A formal challenge to a plan termination asserting that the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement is initiated when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any procedure specified in the collective bargaining agreement for resolving disputes under the agreement commences; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any action before an arbitrator, administrative agency or board, or court under applicable labor-management relations law commences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Resolution of challenge. Immediately upon the final resolution of the challenge, the plan administrator must notify the PBGC in writing of the outcome of the challenge, provide the PBGC with a copy of any award or order, and, if the validity of the proposed termination has been upheld, advise the PBGC whether the proposed termination is to proceed. The final resolution ends the suspension period under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Challenge sustained. If the final resolution is that the proposed termination violates an existing collective bargaining agreement, the PBGC will dismiss the termination proceeding, all actions taken to effect the plan termination will be null and void, and the plan will be an ongoing plan. In this event, in a distress termination, Sec. 4041.42(d) will apply as of the date of the dismissal by the PBGC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Termination sustained. If the final resolution is that the proposed termination does not violate an existing collective bargaining agreement and the plan administrator has notified the PBGC that the termination is to proceed, the PBGC will reactivate the termination proceeding by sending a written notice thereof to the plan administrator, and--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The termination proceeding will continue from the point where it was suspended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All actions taken to effect the termination before the suspension will be effective;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any time periods that were suspended will resume running from the date of the PBGC's notice of the reactivation of the proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any time periods that had fewer than 15 days remaining will be extended to the 15th day after the date of the PBGC's notice, or such later date as the PBGC may specify; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In a distress termination, the PBGC will proceed to issue a notice of inability to determine sufficiency or a distribution notice (or reactivate any such notice stayed under paragraph (a)(3) of this section), either with or

without first requesting updated information from the plan administrator pursuant to Sec. 4041.45(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Final resolution of challenge. A formal challenge to a proposed termination is finally resolved when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parties involved in the challenge enter into a settlement that resolves the challenge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A final award, administrative decision, or court order is issued that is not subject to review or appeal; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A final award, administrative decision, or court order is issued that is not appealed, or review or enforcement of which is not sought, within the time for filing an appeal or requesting review or enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Involuntary termination by the PBGC. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the PBGC retains the authority in any case to initiate a plan termination in accordance with the provisions of section 4042 of ERISA.</p>
