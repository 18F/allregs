The due diligence program required by this section shall be  a part of the anti-money laundering program otherwise required by this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum requirements. The due diligence program required by  paragraph (a) of this section shall be designed to ensure, at a minimum,  that the financial institution takes reasonable steps to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ascertain the identity of all nominal and beneficial owners of a  private banking account;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ascertain whether any person identified under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section is a senior foreign political figure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ascertain the source(s) of funds deposited into a private  banking account and the purpose and expected use of the account; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Review the activity of the account to ensure that it is  consistent with the information obtained about the client's source of  funds, and with the stated purpose and expected use of the account, as  needed to guard against money laundering, and to report, in accordance  with applicable law and regulation, any known or suspected money  laundering or suspicious activity conducted to, from, or through a  private banking account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special requirements for senior foreign political figures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  In the case of a private banking account for which a senior foreign  political figure is a nominal or beneficial owner, the due diligence  program required by paragraph (a) of this section shall include enhanced  scrutiny of such account that is reasonably designed to detect and  report transactions that may involve the proceeds of foreign corruption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term proceeds of foreign  corruption means any asset or property that is acquired by, through, or  on behalf of a senior foreign political figure through misappropriation,  theft, or embezzlement of public funds, the unlawful conversion of  property of a foreign government, or through acts of bribery or  extortion, and shall include any other property into which any such  assets have been transformed or converted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special procedures when due diligence cannot be performed. The  due diligence program required by paragraph (a) of this section shall  include procedures to be followed in circumstances in which a covered  financial institution cannot perform appropriate due diligence with  respect to a private banking account, including when the covered  financial institution should refuse to open the account, suspend  transaction activity, file a suspicious activity report, or close the  account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicability rules. The provisions of this section apply to  covered financial institutions as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rules--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Private banking accounts established on or  after July 5, 2006.
