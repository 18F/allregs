                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BOP pressure tests. When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each component. You must conduct the low-pressure test before the high-pressure test. For purposes of this section, BOP system components include ram-type BOP's, related control equipment, choke and kill lines, and valves, manifolds, strippers, and safety valves. Surface BOP systems must be pressure tested with water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Low pressure tests. You must successfully test all BOP system components to a low pressure between 200 and 300 psi. Any initial pressure equal to or greater than 300 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero before starting the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> High pressure tests. You must successfully test all BOP system components to the rated working pressure of the BOP equipment, or as otherwise approved by the BSEE District Manager.

You must successfully test the annular-type BOP at 70 percent of its rated working pressure or as otherwise approved by the BSEE District Manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other testing requirements. You must test variable bore pipe rams against the largest and smallest sizes of tubulars in use (jointed pipe, seamless pipe) in the well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must test the BOP systems at the following times:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When installed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least every 7 days, alternating between control stations and at staggered intervals to allow each crew to operate the equipment. If either control system is not functional, further operations must be suspended until the nonfunctional system is operable. The test every 7 days is not required for blind or blind-shear rams. The blind or blind-shear rams must be tested at least once every 30 days during operation. A longer period between blowout preventer tests is allowed when there is a stuck pipe or pressure-control operation and remedial efforts are being performed. The tests must be conducted as soon as possible and before normal operations resume. The reason for postponing testing must be entered into the operations log. The BSEE District Manager may require alternate test frequencies if conditions or BOP performance warrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following repairs that require disconnecting a pressure seal in the assembly, the affected seal will be pressure tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All personnel engaged in well abandonment operations must participate in a weekly BOP drill to familiarize crew members with appropriate safety measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may conduct a stump test for the BOP system on location. A plan describing the stump test procedures must be included in your Application for Permit to Modify, Form BSEE-0124, and must be approved by the BSEE District Manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must test the coiled tubing connector to a low pressure of 200 to 300 psi, followed by a high pressure test to the rated working pressure of the connector or the expected surface pressure, whichever is less. You must successfully pressure test the dual check valves to the rated working pressure of the connector, the rated working pressure of the dual check valve, expected surface pressure, or the collapse pressure of the coiled tubing, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must record test pressures during BOP and coiled tubing tests on a pressure chart, or with a digital recorder, unless otherwise approved by the BSEE District Manager. The test interval for each BOP system component must be 5 minutes, except for coiled tubing operations, which must include a 10 minute high-pressure test for the coiled tubing string. Your representative at the facility must certify that the charts are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The time, date, and results of all pressure tests, actuations, inspections, and crew drills of the BOP system, system components, and marine risers must be recorded in the operations log. The BOP tests must be documented in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The documentation must indicate the sequential order of BOP and auxiliary equipment testing, the pressure, and duration of each test. As an alternate, the documentation in the operations log may reference a BOP test plan that contains the required information and is retained on file at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The control station used during the test must be identified in the operations log. For a subsea system, the pod used during the test must be identified in the operations log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any problems or irregularities observed during BOP and auxiliary equipment testing and any actions taken to remedy such problems or irregularities, must be noted in the operations log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documentation required to be entered in the operations log may instead be referenced in the operations log. You must make all records including pressure charts, operations log, and referenced documents pertaining to BOP tests, actuations, and inspections, available for BSEE review at the facility for the duration of well abandonment activity. Following completion of the well abandonment activity, you must retain all such records for a period of two years at the facility, at the

lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility, or at another location conveniently available to the BSEE District Manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Stump test a subsea BOP system before installation. You must use water to conduct this test. You may use drilling fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system. You must stump test the subsea BOP within 30 days of the initial test on the seafloor. You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. Each ROV must be fully compatible with the BOP stack ROV intervention panels. You must also test and verify closure of at least one set of rams during the initial test on the seafloor. You must submit test procedures, including how you will test each ROV function, with your APM for BSEE District Manager approval. You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams and one set of blind-shear rams and unlatching the LMRP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system and verify closure of at least one set of blind-shear rams during the initial test on the seafloor. When you conduct the initial deadman system test on the seafloor you must ensure the well is secure and, if hydrocarbons have been present, appropriate barriers are in place to isolate hydrocarbons from the wellhead. You must also have an ROV on bottom during the test. You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit test procedures with your APM for BSEE District Manager approval. The procedures for these function tests must include documentation of the controls and circuitry of the system utilized during each test. The procedure must also describe how the ROV will be utilized during this operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Document the results of each test and make them available to BSEE upon request.
