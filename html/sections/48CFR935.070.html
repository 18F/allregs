                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The DOE research misconduct policy set forth at 10 CFR part 733 addresses research misconduct by individuals who propose, perform or review research of any kind for the Department of Energy pursuant to a contract. The regulation applies regardless of where the research or other activity is conducted or by whom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition. Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion. A finding of research misconduct means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred, including a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.
