Sec.  435.840 and 435.843.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the agency chooses this option, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agency must provide Medicaid to the following individuals who meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All pregnant women during the course of their pregnancy who, except for income and resources, would be eligible for Medicaid as mandatory or optional categorically needy under subparts B or C of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All individuals under 18 years of age who, except for income and resources, would be eligible for Medicaid as mandatory categorically needy under subpart B of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All newborn children born on or after October 1, 1984, to a woman who is eligible as medically needy and is receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth.

provided, regardless of changes in the woman's financial circumstances that may occur within this extended period. These women are eligible for the extended period for all services under the plan that are pregnancy-related (as defined in Sec.  440.210(c)(1) of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agency may provide Medicaid to any of the following groups of individuals;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Individuals under age 21 (Sec.  435.308).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specified relatives (Sec.  435.310).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Aged (Sec.
