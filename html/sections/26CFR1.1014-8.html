Assume that, under the will of a decedent, property consisting of common stock with a value of $1,000 at the time of the decedent's death is transferred in trust, to pay the income to A for life, remainder to B or to B's estate. B predeceases A and bequeaths the remainder interest to C. Assume that B dies on January 1, 1956, and that the value of the stock originally transferred is $1,600 at B's death. A's age at that time is 37. The value of the remainder interest included in B's estate is $547 (0.34185, remainder factor age 37, x$1,600), and hence $547 is C's basis for the remainder interest immediately after B's death. Assume that C sells the remainder interest on January 1, 1961, when A's age is 42. C's basis for the remainder interest at the time of such sale is $596, computed as follows:

Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that C does not sell the remainder interest. Upon A's death terminating the trust, C's basis for the stock distributed to him is computed as follows:
Uniform basis of the property, adjusted to date of termination    $1,000</p><p class="depth2">of the trust.................................................</p><p class="depth2">plusValue of remainder interests in the property at the       $547</p><p class="depth2">time of B's death..................................</p><p class="depth2">lessB's share of uniform basis of the property at the          342</p><p class="depth2">time of his death..................................</p><p class="depth2">------       205</p><p class="depth2">---------C's basis for the stock distributed to him upon the                1,205</p><p class="depth2">termination of the trust.....................................</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the property transferred is depreciable. Assume further that $100 of depreciation was allowed prior to B's death and that $50 of depreciation is allowed between the time of B's death and the termination of the trust. Upon A's death terminating the trust, C's basis for the property distributed to him is computed as follows:
Uniform basis of the property, adjusted to date of</p><p class="depth2">termination of the trust:</p><p class="depth2">Uniform basis immediately after decedent's death..    $1,000</p><p class="depth2">Depreciation allowed following decedent's death...       150</p><p class="depth2">----------</p><p class="depth2">........      $350</p><p class="depth2">plusValue of remainder interest in the property at the         547</p><p class="depth2">time of B's death..................................</p><p class="depth2">lessB's share of uniform basis of the property at the          308</p><p class="depth2">time of his death (0.34185x$900, uniform basis at</p><p class="depth2">B's death).........................................</p><p class="depth2">----------</p><p class="depth2">------       239</p><p class="depth2">---------C's basis for the property distributed to him upon the             1,089</p><p class="depth2">termination of the trust.....................................</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rules stated in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply where the basis of the remainder interest in the hands of the remainderman's transferee is determined by reference to its cost to such transferee. See also paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1014-4. Thus, if, in example (1) of paragraph (b) of this section B sold his remainder interest to C for $547 in cash, C's basis for the stock distributed to him upon the death of A terminating the trust is $547.</p>
