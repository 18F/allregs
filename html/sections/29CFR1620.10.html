                                Sec. 1620.10  Meaning of ``wages.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the EPA, the term ``wages'' generally includes all payments  made to [or on behalf of] an employee as remuneration for employment.  The term   includes all forms of compensation irrespective of the time of payment,  whether paid periodically or deferred until a later date, and whether  called wages, salary, profit sharing, expense account, monthly minimum,  bonus, uniform cleaning allowance, hotel accommodations, use of company  car, gasoline allowance, or some other name. Fringe benefits are deemed  to be remuneration for employment. ``Wages'' as used in the EPA (the  purpose of which is to assure men and women equal remuneration for equal  work) will therefore include payments which may not be counted under  section 3(m) of the FLSA toward the minimum wage (the purpose of which  is to assure employees a minimum amount of remuneration unconditionally  available in cash or in board, lodging or other facilities). Similarly,  the provisions of section 7(e) of the FLSA under which some payments may  be excluded in computing an employee's ``regular rate'' of pay for  purposes of section 7 do not authorize the exclusion of any such  remuneration from the ``wages'' of an employee in applying the EPA.  Thus, vacation and holiday pay, and premium payments for work on  Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, regular days of rest or other days or  hours in excess or outside of the employee's regular days or hours of  work are deemed remuneration for employment and therefore wage payments  that must be considered in applying the EPA, even though not a part of  the employee's ``regular rate.''</p>
