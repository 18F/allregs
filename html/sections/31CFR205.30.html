                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Federal Program Agency must designate an official  representative to coordinate all interaction with us and the States  concerning this subpart A, and must notify us in writing of the  representative's name and title. A Federal Program Agency must notify us  immediately of any change in the official representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Federal Program Agency's implementation of this subpart A is  subject to review pursuant to procedural instructions that we issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We will consult with Federal agencies as necessary and  appropriate before entering into or amending a Treasury-State agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will distribute Annual Reports to Federal agencies, as set  forth in Sec. 205.26. Upon our request, a Federal Program Agency must  review a State's Annual Report for reasonableness and must report its  findings to us within 30 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A Federal Program Agency must notify us in writing if the  program agency has knowledge, at any time, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State's clearance pattern does not correspond to a Federal  assistance program's clearance activity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corrective action needs to be taken by a State, us, or another  Federal Program Agency, with respect to the implementation of this  subpart. We will notify the State or Federal Program Agency as  appropriate in writing with a description of the Federal Program  Agency's assertion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A Federal Program Agency must notify us in writing of new  Federal assistance programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a Federal Program Agency causes an interest liability by  failing to comply with this subpart A, we may collect a charge from the  Federal Program Agency. A Federal interest liability resulting from  circumstances beyond the control of a Federal Program Agency does not  constitute noncompliance. We will determine the charge using the  following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will issue a Notice of Assessment to the Federal Program  Agency, indicating the nature of the noncompliance, the amount of the  charge, the manner in which it was calculated, and the right to file an  appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the maximum extent practicable, a Federal Program Agency must  pay a charge for noncompliance out of appropriations available for the  Federal Program Agency's operations and not from the Federal Program  Agency's program funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a Federal Program Agency does not pay a charge for  noncompliance within 45 days after receiving a Notice of Assessment, we  will debit the appropriate Federal Program Agency account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event a Federal Program Agency appeals a charge imposed  under the Notice of Assessment, we will defer the charge until we decide  the appeal. If we deny the appeal, the effective date of the charge may  be retroactive to the date indicated in the Notice of Assessment.</p>
