                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Compensation of board members, executive officers, and employees of an Enterprise shall not be in excess of that which is reasonable and appropriate, shall be commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of such persons, shall be consistent with the long-term goals of the Enterprise, shall not focus solely on earnings performance, but shall take into account risk management, operational stability and legal and regulatory compliance as well, and shall be undertaken in a manner that complies with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursement. If an Enterprise is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Enterprise, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Enterprise shall reimburse the Enterprise as provided under section 304 of the SOA, as amended from time to time. This provision does not otherwise limit the authority of OFHEO to employ remedies available to it under its enforcement authorities.
