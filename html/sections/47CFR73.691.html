                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each TV station must have measuring equipment for determining that the transmitted visual signal conforms to the provisions of this subpart. The licensee shall decide the monitoring and measurement methods or procedures for indicating and controlling the visual signal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event technical problems make it impossible to operate in accordance with the timing and carrier level tolerance requirements of Sec.  73.682 (a)(9)(i), (a)(9)(ii), (a)(12), (a)(13), and (a)(17), a TV broadcast station may operate at variance for a period of not more than 30 days without specific authority from the FCC: provided that, the date and time of the initial out-of-tolerance condition has been entered in the station log. If the operation at variance will exceed 10 consecutive days, a notification must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C., not later than the 10th day of such operation. In the event normal operation is resumed prior to the end of the 30 day period, the licensee must notify the FCC upon restoration of normal operation. If causes beyond the control of the licensee prevent restoration of normal operation within 30 days, a written request must be made to the FCC in Washington, D.C., no later than the 30th day for such additional time as may be necessary.
