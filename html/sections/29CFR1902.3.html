                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General.

The plan shall contain assurances  that any other responsibilities of the designated agency shall not  detract significantly from the resources and priorities assigned to  administration of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State agency or agencies must be designated with overall  responsibility for administering the plan throughout the State. However,  political subdivisions of the State may have the responsibility and  authority for the development and enforcement of standards, provided  that the State agency or agencies are given adequate authority by  statute, regulation, or agreement, to insure that the commitments of the  State under the plan will be fulfilled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State plan shall include or provide for the  development or adoption of, and contain assurances that the State will  continue to develop or adopt, standards which are or will be at least as  effective as those promulgated under section 6 of the Act. Indices of  the effectiveness of standards and procedures for the development or  adoption of standards against which the Assistant Secretary will measure  the State plan in determining whether it is approvable are set forth in  Sec. 1902.4(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Act, is  interpreted as not being applicable to customized products or parts not  normally available on the open market, or to the optional parts or  additions to products which are ordinarily available with such optional  parts or additions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enforcement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State plan shall provide a program for the  enforcement of the State standards which is, or will be, at least as  effective as that provided in the Act, and provide assurances that the  State's enforcement program will continue to be at least as effective as  the Federal program. Indices of the effectiveness of a State's  enforcement plan against which the Assistant Secretary will measure the  State plan in determining whether it is approvable are set forth in  Sec. 1902.4(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State plan shall require employers to comply with all  applicable State occupational safety and health standards covered by the  plan and all applicable rules issued thereunder, and employees to comply  with all standards, rules, and orders applicable to their conduct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right of entry and inspection. The State plan shall contain  adequate assurance that inspectors will have a right to enter and  inspect covered workplaces which is, or will be, at least   as effective as that provided in section 8 of the Act. Where such entry  or inspection is refused, the State agency or agencies shall have the  authority, through appropriate legal process, to compel such entry and  inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prohibition against advance notice. The State plan shall contain  a prohibition against advance notice of inspections. Any exceptions must  be expressly authorized by the head of the designated agency or agencies  or his representative and such exceptions may be no broader than those  authorized under the Act and the rules published in part 1903 of this  chapter relating to advance notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Legal authority. The State plan shall contain satisfactory  assurances that the designated agency or agencies have, or will have,  the legal authority necessary for the enforcement of its standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Personnel. The State plan shall provide assurance that the  designated agency or agencies have, or will have, a sufficient number of  adequately trained and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement  of the standards. For this purpose qualified personnel means persons  employed on a merit basis, including all persons engaged in the  development of standards and the administration of the State plan.  Conformity with the Standards for a Merit System of Personnel  Administration, 45 CFR part 70, issued by the Secretary of Labor,  including any amendments thereto, and any standards prescribed by the  U.S. Civil Service Commission pursuant to section 208 of the  Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-648; 84 Stat. 1915)  modifying or superseding such standards, will be deemed to meet this  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Resources. The State plan shall contain satisfactory assurances  through the use of budget, organizational description, and any other  appropriate means that the State will devote adequate funds to the  administration and enforcement of the program. The Assistant Secretary  will make periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the State resources  devoted to the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> State and local government employees. The State plan shall  include, to the extent permitted by State law, an effective and  comprehensive occupational safety and health program covering all  employees of public agencies of the State and its political  subdivisions. Such program shall be as effective as the programs  contained in the plan which are applicable to employees covered by the  plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Employer records and reports. The State plan shall provide  assurances that employers covered by the plan will maintain records and  make reports to the Assistant Secretary in the same manner and to the  same extent as if the plan were not in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> State agency reports to the Assistant Secretary. The State plan  shall provide assurances that the designated agency or agencies shall  make such reasonable reports to the Assistant Secretary in such form and  containing such information as he may from time to time require. The  agency or agencies shall establish specific goals, consistent with the  goals of the Act, including measures of performance, output and results  which will determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the State  program, and shall make periodic reports to the Assistant Secretary on  the extent to which the State, in implementation of its plan, has  attained these goals. Reports will also include data and information on  the implementation of the specific inspection and voluntary compliance  activities included within the State plan. Further, these reports shall  contain such statistical information pertaining to work-related deaths,  injuries, and illnesses in employments and places of employment covered  by the plan as the Assistant Secretary may from time to time require.
