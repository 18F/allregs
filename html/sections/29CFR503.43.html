                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party desiring review of a determination issued under Sec.  503.41, including judicial review, must make a request for such an  administrative hearing in writing to the Chief ALJ at the address stated  in the notice of determination. In such a proceeding, the Administrator  will be the plaintiff, and the party will be the respondent. If such a  request for an administrative hearing is timely filed, the  Administrator, WHD's determination will be inoperative unless and until  the case is dismissed or the ALJ issues an order affirming the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No particular form is prescribed for any request for hearing  permitted by this section. However, any such request will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be dated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be typewritten or legibly written;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the issue or issues stated in the notice of  determination giving rise to such request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State the specific reason or reasons why the party believes such  determination is in error;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Be signed by the party making the request or by the agent or  attorney of such party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Include the address at which such party or agent or attorney  desires to receive further communications relating thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The request for such hearing must be received by the Chief ALJ,  at the address stated in the Administrator, WHD's notice of  determination, no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the  determination. A party which fails to meet this 30-day deadline for  requesting a hearing may thereafter participate in the proceedings only  by consent of the ALJ.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The request may be filed in person, by facsimile transmission,  by certified or regular mail, or by courier service within the time set  forth in paragraph (c) of this section. For the requesting party's  protection, if the request is by mail, it should be by certified mail.  If the request is by facsimile transmission, the original of the  request, signed by the party or its attorney or agent, must be filed  within 25 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The determination will take effect on the start date identified  in the written notice of determination, unless an administrative appeal  is properly filed. The timely filing of an administrative appeal stays  the determination pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Copies of the request for a hearing will be sent by the party or  attorney or agent to the WHD official who issued the notice of  determination on behalf of the Administrator, WHD, and to the  representative(s) of the Solicitor of Labor identified in the notice of  determination.</p><p class="depth2">Rules of Practice</p>
