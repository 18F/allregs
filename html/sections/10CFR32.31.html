The probabilities have been expressed in general terms to  emphasize the approximate nature of the estimates that are to be made.  The following values may be used as guides in estimating compliance with  the criteria: Low--not more than one such failure/incident per year for  each 10,000 exempt units distributed. Negligible--not more than one such  failure/incident per year for each one million exempt units distributed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An applicant for a license under Sec. 32.30 shall demonstrate  that, even in unlikely scenarios of misuse, including those resulting in  direct exposure to the unshielded source removed from the device for  1,000 hours at an average distance of 1 meter and those resulting in  dispersal and subsequent intake of   10-4 of the quantity of byproduct material (or in the case of  tritium, an intake of 10 percent), a person will not receive an external  radiation dose or committed dose in excess of 100 mSv (10 rem), and, if  the unshielded source is small enough to fit in a pocket, that the dose  to localized areas of skin averaged over areas no larger than 1 square  centimeter from carrying the unshielded source in a pocket for 80 hours  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- will not exceed 2 Sv (200 rem).
