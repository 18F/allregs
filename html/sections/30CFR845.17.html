The Office shall consider any information so submitted  in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the  penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Office shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment and of  the work sheet showing the computation of the proposed assessment on the  person to whom the notice or order was issued, by certified mail, or by  any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a  summons or complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice or order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a copy of the proposed assessment and work sheet or the  certified mail is tendered at the address of that person required under  30 CFR 816.11, or at any address at which that person is in fact  located, and he or she refuses to accept delivery of or to collect such  documents, the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed to have  been complied with upon such tender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure by the Office to serve any proposed assessment within 30  days shall not be grounds for dismissal of all or part of such  assessment unless the person against whom the proposed penalty has been  assessed--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Proves actual prejudice as a result of the delay; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Makes a timely objection to the delay. An objection shall be  timely only if made in the normal course of administrative review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless a conference has been requested, the Office shall review  and reassess any penalty if necessary to consider facts which were not  reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment  because of the length of the abatement period. The Office shall serve a  copy of any such reassessment and of the worksheet showing the  computation of the reassessment in the manner provided in paragraph (b),  within 30 days after the date the violation is abated.
