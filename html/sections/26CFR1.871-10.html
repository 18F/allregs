                                Sec. 1.871-10  Election to treat real property income as effectively
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, the election may not be made.  But if an election has been properly made under this section for a  taxable year, the election remains in effect, unless properly revoked,  for subsequent taxable years even though during any such subsequent  taxable year there is no income from the real property, or interest  therein, in respect of which the election applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.871-8 applies to  his gains derived from the sale of real property located in the United  States and held for the production of income, even though such income  would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not  been made. In further illustration, assume that a nonresident alien  individual not engaged in trade or business, or present, in the United  States during the taxable year has income from sources within the United  States consisting of oil royalties, rentals from a former personal  residence, and capital gain from the sale of another residence held for  the production of income. If he makes an election under this section, it  will apply with respect to his royalties, rentals, and capital gain,  even though such capital gain would not be subject to tax under section  871(a) if the election had not been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income not included. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, income from real property, or from any interest in real  property, does not include (i) interest on a debt obligation secured by  a mortgage of real property, (ii) any portion of a dividend, within the  meaning of section 316, which is paid by a corporation or a trust, such  as a real estate investment trust described in section 857, which  derives income from real property, (iii) in the case of a nonresident  alien individual, income from real property, such as a personal  residence, which is not held for the production of income or from any  transaction in such property which was not entered into for profit, (iv)  rentals from personal property, or royalties from intangible personal  property, within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, or  (v) income which, without regard to section 871(d) or 882(d) and this  section, is treated as income which is effectively connected for the  taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United  States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rules applicable to personal property. For purposes of  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, in the case of a sales agreement, or  rental or royalty agreement, affecting both real and personal property,  the income from the transaction is to be allocated between the real  property and the personal property in proportion to their respective  fair market values unless the agreement specifically provides otherwise.  In the case of such a rental or royalty agreement, the respective fair  market values are to be determined as of the time the agreement is  signed. In making determinations of this subparagraph, the principles of  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.48-1, relating to the definition of ``section  38 property,'' apply for purposes of determining whether property is  tangible or intangible personal property and of paragraph (a)(5) of  Sec. 1.1245-1 apply for purposes of making the allocation of income  between real and personal property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1441-4, as income which is  effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade  or business in the United States by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 1.871-8, as a gain or loss which is effectively  connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business  in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manner of making or revoking an election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election, or  revocation, without consent of Commissioner--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A  nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation may, for the first  taxable year for which the election under this section is to apply, make  the initial election at any time before the expiration of the period  prescribed by section 6511(a), or by section 6511(c) if the period for  assessment is extended by agreement, for filing a claim for credit or  refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for such taxable  year. This election may be made without the consent of the Commissioner.  Having made the initial election, the taxpayer may, within the time  prescribed for making the election for such taxable year, revoke the  election without the consent of the Commissioner. If the revocation is  timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make his initial election  under this section for a later taxable year without the consent of the  Commissioner. If the taxpayer revokes the initial election without the  consent of the Commissioner he must file amended income tax returns, or  claims for credit or refund, where applicable, for the taxable years to  which the revocation applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statement to be filed with return. An election made under this  section without the consent of the Commissioner shall be made for a  taxable year by filing with the income tax return required under section  6012 and the regulations thereunder for such taxable year a statement to  the effect that the election is being made. This statement shall include  (a) a complete schedule of all real property, or any interest in real  property, of which the taxpayer is titular or beneficial owner, which is  located in the United States, (b) an indication of the extent to which  the taxpayer has direct or beneficial ownership in each such item of  real property, or interest in real property, (c) the location of the  real property or interest therein, (d) a description of any substantial  improvements on any such property, and (e) an identification of any  taxable year or years in respect of which a revocation or new election  under this section has previously occurred. This statement may not be  filed with any return under section 6851 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exemption from withholding of tax. For statement to be filed  with a withholding agent at the beginning of a taxable year in respect  of which an election under this section is to be made, see paragraph (a)  of Sec. 1.1441-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revocation, or election, with consent of Commissioner--(i) In  general. If the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation  makes the initial election under this section for any taxable year and  the period prescribed by subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this paragraph for  making the election for such taxable year has expired, the election  shall remain in effect for all subsequent taxable years, including  taxable years for which the taxpayer realizes no income from real  property, or from any interest therein, or for which he is not required  under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder to file an income tax  return. However, the election may be revoked in accordance with  subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for any subsequent taxable year  with the consent of the Commissioner. If the election for any such  taxable year is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, the  taxpayer may not make a new election before his fifth taxable year which  begins after the first taxable year for which the revocation is  effective unless consent is given to such new election by the  Commissioner in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of new election. A new election made for the fifth  taxable year, or taxable year thereafter, without the consent of the  Commissioner, and a new election made with the consent of the  Commissioner, shall be treated as an initial election to which  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Written request required. A request to revoke an election made  under this section when such revocation requires the consent of the  Commissioner, or to make a new election when such election requires the  consent of the Commissioner, shall be made in writing and shall be  addressed to the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue  Service, Washington, DC 20225. The request shall include the name and  address of the taxpayer and shall be signed by the taxpayer or his duly  authorized representative. It must specify the taxable year for which  the revocation or new election is to be effective and shall be filed  within 75 days after the close of the first taxable year for which it is  desired to make the change. The request must specify the grounds which  are considered to justify the revocation or new election. The Director  of International Operations may require such other information as may be  necessary in order to determine whether the proposed change will be  permitted. A copy of the consent by the Director of International  Operations shall be attached to the taxpayer's return required under  section 6012 and the regulations thereunder for the taxable year for  which the revocation or new election is effective. A copy of such  consent may not be filed with any return under section 6851 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Election by partnership. If a non-resident alien individual or  foreign corporation is a member of a partnership which has income  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section from real property, any  election to be made under this section in respect of such income shall  be made by the partners and not by the partnership. A nonresident   alien or foreign corporation that makes an election generally must  provide the partnership a Form W-8ECI, ``Certificate of Foreign Person's  Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income Effectively Connected  with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States,'' and  attach to such form a copy of the election (or a statement that  indicates that the nonresident alien or foreign corporation will make  the election). However, if the nonresident alien or foreign corporation  has already submitted a valid form to the partnership that establishes  such partner's foreign status, the partner shall furnish the partnership  a copy of the election (or a statement that indicates that the  nonresident alien or foreign corporation will make the election). To the  extent the partnership has income to which the election pertains, the  partnership shall treat such income as effectively connected income  subject to withholding under section 1446. See also Sec. 1.1446-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective dates. This section shall apply for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1966, except the last four sentences of  paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply to partnership taxable  years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the  regulations under Sec. Sec. 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason  of an election under Sec. 1.1446-7. There are no corresponding rules in  this part for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967.  [T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44222, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended by T.D. 9200, 70 FR  28717, May 18, 2005]</p>
