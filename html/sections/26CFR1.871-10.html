                                Sec. 1.871-10  Election to treat real property income as effectively
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When election may be made. A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation which during the taxable year derives any income from real property which is located in the United States and, in the case of a nonresident alien individual, held for the production of income, or derives income from any interest in any such property, may elect, pursuant to section 871(d) or 882(d) and this section, to treat all such income as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that taxpayer. The election may be made whether or not the taxpayer is engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year for which the election is made or whether or not the taxpayer has income from real property which for the taxable year is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, but it may be made only with respect to that income from sources within the United States which, without regard to this section, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer. If for the taxable year the taxpayer has no income from real property located in the United States, or from any interest in such property, which is subject to the tax imposed by section 871(a) or 881(a), the election may not be made. But if an election has been properly made under this section for a taxable year, the election remains in effect, unless properly revoked, for subsequent taxable years even though during any such subsequent taxable year there is no income from the real property, or interest therein, in respect of which the election applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Income to which the election applies--(1) Included income. An election under this section shall apply to all income from real property which is located in the United States and, in the case of a nonresident alien individual, held for the production of income, and to all income derived from any interest in such property, including (i) gains from the sale or exchange of such property or an interest therein, (ii) rents or royalties from mines, oil or gas wells, or other natural resources, and (iii) gains described in section 631 (b) or (c), relating to treatment of gain on the disposal of timber, coal, or iron ore with a retained economic interest. The election may not be made with respect to only one class of such income. For

purposes of the election, income from real property, or from any interest in real property, includes any amount included under section 652 or 662 in the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is the beneficiary of an estate or trust if, by reason of the application of section 652(b) or 662(b), and the regulations thereunder, such amount has the character in the hands of that beneficiary of income from real property, or from any interest in real property. It is immaterial that no tax would be imposed on the income by section 871(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.871-7, or by section 881(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.881-2, if the election were not in effect. Thus, for example, if an election under this section has been made by a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, the tax imposed by section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.871-8 applies to his gains derived from the sale of real property located in the United States and held for the production of income, even though such income would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not been made. In further illustration, assume that a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business, or present, in the United States during the taxable year has income from sources within the United States consisting of oil royalties, rentals from a former personal residence, and capital gain from the sale of another residence held for the production of income. If he makes an election under this section, it will apply with respect to his royalties, rentals, and capital gain, even though such capital gain would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Included income. An election under this section shall apply to all income from real property which is located in the United States and, in the case of a nonresident alien individual, held for the production of income, and to all income derived from any interest in such property, including (i) gains from the sale or exchange of such property or an interest therein, (ii) rents or royalties from mines, oil or gas wells, or other natural resources, and (iii) gains described in section 631 (b) or (c), relating to treatment of gain on the disposal of timber, coal, or iron ore with a retained economic interest. The election may not be made with respect to only one class of such income. For

purposes of the election, income from real property, or from any interest in real property, includes any amount included under section 652 or 662 in the gross income of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is the beneficiary of an estate or trust if, by reason of the application of section 652(b) or 662(b), and the regulations thereunder, such amount has the character in the hands of that beneficiary of income from real property, or from any interest in real property. It is immaterial that no tax would be imposed on the income by section 871(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.871-7, or by section 881(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.881-2, if the election were not in effect. Thus, for example, if an election under this section has been made by a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, the tax imposed by section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.871-8 applies to his gains derived from the sale of real property located in the United States and held for the production of income, even though such income would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not been made. In further illustration, assume that a nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business, or present, in the United States during the taxable year has income from sources within the United States consisting of oil royalties, rentals from a former personal residence, and capital gain from the sale of another residence held for the production of income. If he makes an election under this section, it will apply with respect to his royalties, rentals, and capital gain, even though such capital gain would not be subject to tax under section 871(a) if the election had not been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income not included. For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, income from real property, or from any interest in real property, does not include (i) interest on a debt obligation secured by a mortgage of real property, (ii) any portion of a dividend, within the meaning of section 316, which is paid by a corporation or a trust, such as a real estate investment trust described in section 857, which derives income from real property, (iii) in the case of a nonresident alien individual, income from real property, such as a personal residence, which is not held for the production of income or from any transaction in such property which was not entered into for profit, (iv) rentals from personal property, or royalties from intangible personal property, within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, or (v) income which, without regard to section 871(d) or 882(d) and this section, is treated as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rules applicable to personal property. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, in the case of a sales agreement, or rental or royalty agreement, affecting both real and personal property, the income from the transaction is to be allocated between the real property and the personal property in proportion to their respective fair market values unless the agreement specifically provides otherwise. In the case of such a rental or royalty agreement, the respective fair market values are to be determined as of the time the agreement is signed. In making determinations of this subparagraph, the principles of paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.48-1, relating to the definition of ``section 38 property,'' apply for purposes of determining whether property is tangible or intangible personal property and of paragraph (a)(5) of Sec. 1.1245-1 apply for purposes of making the allocation of income between real and personal property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of the election--(1) Determination of tax. The income to which, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, an election under this section applies shall be subject to tax in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, provided by section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.871-8, or by section 882(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.882-1. For purposes of determining such tax for the taxable year, income to which the election applies shall be aggregated with all other income of the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that taxpayer. To the

extent that deductions are connected with income from real property to which the election applies, they shall be treated for purposes of section 873(a) or section 882(c)(1) as connected with income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. An election under this section does not cause a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, which is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, to be treated as though such taxpayer were engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year. Thus, for example, the compensation received during the taxable year for services performed in the United States in a previous taxable year by a nonresident alien individual, who has an election in effect for the taxable year under this section but is engaged in trade or business in the United States at no time during the taxable year, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. In further illustration, gain for the taxable year from the casual sale of personal property described in section 1221(I) derived by a nonresident alien individual who is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year but has an election in effect for such year under this section is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See Sec. 1.864-3. If an election under this section is in effect for the taxable year, the income to which the election applies shall be treated, for purposes of section 871(b)(1) or section 882(a)(1), section 1441(c)(1), and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1441-4, as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination of tax. The income to which, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, an election under this section applies shall be subject to tax in the manner, and subject to the same conditions, provided by section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.871-8, or by section 882(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.882-1. For purposes of determining such tax for the taxable year, income to which the election applies shall be aggregated with all other income of the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that taxpayer. To the

extent that deductions are connected with income from real property to which the election applies, they shall be treated for purposes of section 873(a) or section 882(c)(1) as connected with income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. An election under this section does not cause a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, which is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, to be treated as though such taxpayer were engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year. Thus, for example, the compensation received during the taxable year for services performed in the United States in a previous taxable year by a nonresident alien individual, who has an election in effect for the taxable year under this section but is engaged in trade or business in the United States at no time during the taxable year, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. In further illustration, gain for the taxable year from the casual sale of personal property described in section 1221(I) derived by a nonresident alien individual who is not engaged in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year but has an election in effect for such year under this section is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See Sec. 1.864-3. If an election under this section is in effect for the taxable year, the income to which the election applies shall be treated, for purposes of section 871(b)(1) or section 882(a)(1), section 1441(c)(1), and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1441-4, as income which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of property to which election applies. Any real property, or interest in real property, with respect to which an election under this section applies shall be treated as a capital asset which, if depreciable, is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167 and the regulations thereunder. Such property, or interest in property, shall be treated as property not used in a trade or business for purposes of applying any provisions of the Code, such as section 172(d)(4)(A), relating to gain or loss attributable to a trade or business for purposes of determining a net operating loss; section 1221(2), relating to property not constituting a capital asset; or section 1231(b), relating to special rules for treatment of gains and losses. For example, if a nonresident alien individual makes the election under this section and, while the election is in effect, sells unimproved land which is located in the United States and held for investment purposes, any gain or loss from the sale shall be considered gain or loss from the sale of a capital asset and shall be treated, for purposes of determining the tax under section 871(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.871-8, as a gain or loss which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manner of making or revoking an election--(1) Election, or revocation, without consent of Commissioner--(i) In general. A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation may, for the first taxable year for which the election under this section is to apply, make the initial election at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6511(a), or by section 6511(c) if the period for assessment is extended by agreement, for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for such taxable year. This election may be made without the consent of the Commissioner. Having made the initial election, the taxpayer may, within the time prescribed for making the election for such taxable year, revoke the election without the consent of the Commissioner. If the revocation is timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make his initial election under this section for a later taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. If the taxpayer revokes the initial election without the consent of the Commissioner he must file amended income tax returns, or claims for credit or refund, where applicable, for the taxable years to which the revocation applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election, or revocation, without consent of Commissioner--(i) In general. A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation may, for the first taxable year for which the election under this section is to apply, make the initial election at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6511(a), or by section 6511(c) if the period for assessment is extended by agreement, for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for such taxable year. This election may be made without the consent of the Commissioner. Having made the initial election, the taxpayer may, within the time prescribed for making the election for such taxable year, revoke the election without the consent of the Commissioner. If the revocation is timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make his initial election under this section for a later taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. If the taxpayer revokes the initial election without the consent of the Commissioner he must file amended income tax returns, or claims for credit or refund, where applicable, for the taxable years to which the revocation applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation may, for the first taxable year for which the election under this section is to apply, make the initial election at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6511(a), or by section 6511(c) if the period for assessment is extended by agreement, for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for such taxable year. This election may be made without the consent of the Commissioner. Having made the initial election, the taxpayer may, within the time prescribed for making the election for such taxable year, revoke the election without the consent of the Commissioner. If the revocation is timely and properly made, the taxpayer may make his initial election under this section for a later taxable year without the consent of the Commissioner. If the taxpayer revokes the initial election without the consent of the Commissioner he must file amended income tax returns, or claims for credit or refund, where applicable, for the taxable years to which the revocation applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statement to be filed with return. An election made under this section without the consent of the Commissioner shall be made for a taxable year by filing with the income tax return required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder for such taxable year a statement to the effect that the election is being made. This statement shall include (a) a complete schedule of all real property, or any interest in real property, of which the taxpayer is titular or beneficial owner, which is located in the United States, (b) an indication of the extent to which the taxpayer has direct or beneficial ownership in each such item of real property, or interest in real property, (c) the location of the real property or interest therein, (d) a description of any substantial improvements on any such property, and (e) an identification of any taxable year or years in respect of which a revocation or new election under this section has previously occurred. This statement may not be filed with any return under section 6851 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exemption from withholding of tax. For statement to be filed with a withholding agent at the beginning of a taxable year in respect of which an election under this section is to be made, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1441-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Revocation, or election, with consent of Commissioner--(i) In general. If the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation makes the initial election under this section for any taxable year and the period prescribed by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for making the election for such taxable year has expired, the election shall remain in effect for all subsequent taxable years, including taxable years for which the taxpayer realizes no income from real property, or from any interest therein, or for which he is not required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder to file an income tax return. However, the election may be revoked in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for any subsequent taxable year with the consent of the Commissioner. If the election for any such taxable year is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may not make a new election before his fifth taxable year which begins after the first taxable year for which the revocation is effective unless consent is given to such new election by the Commissioner in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation makes the initial election under this section for any taxable year and the period prescribed by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph for making the election for such taxable year has expired, the election shall remain in effect for all subsequent taxable years, including taxable years for which the taxpayer realizes no income from real property, or from any interest therein, or for which he is not required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder to file an income tax return. However, the election may be revoked in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for any subsequent taxable year with the consent of the Commissioner. If the election for any such taxable year is revoked with the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may not make a new election before his fifth taxable year which begins after the first taxable year for which the revocation is effective unless consent is given to such new election by the Commissioner in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of new election. A new election made for the fifth taxable year, or taxable year thereafter, without the consent of the Commissioner, and a new election made with the consent of the Commissioner, shall be treated as an initial election to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Written request required. A request to revoke an election made under this section when such revocation requires the consent of the Commissioner, or to make a new election when such election requires the consent of the Commissioner, shall be made in writing and shall be addressed to the Director of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20225. The request shall include the name and address of the taxpayer and shall be signed by the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative. It must specify the taxable year for which the revocation or new election is to be effective and shall be filed within 75 days after the close of the first taxable year for which it is desired to make the change. The request must specify the grounds which are considered to justify the revocation or new election. The Director of International Operations may require such other information as may be necessary in order to determine whether the proposed change will be permitted. A copy of the consent by the Director of International Operations shall be attached to the taxpayer's return required under section 6012 and the regulations thereunder for the taxable year for which the revocation or new election is effective. A copy of such consent may not be filed with any return under section 6851 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Election by partnership. If a non-resident alien individual or foreign corporation is a member of a partnership which has income described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section from real property, any election to be made under this section in respect of such income shall be made by the partners and not by the partnership. A nonresident

alien or foreign corporation that makes an election generally must provide the partnership a Form W-8ECI, ``Certificate of Foreign Person's Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States,'' and attach to such form a copy of the election (or a statement that indicates that the nonresident alien or foreign corporation will make the election). However, if the nonresident alien or foreign corporation has already submitted a valid form to the partnership that establishes such partner's foreign status, the partner shall furnish the partnership a copy of the election (or a statement that indicates that the nonresident alien or foreign corporation will make the election). To the extent the partnership has income to which the election pertains, the partnership shall treat such income as effectively connected income subject to withholding under section 1446. See also Sec. 1.1446-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective dates. This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, except the last four sentences of paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall apply to partnership taxable years beginning after May 18, 2005, or such earlier time as the regulations under Sec. Sec. 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-5 apply by reason of an election under Sec. 1.1446-7. There are no corresponding rules in this part for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967.
