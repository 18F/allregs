                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing  is required by Sec. 28.615(c), reasonable notice shall be given by  registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected  applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or  recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision  under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the  matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice  within which the applicant or recipient may request of the designated  agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question  has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and  place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for  cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place  of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit  written information and argument for the record. The failure of an  applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been  set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under 20  U.S.C. 1682 and Sec. 28.615(c) and consent to the making of a decision  on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the  applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be  represented by counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures, evidence, and record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hearing, decision, and  any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with  5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and  in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not  inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing,  giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of  this   section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests  for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the  applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant  evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as  determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the  hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be  on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear  and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time  and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by these Title IX  regulations, may be reimbursed for his or her travel and actual expenses  of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the  standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on  official business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings  conducted pursuant to these Title IX regulations, but rules or  principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence  available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be  applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing  officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious  evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the  record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall  be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the  issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the  extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions  shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consolidated or Joint Hearings. In cases in which the same or  related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these Title  IX regulations with respect to two or more programs to which these Title  IX regulations apply, or noncompliance with these Title IX regulations  and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies  issued under Title IX, the designated agency official may, by agreement  with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for  the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application  to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with these  Title IX regulations. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as these  Title IX regulations are concerned, shall be made in accordance with  Sec. 28.625.  [65 FR 52883, Aug. 30, 2000]</p>
