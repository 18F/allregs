                            <p class="depth0">No mortgage shall be eligible for insurance unless the following  requirements are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Location of family unit. The family unit shall be located in a  project that the Commissioner determines to be acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Plan of condominium ownership. The project in which the unit is  located shall have been committed to a plan of condominium ownership by  a deed, or other recorded instrument, that is acceptable to the  Commissioner. In the case of condominium documents in the Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico, the Commissioner will accept documents presented for  inscription (recordation) to the Commonwealth Office of the Property  Registry so long as the mortgagor obtains a title insurance policy that  reflects the condominium regime.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Releases. The family unit shall have been released from any  mortgage covering the project or any part of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certificate by mortgagee. The mortgagee shall certify that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The deed of the family unit and the deed or other recorded  instrument committing the project to a plan of condominium ownership  must comply with legal requirements of the jurisdiction. In the case of  condominium documents in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Department  will accept documents presented for inscription (recordation) to the  Commonwealth Office of Property Registry for certification purposes so  long as the mortgagor obtains a title insurance policy that reflects the  condominium regime.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mortgagor has good marketable title to the family unit,  subject only to a mortgage that is a valid first lien on the family  unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The family unit is assessed and subject to assessment for taxes  pertaining only to that unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditions and provisions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commissioner may require such  conditions and provisions as the Commissioner determines are necessary  for the protection of consumers and the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An application for mortgage insurance of a unit will not be  approved if approval would result in less than 80 percent of the FHA- insured mortgages covering units in the project being occupied by  mortgagors or co-mortgagors as a principal residence or a secondary  residence (as these terms are defined in Sec. 203.18 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to the other requirements of this section, in order  for a project to be acceptable to the Secretary, at least 51 percent of  all family units (including units not covered by FHA-insured mortgages)  must be occupied by the owners as a principal residence or a secondary  residence (as these terms are defined in Sec. 203.18 of this chapter),  or must have been sold to owners who intend to meet this occupancy  requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Limitations on conversion of rental housing to condominium use.  With respect to a family unit in any project that was converted from  rental housing, no insurance will be provided under this section unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conversion occurred more than one year before the  application for insurance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The mortgagor or comortgagor was a tenant of a unit in the  rental housing project converted to condominium use; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The conversion of the property is sponsored by a bona fide  tenants' organization representing a majority of the households in the  project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Projects covered by an insured or Secretary-held mortgage. In  addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a) through (f) of  this section, projects which are covered by an FHA-insured project  mortgage, or by a mortgage held by the Secretary, must be in compliance  with a conversion plan approved by the Commissioner. The conversion plan  shall provide for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The termination by payment in full of the mortgage or by  voluntary termination of the insurance contract covering any HUD/FHA- insured or Secretary-held mortgage on the project, unless the  Commissioner determines that the Commissioner's interests, and those of  the individuals purchasing the family units, are best served by not  requiring the termination of the insurance or payment in full of the  mortgage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On release of a family unit from the project mortgage, payment  shall be made on the outstanding balance of the project mortgage in an  amount equal to the share of the balance determined by HUD to be  attributable to the family unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The project mortgagee shall certify that, notwithstanding any  provisions of the mortgage covering prepayment, no charge is  contemplated or has been collected for prepayment in full of the project  mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Projects not covered by an insured or Secretary-held mortgage.  In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a) through (f)  of this section, projects which are not covered by an insured project  mortgage or by a Secretary-held mortgage and which have not been  approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs for its guaranty,  insurance, or direct loan programs shall meet the requirements of this  paragraph. Except with the approval of the Commissioner for the purpose  of constructing or converting the project in phases or stages, any  special right of the declarant (as declarant and not as a unit owner) to  do any or all of the following must have expired or must have been  waived in a recorded instrument:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add land or units to the condominium;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Convert common elements into additional units or limited common  elements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Withdraw land from the condominium;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use easements through the common elements for the purpose of  making improvements within the condominium or within any adjacent land;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Convert a unit into two or more units, common elements, or into  two or more units and common elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h)  of this section, a loan on a single unit in an unapproved condominium  project (spot loan) may qualify for mortgage insurance under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All units, common elements, and facilities--including those that  are part of any master association--must have been completed, and the  project cannot be subject to additional phasing or annexation. The  project must provide for undivided ownership of common areas by unit  owners;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Control of the owners' association must have been turned over  to the unit purchasers, and the unit purchasers must have been in  control for at least one year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At least 90 percent of the total units in the project must  have been conveyed to the unit purchasers, and at least 51 percent of  the total units in the project must have been conveyed to purchasers who  are occupying the units as their principal residences or second homes.  No single entity (the same individual, investor group, partnership, or  corporation) may own more than 10   percent of the total units in the project;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The units in the project must be owned in fee simple or be an  eligible leasehold interest, as described in Sec. 234.65, and the unit  owners must have sole ownership interest in, and right to the use of,  the project's facilities, common elements, and limited common elements  including parking, recreational facilities, etc.;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The project must be covered by hazard, flood, and liability  insurance acceptable to the Commissioner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For projects with more than 30 units, no more than 10 percent  of the total units in the project may be encumbered by FHA-insured  mortgages. (If endorsement would result in more than 10 percent of the  units in such a project being encumbered by FHA-insured mortgages, the  condominium project must be approved under paragraphs (a) through (h) of  this section.) For projects with between 5 and 30 units inclusive, no  more than 20 percent of the total units may be encumbered by FHA-insured  mortgages. For projects with four units, only one unit may be encumbered  by an FHA-insured mortgage under the spot loan procedure of this  paragraph (i); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The assumability provisions of Sec. 234.66 must be satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lenders must perform an underwriting analysis and certify that a  project satisfies the eligibility criteria for a spot loan in a  condominium project that has not been approved by FHA. Lenders may use  information from the appraiser, the owners' association, the management  company, the real estate broker, and the project developer, but the  lender must ensure the accuracy of the information obtained from these  sources.
