                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of this section apply to the use of technology  covered by a valid patent when the patent holder is from a country that  is a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Article 1709(10) of NAFTA generally requires a user of  technology covered by a valid patent to make a reasonable effort to  obtain authorization prior to use of the patented technology. However,  NAFTA provides that this requirement for authorization may be waived in  situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme  urgency, or for public noncommercial use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 6 of Executive Order 12889, ``Implementation of the  North American Free Trade Act,'' of December 27, 1993, waives the  requirement to obtain advance authorization for an invention used or  manufactured by or for the Federal Government. However, the patent owner  shall be notified in advance whenever the agency or its contractor knows  or has reasonable grounds to know, without making a patent search, that  an invention described in and covered by a valid U.S. patent is or will  be used or manufactured without a license. In cases of national  emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, this notification  need not be made in advance, but shall be made as soon as reasonably  practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The contracting officer, in consultation with the office having  cognizance of patent matters, shall ensure compliance with the notice  requirements of NAFTA Article 1709(10) and Executive Order 12889. A  contract   award should not be suspended pending notification to the patent owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Section 6(c) of Executive Order 12889 provides that the notice  to the patent owner does not constitute an admission of infringement of  a valid privately-owned patent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When addressing issues regarding compensation for the use of  patented technology, Government personnel should be advised that NAFTA  uses the term ``adequate remuneration.'' Executive Order 12889 equates  ``remuneration'' to ``reasonable and entire compensation'' as used in 28  U.S.C. 1498, the statute that gives jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of  Federal Claims to hear patent and copyright cases involving infringement  by the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When questions arise regarding the notice requirements or other  matters relating to this section, the contracting officer should consult  with legal counsel.</p>
