                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An auxiliary antenna is one that is permanently installed and  available for use when the main antenna is out of service for repairs or  replacement. An auxiliary antenna may be located at the same transmitter  site as the station's main antenna or at a separate site. The service  contour of the auxiliary antenna may not extend beyond the following  corresponding contour for the main facility:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> AM stations: The 0.5 mV/m field strength contours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> FM stations: The 1.0 mV/m field strength contours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> TV stations: The Grade B coverage contours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Class A TV stations: The protected contours defined in Sec.   73.6010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An application for an auxiliary antenna for an AM station filed  pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section must contain a map  showing the 0.5 mV/m field strength contours of both the main and  auxiliary facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An application for a construction permit to install a new  auxiliary antenna, or to make changes in an existing auxiliary antenna  for which prior FCC authorization is required (see Sec.  73.1690), must  be filed on FCC Form 301 (FCC Form 340 for noncommercial educational  stations).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, the FM, TV or Class A TV licensee may  apply for the proposed auxiliary facility by filing a modification of  license application. The modified auxiliary facility must operate on the  same channel as the licensed main facility. An exhibit must be provided  with this license application to demonstrate compliance with Sec.   73.1675(a). All FM, TV and Class A TV licensees may request a decrease  from the authorized facility's ERP in the license application. An FM, TV  or Class A TV licensee may also increase the ERP of the auxiliary  facility in a license modification application, provided the application  contains an analysis demonstrating compliance with the Commission's  radiofrequency radiation guidelines, and an analysis showing that the  auxiliary facility will comply with Sec.  73.1675(a). Where an FM, TV,  or Class A TV licensee or permittee proposes to mount an auxiliary  facility on an AM tower, it must also demonstrate compliance with Sec.   1.30003 in the license application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where an AM licensee proposes to use a former licensed main  facility as an auxiliary facility with an ERP less than or equal to the  ERP specified on the former main license, the AM station may apply to  license the proposed auxiliary facility by filing a modification of  license application on Form 302-AM. The proposed auxiliary facilities  must have been previously licensed on the same frequency as the present  main facility. The license application must contain an exhibit to  demonstrate compliance with Sec.  73.1675(a).
