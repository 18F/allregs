                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Principle and scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)  and (a)(3) of this section, CMS establishes reasonable compensation  equivalency limits on the amount of compensation paid to physicians by  providers. These limits are applied to a provider's costs incurred in  compensating physicians for services to the provider, as described in  Sec. 415.55(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limits established under this section do not apply to costs of  physician compensation attributable to furnishing inpatient hospital  services that are paid for under the prospective payment system  implemented under part 412 of this chapter or to costs of physician  compensation attributable to approved GME programs that are payable  under Secs. 413.75 through 413.83 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compensation that a physician receives for activities that may  not be paid for under either Part A or Part B of Medicare is not  considered in applying these limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Methodology for establishing limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For cost reporting  periods beginning before January 1, 2015. CMS establishes a methodology  for determining annual reasonable compensation equivalency limits and,  to the extent possible, considers average physician incomes by specialty  and type of location using the best available data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,  2015. CMS establishes a methodology for determining annual reasonable  compensation equivalency limits and, to the extent possible, considers  average physician incomes by specialty using the best available data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application of limits. If the level of compensation exceeds the  limits established under paragraph (b) of this section, Medicare payment  is based on the level established by the limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustment of the limits. The intermediary may adjust limits  established under paragraph (b) of this section to account for costs  incurred by the physician or the provider related to malpractice  insurance, professional memberships, and continuing medical education.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the costs of membership in professional societies and  continuing medical education, the intermediary may adjust the limit by  the lesser of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual cost incurred by the provider or the physician for  these activities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Five percent of the appropriate limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the cost of malpractice expenses incurred by either the  provider or the physician, the intermediary may adjust the reasonable  compensation equivalency limit by the cost of the malpractice insurance  expense related to the physician service furnished to patients in  providers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exception to limits. An intermediary may grant a provider an  exception to the limits established under paragraph (b) of this section  only if the provider can demonstrate to the intermediary that it is  unable to recruit or maintain an adequate number of physicians at a  compensation level within these limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification of changes in methodologies and payment limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Before the start of a cost reporting period to which limits established  under this section will be applied, CMS publishes a notice in the  Federal Register that sets forth the amount of the limits and explains  how it calculated the limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If CMS proposes to revise the methodology for establishing  payment limits under this section, CMS publishes a notice, with  opportunity for public comment, in the Federal Register. The notice  explains the proposed basis and methodology for setting limits,  specifies the limits that would result, and states the date of  implementation of the limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If CMS updates limits by applying the most recent economic index  data without revising the limit methodology, CMS publishes the revised  limits in a notice in the Federal Register without prior publication of  a proposal or public comment period.
