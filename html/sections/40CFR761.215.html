                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manifest discrepancies are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Significant differences (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section) between the quantity or type of PCB waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity and type of PCB waste a facility actually receives; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rejected wastes, which may be a full or partial shipment of PCB waste that the designated facility cannot accept.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Significant differences in quantity are: For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight or variations greater than 10 percent in weight of PCB waste in containers; for batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one PCB Transformer or PCB Container or PCB Article Container in a truckload. Significant differences in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as the substitution of solids for liquids or the substitution of high concentration PCBs (above 500 ppm) with lower concentration materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon discovering a significant difference in quantity or type, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (e.g., with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Upon rejecting the PCB waste, the facility must consult with the generator prior to forwarding the waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to locate an alternative facility that can receive the waste, the facility may return the

rejected waste to the generator. The facility must send the waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the rejection identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon rejecting the PCB waste, the facility must consult with the generator prior to forwarding the waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to locate an alternative facility that can receive the waste, the facility may return the

rejected waste to the generator. The facility must send the waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the rejection identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> While the facility is making arrangements for forwarding rejected wastes to another facility under this section, it must ensure that either the delivering transporter retains custody of the waste, or, the facility must provide for secure, temporary custody of the waste, pending delivery of the waste to the first transporter designated on the manifest prepared under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, for full or partial load rejections that are to be sent off-site to an alternate facility, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with Sec. 761.207(a) and the following instructions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Write the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the generator's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the generator's site address, then write the generator's site address in the designated space for Item 5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Write the name of the alternate designated facility and the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a rejected waste from the previous shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Write the DOT description for the rejected load in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as the offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation, and mail a signed copy of the manifest to the generator identified in Item 5 of the new manifest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains present at the facility, the facility may forward the rejected shipment to the alternate facility by completing Item 18b of the original manifest and supplying the information on the next destination facility in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy of this manifest for its records, and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7) of this section, for rejected wastes that must be sent back to the generator, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with Sec. 761.207(a) and the following instructions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Write the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the facility's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the facility's site address, then write the facility's site address in the designated space for Item 5 of the new manifest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Write the name of the initial generator and the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a rejected waste from the previous shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Write the DOT description for the rejected load in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been

properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains at the facility, the facility may return the shipment to the generator with the original manifest by completing Item 18a and 18b of the manifest and supplying the generator's information in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy for its records and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (f)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For full or partial load rejections that are returned to the generator, the facility must also comply with the exception reporting requirements in Sec. 761.217(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a facility rejects a waste after it has signed, dated, and returned a copy of the manifest to the delivering transporter or to the generator, the facility must amend its copy of the manifest to indicate the rejected wastes in the discrepancy space of the amended manifest. The facility must also copy the manifest tracking number from Item 4 of the new manifest to the Discrepancy space of the amended manifest, and must re-sign and date the manifest to certify to the information as amended. The facility must retain the amended manifest for at least three years from the date of amendment, and must within 30 days, send a copy of the amended manifest to the transporter and generator that received copies prior to their being amended.
