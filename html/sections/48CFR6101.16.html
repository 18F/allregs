                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voluntary cooperation in lieu of subpoena. Each party is  expected to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cooperate by making available witnesses and evidence under its  control, when requested by another party, without issuance of a  subpoena; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secure the cooperation of third-party witnesses and production  of evidence by third parties, when practicable, without issuance of a  subpoena.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. Upon the written request of any party filed with the  Office of the Clerk of the Board, or upon the initiative of a judge, a  subpoena may be issued that commands the person to whom it is directed  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attend and give testimony at a deposition in a city or county  where that person resides or is employed or transacts business in  person, or at another location convenient to that person that is  specifically determined by the Board;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attend and give testimony at a hearing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Produce the books, papers, documents, electronically stored  information, and other tangible and intangible things designated in the  subpoena.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for subpoena. A request for a subpoena shall contain the  name of the assigned judge, the name of the case, and the docket number  of the case. It shall state the reasonable scope and general relevance  to the case of the testimony and of any evidence sought. A request for a  subpoena shall be filed at least 15 calendar days before the testimony  of a witness or evidence is to be provided. The Board may, in its  discretion, honor requests for subpoenas not made within this time  limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form; issuance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every subpoena shall be in the form  specified in the appendix to the rules of this chapter and this form  shall not be altered. Unless a party has the approval of a judge to  submit a subpoena in blank (in whole or in part), a party shall submit  to the judge a completed subpoena (save the ``Return on Service''  portion). In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the judge shall  sign the subpoena. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall  complete the subpoena before service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the person subpoenaed is located in a foreign country, a  letter rogatory or a subpoena may be issued and served under the  circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The party requesting a subpoena shall arrange for  service. Service shall be made as soon as practicable after the subpoena  has been issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition  or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a  United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is  not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena  upon a person named therein shall be made by personal delivery of a copy  to that person and tender of the fees for one day's attendance and the  mileage allowed by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law; however,  where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, money payments  need not be tendered in advance of attendance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Proof of service. The person serving the subpoena shall make  proof of service thereof to the Board promptly and in any event before  the date on which the person served must respond to the subpoena. Proof  of service shall be made by completion and execution and submission to  the Board of the ``Return on Service'' portion of a duplicate copy of  the subpoena issued by a judge. If service is made by a person other  than a United States marshal or his deputy, that person shall make an  affidavit as proof by executing the ``Return on Service'' in the  presence of a notary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Motion to quash or to modify. Upon written motion by the person  subpoenaed or by a party, made within 14 calendar days after service,  but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for  compliance, the Board may quash or modify the subpoena if it is  unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown, or require  the party in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the  reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed evidence. Where circumstances  require, the Board may act upon such a motion at any time after a copy  has been served upon opposing parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena. In a case of contumacy  or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or  transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States district  court, the Board shall apply to the court through the Attorney General  of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before  the Board to give testimony, produce evidence, or both.
