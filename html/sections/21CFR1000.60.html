                                Sec. 1000.60  Recommendation on administratively required dental x-ray examinations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Food and Drug Administration recommends that dental x-ray  examinations be performed only after careful consideration of the dental  or other health needs of the patient, that is, when the patient's  dentist or physician judges them to be necessary for diagnosis,  treatment, or prevention of disease. Administratively required dental x- ray examinations are those required by a remote third party for reasons  not related to the patient's immediate dental needs. These x-ray  examinations are usually a source of unnecessary radiation exposure to  the patient. Because any unnecessary radiation exposure should be  avoided, third parties should not require dental x-ray examinations  unless they can demonstrate that such examinations provide a direct  clinical benefit to the patient, and the patient's dentist or physician  agrees with that assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Some examples of administrative x-ray examinations that should  not be required by third parties are those intended solely:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To monitor insurance claims or detect fraud;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To satisfy a prerequisite for reimbursement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To provide training or experience;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To certify qualifications or competence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This recommendation is not intended to preclude dental x-ray  examinations ordered by the attending practitioner, based on the  patient's history or physical examination, or those performed on  selected populations shown to have significant yields of previously  undiagnosed disease. This recommendation is also not intended to  preclude the administrative use by third parties of dental radiographs  that are taken on the order of the patient's dentist or physician as a  necessary part of the patient's clinical care.
