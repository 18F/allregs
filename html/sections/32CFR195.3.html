This directive applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended under any such program after January 7, 1965 pursuant to an application approved prior to such date. This directive does not apply to: (a) Any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended under any such program before January 7, 1965, (c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except as noted in Sec. 195.4(b)(5) of this part. The fact that a program or activity is not listed in appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such program is not covered. Other programs under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the Federal Register.
