                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every establishment shall validate the HACCP plan's adequacy in controlling the food safety hazards identified during the hazard analysis, and shall verify that the plan is being effectively implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial validation. Upon completion of the hazard analysis and development of the HACCP plan, the establishment shall conduct activities designed to determine that the HACCP plan is functioning as intended. During this HACCP plan validation period, the establishment shall repeatedly test the adequacy of the CCP's, critical limits, monitoring and recordkeeping procedures, and corrective actions set forth in the HACCP plan. Validation also encompasses reviews of the records themselves, routinely generated by the HACCP system, in the context of other validation activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ongoing verification activities. Ongoing verification activities include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The calibration of process-monitoring instruments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct observations of monitoring activities and corrective actions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The review of records generated and maintained in accordance with Sec. 417.5(a)(3) of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Reassessment of the HACCP plan. Every establishment shall reassess the adequacy of the HACCP plan at least annually and whenever any changes occur that could affect the hazard analysis or alter the HACCP plan. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes in: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; slaughter or processing methods or systems; production volume; personnel; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or, the intended use or consumers of the finished product. The reassessment shall be performed by an individual trained in accordance with Sec. 417.7 of this part. The HACCP plan shall be modified immediately whenever a reassessment reveals that the plan no longer meets the requirements of Sec. 417.2(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reassessment of the HACCP plan. Every establishment shall reassess the adequacy of the HACCP plan at least annually and whenever any changes occur that could affect the hazard analysis or alter the HACCP plan.

For annual reassessments, if the establishment determines that no changes are needed to its HACCP plan, it is not required to document the basis for this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reassessment of the hazard analysis. Any establishment that does not have a HACCP plan because a hazard analysis has revealed no food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur shall reassess the adequacy of the hazard analysis whenever a change occurs that could reasonably affect whether a food safety hazard exists. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes in: raw materials or source of raw materials; product formulation; slaughter or processing methods or systems; production volume; packaging; finished product distribution systems; or, the intended use or consumers of the finished product.
