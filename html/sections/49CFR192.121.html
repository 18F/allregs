                            <p class="depth0">Subject to the limitations of Sec. 192.123, the design pressure for plastic pipe is determined by either of the following formulas:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30NO09.008

Where:
P = Design pressure, gauge, psig (kPa).S = For thermoplastic pipe, the HDB is determined in accordance with the listed specification at a temperature equal to 73 F (23 C), 100 F (38 C), 120 F (49 C), or 140 F (60 C). In the absence of an HDB established at the specified temperature, the HDB of a higher temperature may be used in determining a design pressure rating at the specified temperature by arithmetic interpolation using the procedure in Part D.2 of PPI TR-3/2008, HDB/PDB/SDB/MRS Policies (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7). For reinforced thermosetting plastic pipe, 11,000 psig (75,842 kPa). [Note: Arithmetic interpolation is not allowed for PA-11 pipe.]
t = Specified wall thickness, inches (mm).D = Specified outside diameter, inches (mm).SDR = Standard dimension ratio, the ratio of the average specified outside diameter to the minimum specified wall thickness, corresponding to a value from a common numbering system that was derived from the American National Standards Institute preferred number series 10.D F = 0.32 or= 0.40 for PA-11 pipe produced after January 23, 2009 with a nominal pipe size (IPS or CTS) 4-inch or less, and a SDR of 11 or greater (i.e. thicker pipe wall).
