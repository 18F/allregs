The term ``property management services'' refers to a program  provided by a private company for a fee, which assists you in managing  your residence at your previous official station as a rental property.  Services provided by the company may include, but are not limited to,  obtaining a tenant, negotiating a lease, inspecting the property  regularly, managing repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms,  collecting rent, paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses from  rental proceeds and/or fund of the employee, and accounting for the  transactions and providing periodic reports to the employee.
