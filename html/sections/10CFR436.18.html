                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with this section, each Federal agency shall  measure cost-effectiveness by combining cost data established under  Sec. Sec. 436.16 and 436.17 in the appropriate mode of analysis as  described in Sec. 436.19 through Sec. 436.22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal agencies performing LCC analysis on computers shall use  either the Federal Buildings Life Cycle Costing (FBLCC) software  provided by DOE or software consistent with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Replacement of a building energy or water system with an energy  or water conservation measure by retrofit to an existing Federal  building or by substitution in the design for a new Federal building  shall be deemed cost-effective if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Life cycle costs, as described by Sec. 436.19, are estimated to  be lower; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Net savings, as described by Sec. 436.20, are estimated to be  positive; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The savings-to-investment ratio, as described by Sec. 436.21,  is estimated to be greater than one; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The adjusted internal rate of return, as described by Sec.  436.22, is estimated to be greater than the discount rate as set by DOE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As a rough measure, each Federal agency may determine estimated  simple payback time under Sec. 436.23, which indicates whether a  retrofit is likely to be cost effective under one of the four  calculation methods referenced in Sec. 436.18(c). An energy or water  conservation measure alternative is likely to be cost-effective if  estimated payback time is significantly less than the useful life of  that system, and of the Federal building in which it is to be installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mutually exclusive alternatives for a given building energy or  water system, considered in determining such matters as the optimal size  of a solar energy system, the optimal thickness of insulation, or the  best choice of double-glazing or triple-glazing for windows, shall be  compared and evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs or net savings  over equivalent study periods. The alternative which is estimated to  result in the lowest life cycle costs or the highest net savings shall  be deemed the most cost-effective because it tends to minimize the life  cycle cost of Federal building.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When available appropriations will not permit all cost-effective  energy or water conservation measures to be undertaken, they shall be  ranked in descending order of their savings-to-investment ratios, or  their adjusted internal rate of return, to establish priority. If  available appropriations cannot be fully exhausted for a fiscal year by  taking all budgeted energy or water conservation measures according to  their rank, the set of energy or water conservation measures that will  maximize net savings for available appropriations should be selected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Alternative building designs for new Federal buildings shall be  evaluated on the basis of life cycle costs. The alternative design which  results in the lowest life cycle costs for a given new building shall be  deemed the most cost-effective.
