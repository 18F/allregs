                                Sec. 779.331  Meaning of sales ``for resale.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except with respect to a specific situation regarding certain  building materials, the word ``resale'' is not defined in the Act. The  common meaning of ``resale'' is the act of ``selling again.'' A sale is  made for resale where the seller knows or has reasonable cause to  believe that the goods or services will be resold, whether in their  original form, or in an altered form, or as a part, component or  ingredient of another article. Where the goods or services are sold for  resale, it does not matter what ultimately happens to such goods or  services. Thus, the fact that the goods are consumed by fire or no  market is found for them, and are, therefore, never resold does not  alter the character of the sale which is made for resale. Similarly, if  at the time the sale is made, the seller has no knowledge or reasonable  cause to believe that the goods are purchased for the purpose of resale,  the fact that the goods later are actually resold is not controlling. In  considering whether there is a sale of goods or services and whether  such goods or services are sold for resale in any specific situation,  the term ``sale'' includes, as defined in section 3(k) of the Act, ``any  sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for  sale, or other disposition.'' Thus, under the definition sales by an  establishment to a competitor are regarded as sales for resale even  though made without profit. (Northwestern-Hanna Fuel Co. v. McComb, 166  F. 2d 932 (CA-8).) Similarly, sales for distribution by the purchaser  for business purposes are sales for resale under the ``other  disposition'' language of the definition of ``sale'' even though  distributed at no cost to the ultimate recipient. (See Mitchell v.  Duplicate Photo Service, 13 WH Cases 71, 31 L.C. Par. 70,287 (S.D. Cal.  1956) accord, Mitchell v. Sherry Corine Corporation, 264 F. 2d 831 (CA- 4) (sale of meals to airlines for distribution to their passengers).) It  should be noted, however, that occasional transfer of goods from the  stock of one retail or service establishment to relieve a shortage in  another such establishment under the same ownership will not be  considered as sales for resale.</p>
