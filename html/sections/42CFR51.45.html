(1)  Issuing a public report of the results of an investigation which  maintains the confidentiality of the individuals listed in paragraph  (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting the results of an investigation which maintains the  confidentiality of individual service recipients to responsible  investigative or enforcement agencies should an investigation reveal  information concerning the facility, its staff, or employees warranting  possible sanctions or corrective action. this information may be  reported to agencies responsible for facility licensing or  accreditation, employee discipline, employee licensing or certification,  or criminal prosecution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of any periodic audit, report, or evaluation of the  performance of the P&A; system, the Secretary shall not require the P&A;  system to disclose the identity, or any other personally identifiable  information, of any individual requesting assistance under a program.

The purpose of obtaining such information is solely to  determine that P&A; systems are spending their grant funds awarded under  the Act on serving individuals with mental illness. Officials that have  access to such information must keep it confidential to the maximum  extent permitted by law and regulations. If photostatic copies of  materials are provided, then the destruction of such evidence is  required once such reviews have been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subject to the restrictions and procedures set out in this  section, implementing section 106 (a) and (b) of the Act (42 U.S.C.  10806 (a) and (b)), this part does not limit access by a legal guardian,  conservator, or other legal representative of an individual with mental  illness, unless prohibited by State or Federal law, court order or the  attorney-client privilege.</p>
