                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As a SAP, for each employee who has committed a DOT drug or alcohol regulation violation, and who seeks to resume the performance of safety-sensitive functions, you must establish a written follow-up testing plan. You do not establish this plan until after you determine that the employee has successfully complied with your recommendations for education and/or treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must present a copy of this plan directly to the DER (see Sec. 40.311(d)(9)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You are the sole determiner of the number and frequency of follow-up tests and whether these tests will be for drugs, alcohol, or both, unless otherwise directed by the appropriate DOT agency regulation. For example, if the employee had a positive drug test, but your evaluation or the treatment program professionals determined that the employee had an alcohol problem as well, you should require that the employee have follow-up tests for both drugs and alcohol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> However, you must, at a minimum, direct that the employee be subject to six unannounced follow-up tests in the first 12 months of safety-sensitive duty following the employee's return to safety-sensitive functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may require a greater number of follow-up tests during the first 12-month period of safety-sensitive duty (e.g., you may require one test a month during the 12-month period; you may require two tests per month during the first 6-month period and one test per month during the final 6-month period).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may also require follow-up tests during the 48 months of safety-sensitive duty following this first 12-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are not to establish the actual dates for the follow-up tests you prescribe. The decision on specific dates to test is the employer's.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As the employer, you must not impose additional testing requirements (e.g., under company authority) on the employee that go beyond the SAP's follow-up testing plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements of the SAP's follow-up testing plan ``follow the employee'' to subsequent employers or through breaks in service.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1 to paragraph (e): The employee returns to duty with Employer A. Two months afterward, after completing the first two of six follow-up tests required by the SAP's plan, the employee quits his job with Employer A and begins to work in a similar position for Employer B. The employee remains obligated to complete the four additional tests during the next 10 months of safety-sensitive duty, and Employer B is responsible for ensuring that the employee does so. Employer B learns of this obligation through the inquiry it makes under Sec. 40.25.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2 to paragraph (e): The employee returns to duty with Employer A. Three months later, after the employee completes the first two of six follow-up tests required by the SAP's plan, Employer A lays the employee off for economic or seasonal employment reasons. Four months later, Employer A recalls the employee. Employer A must ensure that the employee completes the remaining four follow-up tests during the next nine months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As the SAP, you may modify the determinations you have made concerning follow-up tests. For example, even if you recommended follow-up testing beyond the first 12-months, you can terminate the testing requirement at any time after the first year of testing. You must not, however, modify the requirement that the employee take at least six follow-up tests within the first 12 months after returning to the performance of safety-sensitive functions.</p>
