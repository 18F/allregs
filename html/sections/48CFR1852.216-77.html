                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1816.406-70(b), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Award Fee for End Item Contracts (APR 2012)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contractor can earn award fee, or base fee, if any, from a  minimum of zero dollars to the maximum stated in NASA FAR Supplement  clause 1852.216-85, ``Estimated Cost and Award Fee'' in this contract.  All award fee evaluations, with the exception of the last evaluation,  will be interim evaluations. At the last evaluation, which is final, the  Contractor's performance for the entire contract will be evaluated to  determine total earned award fee. No award fee or base fee will be paid  to the Contractor if the final award fee evaluation is ``poor/ unsatisfactory.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beginning 6* months after the effective date of this contract,  the Government will evaluate the Contractor's interim performance every  6* months to monitor Contractor   performance prior to contract completion and to provide feedback to the  Contractor. The evaluation will be performed in accordance with  [identify performance evaluation plan] to this contract. The Contractor  may submit a self-evaluation of performance for each period under  consideration. These self-evaluations will be considered by the  Government in its evaluation. The Government will advise the Contractor  in writing of the evaluation results. The plan may be revised  unilaterally by the Government prior to the beginning of any rating  period to redirect emphasis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Base fee, if applicable, will be paid in [Insert ``monthly'',  or less frequent period] installments based on the percent of completion  of the work as determined by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim award fee payments will be made to the Contractor based  on each interim evaluation. The amount of the interim award fee payment  is limited to the lesser of the interim evaluation score or 80 percent  of the fee allocated to that period less any provisional payments made  during the period. All interim award fee payments will be superseded by  the final award fee determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provisional award fee payments will [insert ``not'' if  applicable] be made under this contract pending each interim evaluation.  If applicable, provisional award fee payments will be made to the  Contractor on a [insert the frequency of provisional payments (not more  often than monthly) basis. The amount of award fee which will be  provisionally paid in each evaluation period is limited to [Insert a  percent not to exceed 80 percent] of the prior interim evaluation score  (see [insert applicable cite]). Provisional award fee payments made each  evaluation period will be superseded by the interim award fee evaluation  for that period. If provisional payments made exceed the interim  evaluation score, the Contractor will either credit the next payment  voucher for the amount of such overpayment or refund the difference to  the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer. If the  Government determines that (i) the total amount of provisional fee  payments will apparently substantially exceed the anticipated final  evaluation score, or (ii) the prior interim evaluation is ``poor/ unsatisfactory,'' the Contracting Officer will direct the suspension or  reduction of the future payments and/or request a prompt refund of  excess payments as appropriate. Written notification of the  determination will be provided to the Contractor with a copy to the  Deputy Chief Financial Officer (Finance).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All interim (and provisional, if applicable) fee payments will  be superseded by the fee determination made in the final award fee  evaluation. The Government will then pay the Contractor, or the  Contractor will refund to the Government the difference between the  final award fee determination and the cumulative interim (and  provisional, if applicable) fee payments. If the final award fee  evaluation is ``poor/unsatisfactory'', any base fee paid will be  refunded to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Payment of base fee, if applicable, will be made based on  submission of an invoice by the Contractor. Payment of award fee will be  made by the [insert payment office] based on [Insert method of making  award fee payment, e.g., issuance of a unilateral modification by the  Contracting Officer].</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contracting Officer may direct the withholding of interim  award fee payments until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the  Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's  interest relative to an orderly and timely closeout of the contract.  This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the contracts total  potential award fee or $100,000, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Award fee determinations are unilateral decisions made solely at  the discretion of the Government.</p><p class="depth2">* [A period of time greater or lesser than 6 months may be  substituted in accordance with 1816.405-272(a).]</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [77 FR 18106, Mar. 27, 2012]</p>
