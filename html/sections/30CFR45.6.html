Service of documents upon independent  contractors may be proved by a Post Office return receipt showing that  the documents were delivered to the address of record or that the  documents could not be delivered to the address of record because the  independent contractor is no longer at that address and has established  no forwarding address; because delivery was not accepted at that  address; or because no such address exists. Independent contractors may  request service by delivery to another appropriate address of record  provided by the independent contractor. The telephone number required  under this part will be used in connection with the proposed penalty  assessment procedures in 30 CFR part 100.</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER H_EDUCATION AND TRAINING</p>
