Pricing aspects of the settlement shall be documented in accordance with 15.406-3. The memorandum shall be distributed in accordance with 15.406-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the settlement was negotiated on the basis of individual items, the TCO shall specify the factors considered for each item.

The memorandum shall include explanations of matters involving differences and doubtful questions settled by agreement, and the factors considered. The TCO should include any other matters that will assist reviewing authorities in understanding the basis for the settlement.
