                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Classes of documents to be published. Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) which exempt specified matters from requirements for release to the public [see subpart B of this part], the classes of Department of the Navy documents required to be published on a current basis in the Federal Register are listed below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Naval organization and points of contact--description of the central and

field organization of the Department of the Navy and the locations at which, the members or employees from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Methods and procedures for business with public--statements of the general course and methods by which Department of the Navy functions affecting members of the public are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedural rules and forms--rules of procedure for functions affecting members of the public, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations required to be submitted under such rules of procedures; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Substantive rules and policies--substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the Department of the Navy. Such rules are commonly contained in directives, manuals, and memorandums.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``General applicability'' defined. The definition prescribed in 1 CFR 1.1 pertains to the classes of documents contemplated in Sec. 701.64(b) (4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Internal personnel rules and internal practices. In addition to other exemptions listed in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and subpart B of this part, particular attention is directed to the exemption pertaining to internal personnel rules and internal practices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Local regulations. It is unnecessary to publish in the Federal Register a regulation which is essentially local in scope or application, such as a directive issued by a base commander in the implementation of his responsibility and authority under subpart G of part 700 of this title for guarding the security of the installation or controlling the access and conduct of visitors or tradesmen. However, such publication may be authorized under extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Chief of Naval Operations or the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as appropriate, with the concurrence of the Judge Advocate General.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Incorporation by reference. With the approval of the Director of the Federal Register given in the limited instances authorized in 1 CFR part 51 and 32 CFR 336.5(c), the requirement for publication in the Federal Register may be satisfied by reference in the Federal Register to other publications containing the information which must otherwise be published in the Federal Register. In general, matters eligible for incorporation by reference are restricted to materials in the nature of published data, criteria, standards, specifications, techniques, illustrations, or other published information which are reasonably available to members of the class affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public inspection. When feasible, Department of the Navy and Department of Defense documents published in the Federal Register should be made available for inspection and copying, along with available indexes of such documents, in the same locations used for copying of the documents contemplated in Sec. 701.65.</p>
