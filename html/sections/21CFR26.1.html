Equivalence does not require that the respective regulatory systems have identical procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's).

For the purpose of this subpart, GMP's include, therefore, the system whereby the manufacturer receives the specifications of the product and/or process from the marketing authorization/product authorization or license holder or applicant and ensures the product is made in compliance with its specifications (qualified person certification in the EC).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inspection means an onsite evaluation of a manufacturing facility to determine whether such manufacturing facility is operating in compliance with GMP's and/or commitments made as part of the approval to market a product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inspection report means the written observations and GMP's compliance assessment completed by an authority listed in appendix B of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Regulatory system means the body of legal requirements for GMP's, inspections, and enforcements that ensure public health protection and legal authority to assure adherence to these requirements.
