                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Each owner or operator of an emission  point located at an affected source that uses a control device to comply  with the requirements of this subpart and has one or more parameter  monitoring level requirement specified under this subpart, shall install  the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (b) of this section in  order to demonstrate continued compliance with the provisions of this  subpart. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated,  maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or  other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the  equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times  when organic HAP emissions that are required to be controlled as part of  complying with the emission limits specified in Sec. Sec.  63.1404,  63.1405, 63.1406, 63.1407, and 63.1408 are vented to the control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For control devices controlling less than 1 ton per year of  uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, monitoring shall consist of a daily  verification that the control device is operating properly. If the  control device is used to control batch process vents alone or in  combination with other emission points, the verification may be on a per  batch cycle basis. This verification shall include, but not be limited  to, a daily or per batch demonstration that the control device is  working as designed. The procedure for this demonstration shall be  submitted for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report,  as required by Sec.  63.1417(d)(10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring  parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable  provisions of subpart A, F, or G of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (8) of this section shall be installed as  specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The parameters to be  monitored are specified in Table 3 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a scrubber is used, the following monitoring equipment is  required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pH monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder to  monitor the pH of the scrubber effluent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A flow measurement device equipped with a continuous recorder  shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas stream  flow shall be determined using one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator may determine gas stream flow using the  design blower capacity with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264  through 266 that required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G)  ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the  owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had  been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was  conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized  to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream  flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will  be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require  determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide  a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow  anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions  other than malfunctions. The plan shall include a description of the  methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected  methodology will reliably determine the gas stream flow, and a  description of the records that will be maintained to document the  determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator shall   maintain the plan as specified in Sec.  63.1416(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature  monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device are required,  each equipped with a continuous recorder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a condenser is used, a condenser exit temperature (product  side) monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a carbon adsorber is used, an integrating regeneration  steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure monitoring device having an  accuracy of \10 percent of the flow rate, level, or pressure, or better,  capable of recording the total regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow,  or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each regeneration cycle; and a  carbon bed temperature monitoring device, capable of recording the  carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of  completing any cooling cycle are required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device  equipped with a continuous recorder is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used,  the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or  in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position  before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring  devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and  after the catalyst bed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where a flare is used, a device (including but not limited to a  thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of  continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts  design heat input capacity is used, a temperature monitoring device in  the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder is required. Any boiler  or process heater in which all vent streams are introduced with the  primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel is exempt from this  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> As an alternate to paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this  section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device  equipped with a continuous recorder. Said organic monitoring device  shall meet the requirements of Performance Specification 8 or 9 of 40  CFR part 60, appendix B, and shall be installed, calibrated, and  maintained according to Sec.  63.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative monitoring parameters. An owner or operator may  request approval to monitor parameters other than those specified in  Table 3 of this subpart. The request shall be submitted according to the  procedures specified in Sec.  63.1417(j). Approval shall be requested if  the owner or operator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uses a control device or control technology other than those  included in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (b) of  this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those  specified in Table 3 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> or  (2) of this section. Equipment such as low leg drains, high point  bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief  valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that  takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be  generated as specified in Sec.  63.1416(d)(3). The flow indicator shall  be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert  emissions away from the control device or control technology and to the  atmosphere; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secure the bypass line damper or valve in the non-diverting  position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual  inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least  once every month to ensure that the damper or valve is maintained in the  non-diverting position and emissions are not diverted through the bypass  line. Records shall be generated as specified in Sec.  63.1416(d)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Monitoring for the alternative standards. For control devices  that are used to comply with the provisions of Sec. Sec.  63.1404(b),  63.1405(b), 63.1406(b), 63.1407(b), or 63.1408(b) the owner or operator  shall conduct continuous monitoring of the outlet organic HAP  concentration whenever emissions are vented to the control device.  Continuous monitoring of outlet organic HAP concentration shall be  accomplished using an FTIR instrument following Method PS-15 of 40 CFR  part 60, appendix B. The owner or operator shall calculate a daily  average outlet organic HAP concentration. [65 FR 3290, Jan. 20, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 60932, Oct. 8, 2014]</p>
