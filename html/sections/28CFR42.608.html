                            <p class="depth0">Upon EEOC's transmittal of a dismissal under Sec.  42.607 of this  regulation, the referring agency shall determine within thirty days,  what, if any, action the agency intends to take with respect to the  complaint and then notify the complainant and the recipient. In reaching  that determination, the referring agency shall give due weight to EEOC's  determination that the title VII allegations of the joint complaint  should be dismissed. If the referring agency decides to take action with  respect to a complaint that EEOC has dismissed for lack of reasonable  cause to believe that title VII has been violated, the agency shall  notify the Assistant Attorney General and the Chairman of the EEOC in  writing of the action it plans to take and the basis of its decision to  take such action.</p>
