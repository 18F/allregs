If  your tank is required by Table 2 of this subpart to use Tank Level 1  controls, then you must meet the requirements in paragraph (c) of this  section. If your tank is required by Table 2 of this subpart to use Tank  Level 2 controls, then you must meet the requirements in paragraph (d)  of this section</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> through (5) of  this section.
