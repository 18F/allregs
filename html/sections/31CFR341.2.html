                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The registration of Retirement Plan Bonds is limited to  the names of natural persons in their own right, whether adults or  minors, in either single ownership or beneficiary form. A bond  registered in beneficiary form will be inscribed substantially as  follows (for example): ``John A. Doe payable on death to (or P.O.D.)  Richard B. Roe,'' No more than one beneficiary may be designated on a  bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inscription. The inscription on the face of each bond will show  the name, address, and date of birth of the registered owner, as well as  information as to whether he is a self-employed individual or an  employee, and the amount he contributed (if any) out of his own funds  toward the purchase price of the bond. In the case of any self-employed  individual (who is treated as an employee for the purpose of sections  405 and 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), this amount would be  that portion of the purchase price he contributed (if any) as an  employee and which he will not take into account in determining the  amount deductible for Federal income tax purposes. The name of the  beneficiary, if one is to be designated, will also be shown in the  inscription.  [28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 71 FR 46857, Aug. 15, 2006]</p>
