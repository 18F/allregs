                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability of provisions of this section. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of  a hospital that has an emergency department, if an individual (whether  or not eligible for Medicare benefits and regardless of ability to pay)  ``comes to the emergency department'', as defined in paragraph (b) of  this section, the hospital must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provide an appropriate medical screening examination within the  capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary  services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine  whether or not an emergency medical condition exists. The examination  must be conducted by an individual(s) who is determined qualified by  hospital bylaws or rules and regulations and who meets the requirements  of Sec. 482.55 of this chapter concerning emergency services personnel  and direction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an emergency medical condition is determined to exist,  provide any necessary stabilizing treatment, as defined in paragraph (d)  of this section,   or an appropriate transfer as defined in paragraph (e) of this section.  If the hospital admits the individual as an inpatient for further  treatment, the hospital's obligation under this section ends, as  specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When a waiver has been issued in accordance with section 1135  of the Act that includes a waiver under section 1135(b)(3) of the Act,  sanctions under this section for an inappropriate transfer or for the  direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical screening at  an alternate location do not apply to a hospital with a dedicated  emergency department if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The transfer is necessitated by the circumstances of the  declared emergency in the emergency area during the emergency period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The direction or relocation of an individual to receive medical  screening at an alternate location is pursuant to an appropriate State  emergency preparedness plan or, in the case of a public health emergency  that involves a pandemic infectious disease, pursuant to a State  pandemic preparedness plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The hospital does not discriminate on the basis of an  individual's source of payment or ability to pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The hospital is located in an emergency area during an emergency  period, as those terms are defined in section 1135(g)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> There has been a determination that a waiver of sanctions is  necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A waiver of these sanctions is limited to a 72-hour period  beginning upon the implementation of a hospital disaster protocol,  except that, if a public health emergency involves a pandemic infectious  disease (such as pandemic influenza), the waiver will continue in effect  until the termination of the applicable declaration of a public health  emergency, as provided under section 1135(e)(1)(B) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this subpart--</p><p class="depth0">Capacity means the ability of the hospital to accommodate the  individual requesting examination or treatment of the transferred  individual. Capacity encompasses such things as numbers and availability  of qualified staff, beds and equipment and the hospital's past practices  of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.</p><p class="depth0">Comes to the emergency department means, with respect to an  individual who is not a patient (as defined in this section), the  individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has presented at a hospital's dedicated emergency department, as  defined in this section, and requests examination or treatment for a  medical condition, or has such a request made on his or her behalf. In  the absence of such a request by or on behalf of the individual, a  request on behalf of the individual will be considered to exist if a  prudent layperson observer would believe, based on the individual's  appearance or behavior, that the individual needs examination or  treatment for a medical condition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has presented on hospital property, as defined in this section,  other than the dedicated emergency department, and requests examination  or treatment for what may be an emergency medical condition, or has such  a request made on his or her behalf. In the absence of such a request by  or on behalf of the individual, a request on behalf of the individual  will be considered to exist if a prudent layperson observer would  believe, based on the individual's appearance or behavior, that the  individual needs emergency examination or treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is in a ground or air ambulance owned and operated by the  hospital for purposes of examination and treatment for a medical  condition at a hospital's dedicated emergency department, even if the  ambulance is not on hospital grounds. However, an individual in an  ambulance owned and operated by the hospital is not considered to have  ``come to the hospital's emergency department'' if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ambulance is operated under communitywide emergency medical  service (EMS) protocols that direct it to transport the individual to a  hospital other than the hospital that owns the ambulance; for example,  to the closest appropriate facility. In this case, the individual is  considered to have come to the emergency department of the hospital to  which the individual is transported, at the time the   individual is brought onto hospital property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ambulance is operated at the direction of a physician who  is not employed or otherwise affiliated with the hospital that owns the  ambulance; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Is in a ground or air nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital  property for presentation for examination and treatment for a medical  condition at a hospital's dedicated emergency department. However, an  individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not  considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department, even if  a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital by telephone or  telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want to  transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment.  The hospital may direct the ambulance to another facility if it is in  ``diversionary status,'' that is, it does not have the staff or  facilities to accept any additional emergency patients. If, however, the  ambulance staff disregards the hospital's diversion instructions and  transports the individual onto hospital property, the individual is  considered to have come to the emergency department.</p><p class="depth0">Dedicated emergency department means any department or facility of  the hospital, regardless of whether it is located on or off the main  hospital campus, that meets at least one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is licensed by the State in which it is located under  applicable State law as an emergency room or emergency department;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is held out to the public (by name, posted signs,  advertising, or other means) as a place that provides care for emergency  medical conditions on an urgent basis without requiring a previously  scheduled appointment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year  in which a determination under this section is being made, based on a  representative sample of patient visits that occurred during that  calendar year, it provides at least one-third of all of its outpatient  visits for the treatment of emergency medical conditions on an urgent  basis without requiring a previously scheduled appointment.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency medical condition means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of  sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances  and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate  medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a  pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious  jeopardy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Serious impairment to bodily functions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to  another hospital before delivery; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the  woman or the unborn child.</p><p class="depth0">Hospital includes a critical access hospital as defined in section  1861(mm)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Hospital property means the entire main hospital campus as defined  in Sec. 413.65(b) of this chapter, including the parking lot, sidewalk,  and driveway, but excluding other areas or structures of the hospital's  main building that are not part of the hospital, such as physician  offices, rural health centers, skilled nursing facilities, or other  entities that participate separately under Medicare, or restaurants,  shops, or other nonmedical facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Hospital with an emergency department means a hospital with a  dedicated emergency department as defined in this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0">Inpatient means an individual who is admitted to a hospital for bed  occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services as  described in Sec. 409.10(a) of this chapter with the expectation that  he or she will remain at least overnight and occupy a bed even though  the situation later develops that the individual can be discharged or  transferred to another hospital and does not actually use a hospital bed  overnight.</p><p class="depth0">Labor means the process of childbirth beginning with the latent or  early phase of labor and continuing through   the delivery of the placenta. A woman experiencing contractions is in  true labor unless a physician, certified nurse-midwife, or other  qualified medical person acting within his or her scope of practice as  defined in hospital medical staff bylaws and State law, certifies that,  after a reasonable time of observation, the woman is in false labor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of the Act that has entered  into a Medicare provider agreement under section 1866 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Patient means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual who has begun to receive outpatient services as  part of an encounter, as defined in Sec. 410.2 of this chapter, other  than an encounter that the hospital is obligated by this section to  provide;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An individual who has been admitted as an inpatient, as defined  in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Stabilized means, with respect to an ``emergency medical condition''  as defined in this section under paragraph (1) of that definition, that  no material deterioration of the condition is likely, within reasonable  medical probability, to result from or occur during the transfer of the  individual from a facility or, with respect to an ``emergency medical  condition'' as defined in this section under paragraph (2) of that  definition, that the woman has delivered the child and the placenta.</p><p class="depth0">To stabilize means, with respect to an ``emergency medical  condition'' as defined in this section under paragraph (1) of that  definition, to provide such medical treatment of the condition necessary  to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material  deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during  the transfer of the individual from a facility or that, with respect to  an ``emergency medical condition'' as defined in this section under  paragraph (2) of that definition, the woman has delivered the child and  the placenta.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer means the movement (including the discharge) of an  individual outside a hospital's facilities at the direction of any  person employed by (or affiliated or associated, directly or indirectly,  with) the hospital, but does not include such a movement of an  individual who (i) has been declared dead, or (ii) leaves the facility  without the permission of any such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use of dedicated emergency department for nonemergency services.  If an individual comes to a hospital's dedicated emergency department  and a request is made on his or her behalf for examination or treatment  for a medical condition, but the nature of the request makes it clear  that the medical condition is not of an emergency nature, the hospital  is required only to perform such screening as would be appropriate for  any individual presenting in that manner, to determine that the  individual does not have an emergency medical condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Necessary stabilizing treatment for emergency medical  conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(2)  of this section, if any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare  benefits) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the  individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide  either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at  the hospital, for further medical examination and treatment as required  to stabilize the medical condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For transfer of the individual to another medical facility in  accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception: Application to inpatients. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a hospital has  screened an individual under paragraph (a) of this section and found the  individual to have an emergency medical condition, and admits that  individual as an inpatient in good faith in order to stabilize the  emergency medical condition, the hospital has satisfied its special  responsibilities under this section with respect to that individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This section is not applicable to an inpatient who was admitted  for elective (nonemergency) diagnosis or treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A hospital is required by the conditions of participation for  hospitals under part 482 of this chapter to provide care to its  inpatients in accordance with those conditions of participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Refusal to consent to treatment. A hospital meets the  requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section with respect to an  individual if the hospital offers the individual the further medical  examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the  individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks  and benefits to the individual of the examination and treatment, but the  individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) does not  consent to the examination or treatment. The medical record must contain  a description of the examination, treatment, or both if applicable, that  was refused by or on behalf of the individual. The hospital must take  all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal  (or that of the person acting on his or her behalf). The written  document should indicate that the person has been informed of the risks  and benefits of the examination or treatment, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Delay in examination or treatment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A participating hospital  may not delay providing an appropriate medical screening examination  required under paragraph (a) of this section or further medical  examination and treatment required under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or  insurance status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A participating hospital may not seek, or direct an individual  to seek, authorization from the individual's insurance company for  screening or stabilization services to be furnished by a hospital,  physician, or nonphysician practitioner to an individual until after the  hospital has provided the appropriate medical screening examination  required under paragraph (a) of this section, and initiated any further  medical examination and treatment that may be required to stabilize the  emergency medical condition under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An emergency physician or nonphysician practitioner is not  precluded from contacting the individual's physician at any time to seek  advice regarding the individual's medical history and needs that may be  relevant to the medical treatment and screening of the patient, as long  as this consultation does not inappropriately delay services required  under paragraph (a) or paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Hospitals may follow reasonable registration processes for  individuals for whom examination or treatment is required by this  section, including asking whether an individual is insured and, if so,  what that insurance is, as long as that inquiry does not delay screening  or treatment. Reasonable registration processes may not unduly  discourage individuals from remaining for further evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Refusal to consent to transfer. A hospital meets the  requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an  individual if the hospital offers to transfer the individual to another  medical facility in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and  informs the individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf) of the  risks and benefits to the individual of the transfer, but the individual  (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) does not consent to the  transfer. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the  individual's written informed refusal (or that of a person acting on his  or her behalf). The written document must indicate the person has been  informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and state the reasons  for the individual's refusal. The medical record must contain a  description of the proposed transfer that was refused by or on behalf of  the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Restricting transfer until the individual is stabilized--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General. If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical  condition that has not been stabilized (as defined in paragraph (b) of  this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the meaning of  paragraph (e)(2) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on  the individual's behalf) requests the transfer, after being informed of  the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of  transfer. The request must be in writing and indicate the reasons for  the request as well as indicate that he or she is aware of the risks and  benefits of the transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A physician (within the meaning of section 1861(r)(1) of the  Act) has signed a certification that, based upon the information  available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably  expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another  medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or, in  the case of a woman in labor, to the woman or the unborn child, from  being transferred. The certification must contain a summary of the risks  and benefits upon which it is based; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If a physician is not physically present in the emergency  department at the time an individual is transferred, a qualified medical  person (as determined by the hospital in its by-laws or rules and  regulations) has signed a certification described in paragraph  (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section after a physician (as defined in section  1861(r)(1) of the Act) in consultation with the qualified medical  person, agrees with the certification and subsequently countersigns the  certification. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and  benefits upon which it is based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A transfer to another medical facility will be appropriate only  in those cases in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferring hospital provides medical treatment within its  capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the  case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The receiving facility--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of  the individual; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has agreed to accept transfer of the individual and to provide  appropriate medical treatment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all  medical records (or copies thereof) related to the emergency condition  which the individual has presented that are available at the time of the  transfer, including available history, records related to the  individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or  symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, results of diagnostic studies or  telephone reports of the studies, treatment provided, results of any  tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy  thereof) required under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, and the  name and address of any on-call physician (described in paragraph (g) of  this section) who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable  time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. Other records (e.g.,  test results not yet available or historical records not readily  available from the hospital's files) must be sent as soon as practicable  after transfer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The transfer is effected through qualified personnel and  transportation equipment, as required, including the use of necessary  and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A participating hospital may not penalize or take adverse action  against a physician or a qualified medical person described in paragraph  (e)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because the physician or qualified medical  person refuses to authorize the transfer of an individual with an  emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, or against any  hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of a  requirement of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Recipient hospital responsibilities. A participating hospital  that has specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not  limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock-trauma units, neonatal  intensive case units, or, with respect to rural areas, regional referral  centers (which, for purposes of this subpart, mean hospitals meeting the  requirements of referral centers found at Sec. 412.96 of this chapter))  may not refuse to accept from a referring hospital within the boundaries  of the United States an appropriate transfer of an individual who  requires such specialized capabilities or facilities if the receiving  hospital has the capacity to treat the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (f) apply to any participating  hospital with specialized capabilities, regardless of whether the  hospital has a dedicated emergency department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Termination of provider agreement. If a hospital fails to meet  the requirements of paragraph (a) through (f) of this section, CMS may  terminate the provider agreement in accordance with Sec. 489.53.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)(3)</em> of this section, in  cases where a medical opinion is necessary to determine a physician's or  hospital's liability under section 1867(d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of the Act, CMS requests  the appropriate QIO (with a contract under Part B of title XI of the  Act) to review the alleged section 1867(d) violation and provide a  report on its findings in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv) and (v)  of this section. CMS provides to the QIO all information relevant to the  case and within its possession or control. CMS, in consultation with the  OIG, also provides to the QIO a list of relevant questions to which the  QIO must respond in its report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of review and opportunity for discussion and additional  information. The QIO shall provide the physician and hospital reasonable  notice of its review, a reasonable opportunity for discussion, and an  opportunity for the physician and hospital to submit additional  information before issuing its report. When a QIO receives a request for  consultation under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the following  provisions apply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The QIO reviews the case before the 15th calendar day and makes  its tentative findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within 15 calendar days of receiving the case, the QIO gives  written notice, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the  physician or the hospital (or both if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The written notice must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name of each individual who may have been the subject of the  alleged violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date on which each alleged violation occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An invitation to meet, either by telephone or in person, to  discuss the case with the QIO, and to submit additional information to  the QIO within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice, and a  statement that these rights will be waived if the invitation is not  accepted. The QIO must receive the information and hold the meeting  within the 30-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A copy of the regulations at 42 CFR 489.24.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the  date of receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the certified mail date  on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The physician or hospital (or both where applicable) may  request a meeting with the QIO. This meeting is not designed to be a  formal adversarial hearing or a mechanism for discovery by the physician  or hospital. The meeting is intended to afford the physician and/or the  hospital a full and fair opportunity to present the views of the  physician and/or hospital regarding the case. The following provisions  apply to that meeting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The physician and/or hospital has the right to have legal  counsel present during that meeting. However, the QIO may control the  scope, extent, and manner of any questioning or any other presentation  by the attorney. The QIO may also have legal counsel present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The QIO makes arrangements so that, if requested by CMS or the  OIG, a verbatim transcript of the meeting may be generated. If CMS or  OIG requests a transcript, the affected physician and/or the affected  hospital may request that CMS provide a copy of the transcript.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The QIO affords the physician and/or the hospital an opportunity  to present, with the assistance of counsel, expert testimony in either  oral or written form on the medical issues presented. However, the QIO  may reasonably limit the number of witnesses and length of such  testimony if such testimony is irrelevant or repetitive. The physician  and/or hospital, directly or through counsel, may disclose patient  records to potential expert witnesses without violating any non- disclosure requirements set forth in part 476 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The QIO is not obligated to consider any additional information  provided by the physician and/or the hospital after the meeting, unless,  before   the end of the meeting, the QIO requests that the physician and/or  hospital submit additional information to support the claims. The QIO  then allows the physician and/or the hospital an additional period of  time, not to exceed 5 calendar days from the meeting, to submit the  relevant information to the QIO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Within 60 calendar days of receiving the case, the QIO must  submit to CMS a report on the QIO's findings. CMS provides copies to the  OIG and to the affected physician and/or the affected hospital. The  report must contain the name of the physician and/or the hospital, the  name of the individual, and the dates and times the individual arrived  at and was transferred (or discharged) from the hospital. The report  provides expert medical opinion regarding whether the individual  involved had an emergency medical condition, whether the individual's  emergency medical condition was stabilized, whether the individual was  transferred appropriately, and whether there were any medical  utilization or quality of care issues involved in the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The report required under paragraph (h)(2)(v) of this section  should not state an opinion or conclusion as to whether section 1867 of  the Act or Sec. 489.24 has been violated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals  or when there was no screening examination, the QIO review described in  this section is not required before the OIG may impose civil monetary  penalties or an exclusion in accordance with section 1867(d)(1) of the  Act and 42 CFR part 1003 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the QIO determines after a preliminary review that there was  an appropriate medical screening examination and the individual did not  have an emergency medical condition, as defined by paragraph (b) of this  section, then the QIO may, at its discretion, return the case to CMS and  not meet the requirements of paragraph (h) except for those in paragraph  (h)(2)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Release of QIO assessments. Upon request, CMS may release a QIO  assessment to the physician and/or hospital, or the affected individual,  or his or her representative. The QIO physician's identity is  confidential unless he or she consents to its release. (See Sec. Sec.  476.132 and 476.133 of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Availability of on-call physicians. In accordance with the on- call list requirements specified in Sec. 489.20(r)(2), a hospital must  have written policies and procedures in place--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To respond to situations in which a particular specialty is not  available or the on-call physician cannot respond because of  circumstances beyond the physician's control; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To provide that emergency services are available to meet the  needs of individuals with emergency medical conditions if a hospital  elects to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permit on-call physicians to schedule elective surgery during  the time that they are on call;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permit on-call physicians to have simultaneous on-call duties;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Participate in a formal community call plan.
