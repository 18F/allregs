                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> By the Secretary. The Secretary may disclose business  proprietary information submitted to the Secretary only to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An authorized applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An employee of the Department of Commerce or the International  Trade Commission directly involved in the proceeding in which the  information is submitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employee of the Customs Service directly involved in  conducting a fraud investigation relating to an antidumping or  countervailing duty proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The U.S. Trade Representative as provided by 19 U.S.C. 3571(i);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any person to whom the submitting person specifically authorizes  disclosure in writing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A charged party or counsel for the charged party under 19 CFR  part 354.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By an authorized applicant. An authorized applicant may retain  business proprietary information for the time authorized by the terms of  the administrative protective order. An authorized applicant may use  business proprietary information for purposes of the segment of a  proceeding in which the information was submitted. If business  proprietary information that was submitted in a segment of the  proceeding   is relevant to an issue in a different segment of the proceeding, an  authorized applicant may place such information on the record of the  subsequent segment as authorized by the APO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identifying parties submitting business proprietary information.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a party submits a document containing business proprietary  information of another person, the submitting party must identify,  contiguously with each item of business proprietary information, the  person that originally submitted the item (e.g., Petitioner, Respondent  A, Respondent B). Business proprietary information not identified will  be treated as information of the person making the submission. If the  submission contains business proprietary information of only one person,  it shall so state on the first page and identify the person that  originally submitted the business proprietary information on the first  page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a party to a proceeding is not represented by an authorized  applicant, a party submitting a document containing the unrepresented  party's business proprietary information must serve the unrepresented  party with a version of the document that contains only the  unrepresented party's business proprietary information. The document  must not contain the business proprietary information of other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure to parties not authorized to receive business  proprietary information. No person, including an authorized applicant,  may disclose the business proprietary information of another person to  any other person except another authorized applicant or a Department  official described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Any person that  is not an authorized applicant and that is served with business  proprietary information must return it to the sender immediately, to the  extent possible without reading it, and must notify the Department. An  allegation of an unauthorized disclosure will subject the person that  made the alleged unauthorized disclosure to an investigation and  possible sanctions under 19 CFR part 354.
