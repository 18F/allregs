                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 4972 imposes a tax of 6 percent on the amount of the excess contributions (as defined in section 4972 (b) and (c) of this section) under certain qualified plans (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, of the employer who maintains such plan. Partnerships and sole proprietors are to report this tax by filing Form 5330 (or other designated form) and the tax is to be paid annually at the time prescribed for filing such return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employers to whom section applies. The tax under section 4972 is imposed on employers who maintain a qualified plan during their taxable year. For this purpose, the term qualified plan means a pension or profit-sharing plan which includes a trust described in section 401(a), an annuity plan described in section 403(a), or a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a). In addition to being a qualified plan, the plan must

provide contributions or benefits for employees some or all of whom are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1). For this purpose, the plan does not have to provide contributions or benefits for employees who are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) during the taxable year; it is sufficient that the plan so provided in a prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excess contributions--(1) In general.

For purposes of section 4972(b) and this section, the amount of any contribution made under the plan which is allocable to the purchase of life, accident, health, or other insurance is not taken into account. The amount of any contribution which is allocable to the cost of insurance protection is determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.404(e)-1A and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-16.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contributions by owner-employees--(1) General rule. In the case of a plan which provides contributions or benefits for employees some or all of whom are owner-employees, within the meaning of section 401(c)(3), the amount determined under section 4972(b)(2) and this paragraph for the employer's taxable year is the amount computed separately with respect to each owner-employee equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A and B are the only owner-employees covered under the X Employees' Trust. The X Partnership, the X Trust, and the X Plan all use the calendar year as their annual accounting period, at all relevant times. The amount determined under section 4972(b)(2) for 1975 is 0 because this section does not apply to contributions made for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976. In calendar year 1976, A contributes $2,500 and B contributes $2,500 to the trust. The amount permitted to be contributed to the trust for 1976 with respect to A as an employee is $1,800 and with respect to B as an employee is $2,200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount determined under this paragraph for 1976 with respect to A is $700, computed as follows: the sum of the excess of the amount contributed by A ($2,500) over the amount permitted to be contributed by A ($1,800), and the amount determined under this paragraph for A in 1975 (0).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount determined under this paragraph for 1976 with respect to B is $300, computed as follows: the sum of the excess of the amount contributed by B ($2,500) over the amount permitted to be contributed by B ($2,200), and the amount determined under this paragraph for B in 1975 (0).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The amount determined under section 4972(b)(2) and this paragraph for 1976 with respect to the employer, X Partnership, is $1,000, the sum of the amounts determined separately under this paragraph with respect

The tax under section 4972 for 1976 on the X Partnership (assuming that no other events affecting the determination of the tax under section 4972 occur) is 6 percent of $1,000 or $60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the facts stated in Example (1).

See section 404 and the regulations thereunder for the determination of the amount deductible by the employer for the taxable year. If the amounts contributed by the employer exceed the amounts which have been deductible, the amount determined under this paragraph shall not exceed the amounts which have not been deductible. For purposes of this paragraph, the determination of both the amounts contributed and the amounts deductible by the employer for any relevant taxable year includes amounts contributed and deductible on behalf of any employee covered under the plan, including common-law employees and other self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees in addition to owner-employees. The determination of whether the full funding limitation is zero shall be made taking into account all the plan assets unreduced by any deduction carryover under section 404(a)(1)(D). The determination of whether the full funding limitation is zero as of the close of the employer's taxable year shall be made with respect to the plan year ending with or within the employer's taxable year. Consequently, if an employer whose taxable year is the calendar year establishes and maintains a defined benefit plan whose plan year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30, the full funding limitation for that plan will be determined with respect to the plan year ending on June 30 within the calendar taxable year including that June 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustration.

If, for any employer taxable year in which a defined contribution plan is maintained, there is a correcting distribution to an employee which could be from amounts described in subparagraph (1)(i) and (iii) of this paragraph for such employee, then such correcting distribution shall be deemed to be made first from amounts described in such subparagraph (1)(i) and then from amounts described in such subparagraph (1)(iii) for purposes of this section and section 72. For the income tax treatment of such distributions to employees, see section 72 and the regulations thereunder. Any such distributions to employees shall not be subject to the tax imposed by section 4975 nor result in the defined contribution plan failing to satisfy the exclusive benefit requirement of section 401(a), solely by reason of being a correcting distribution within the meaning of this paragraph. If, for any employer taxable year in which a defined benefit, or defined contribution plan is maintained, there is a correcting distribution described in subparagraph (1)(ii) or (iii) of this paragraph to the employer maintaining the plan, such distribution shall not be subject to the tax imposed by section 4975 nor result in the plan's failing to satisfy the exclusive benefit or the definitely determinable requirements under section 401(a). If, for any employer taxable year in which a money purchase pension plan is maintained, a correcting distribution described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph is made to an employee who has not yet become eligible to receive retirement benefits under the plan, the qualification of the pension plan (and trust) under section 401(a) may be adversely affected. See Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(i). A correcting distribution described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph to an owner-employee prior to age 59\1/2\ must be precluded under the plan.

The X Partnership (``X'') and Plan Y are on calendar years. In calendar year 1976, A contributes $2,500 and B contributes $2,500 to Plan Y. The amount permitted to be contributed to Plan Y for 1976 with respect to A as an employee is $1,800 and with respect to B as an employee is $2,200. X contributes to Plan Y $5,000 on behalf of A and $5,000 on behalf of B.

The amount determined under section 4972(b)(5) and this paragraph (the correcting distribution for Plan Y) for taxable year 1977 is $4,000, computed and attributed as follows: the sum of (A) $3,000 with respect to A, the amount of the distribution to A applied first to A's $700 amount described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph and next to A's $2,300 amount described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph and (B) $1,000 with respect to B, the amount of the distribution to B applied first to B's $300 amount described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph and next to B's $1,700 amount described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph. For purposes of computing the excess contributions for taxable year 1977, the correcting distribution of $4,000 would not be taken into account because only correcting distributions for prior year are considered.
