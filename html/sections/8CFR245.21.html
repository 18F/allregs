                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. USCIS may adjust the status to that of a lawful  permanent resident, a native or citizen of Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos  who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Was inspected and paroled into the United States before October  1, 1997;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Was paroled into the United States from Vietnam under the  auspices of the Orderly Departure Program (ODP), a refugee camp in East  Asia, or a displaced person camp administered by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Thailand;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Was physically present in the United States prior to and on  October 1, 1997; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is otherwise eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is  otherwise admissible as an immigrant to the United States except as  provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> and in  accordance with the form instructions. Applicants who are 14 through 79  years of age must also submit the biometrics service fee described in 8  CFR 103.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applications from aliens in immigration proceedings. An alien in  pending immigration proceedings who believes he or she is eligible for  adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 must apply  directly to USCIS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. An  immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals may not adjudicate  applications for adjustment of status under this section. An alien who  is currently in immigration proceedings who alleges eligibility for  adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 may contact  USCIS counsel after filing an application to request the consent of  USCIS to the filing of a joint motion for administrative closure. Unless  USCIS consents to such a motion, the immigration judge or the Board may  not defer or dismiss the proceeding in connection with section 586 of  Public Law 106-429.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applications from aliens with final orders of removal,  deportation, or exclusion. An alien with a final order of removal,  deportation, or exclusion who believes he or she is eligible for  adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 must apply  directly to USCIS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application under this section does not automatically stay  the order of removal, deportation, or exclusion. An alien who is  eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law 106- 429 may request a stay of removal during the pendency of the  application. The regulations governing such a request are found at 8 CFR  241.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DHS will exercise its discretion not to grant a stay of removal,  deportation, or exclusion with respect to an alien who is inadmissible  on any of the grounds specified in paragraph (m)(3) of this section,  unless there is substantial reason to believe that USCIS will grant the  necessary waivers of inadmissibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An immigration judge or the Board may not grant a motion to re- open or stay in connection with an application under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If USCIS approves the application, the approval will constitute  the automatic re-opening of the alien's immigration proceedings,  vacating of the final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, and  termination of the reopened proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grounds of inadmissibility that do not apply. In making a  determination of whether an applicant is otherwise eligible for  admission to the United States for lawful permanent residence under the  provisions of section 586 of Public Law 106-429, the grounds of  inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(7)(A), and (a)(9)  of the Act shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver of grounds of inadmissibility. In connection with an  application for adjustment of status under this section, the alien may  apply for a waiver   of the grounds of inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(1), (a)(6)(B),  (a)(6)(C), (a)(6)(F), (a)(8)(A), (a)(10)(B), and (a)(10)(D) of the Act  as provided in section 586(c) of Public Law 106-429, if the alien  demonstrates that a waiver is necessary to prevent extreme hardship to  the alien, or to the alien's spouse, parent, son or daughter who is a  U.S. citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. In  addition, the alien may apply for any other waiver of inadmissibility  under section 212 of the Act, if eligible. In order to obtain a waiver  for any of these grounds, the applicant must submit an application on  the form designated by USCIS with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR  103.7(b)(1) and in accordance with the form instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence. Applicants must submit evidence that demonstrates they  are eligible for adjustment of status under section 586 of Public Law  106-429. Such evidence shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A birth certificate or other record of birth;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation to establish that the applicant was physically  present in the United States on October 1, 1997, under the standards set  forth in Sec. 245.22 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the applicant's Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94)  (see Sec. 1.4) or other evidence that the alien was inspected or  paroled into the United States prior to October 1, 1997, from one of the  three programs listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Subject to  verification, documentation pertaining to paragraph (a)(2) of this  section is already contained in USCIS files and the applicant may submit  an affidavit to that effect in lieu of actual documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Employment authorization. Applicants who want to obtain  employment authorization based on a pending application for adjustment  of status under this section may apply on the form specified by USCIS  with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1) and in accordance with the  form instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Travel while an application to adjust status is pending. An  applicant who wishes to travel outside the United States while the  application is pending must obtain advance permission by filing the  application specified by USCIS with the fee prescribed in 8 CFR  103.7(b)(1) and in accordance with the form instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Approval and date of admission as a lawful permanent resident.  When USCIS approves an application to adjust status to that of lawful  permanent resident based on section 586 of Public Law 106-429, the  applicant will be notified in writing of USCIS's decision. In addition,  the record of the alien's admission as a lawful permanent resident will  be recorded as of the date of the alien's inspection and parole into the  United States, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notice of denial. When USCIS denies an application to adjust  status to that of lawful permanent resident based on section 586 of  Public Law 106-429, the applicant will be notified of the decision in  writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Administrative review. An alien whose application for adjustment  of status under section 586 of Public Law 106-429 is denied by USCIS may  appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Office in accordance  with 8 CFR 103.3(a)(2).
