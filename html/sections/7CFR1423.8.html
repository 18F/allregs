Such approval does not relieve the warehouse operator of any  obligation under any agreement to CCC or any other agency of the United  States, and does not obligate CCC to use the warehouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> CCC will notify the warehouse operator of rejection under this  part in writing. The notification will state the cause(s) for rejection.  CCC will reconsider a warehouse for approval when the warehouse operator  establishes that the reasons for rejection have been remedied or  requests reconsideration of the action and presents to the Director,  KCCO, in writing, information in support of such request. The warehouse  operator may, if dissatisfied with the Director's determination, obtain  a review of the determination and an informal hearing by submitting a  request with the Deputy Administrator. Appeals shall be as prescribed in  part 780 of this title.  [71 FR 35773, June 22, 2006, as amended at 71 FR 42017, July 25, 2006]</p>
