                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State institutions. Regional Counsels are authorized to  cooperate with   State courts, including the production of required records in the  commitment of veterans to State hospitals or in their restoration to  full civil rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Department of Veterans Affairs institutions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assistance to  courts in commitment proceedings. The Regional Counsel will render  assistance to the courts in cases involving the commitment of mentally  ill veterans to the Department of Veterans Affairs. To this end, the  Regional Counsel may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Produce Department of Veterans Affairs records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appear in court and present material facts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When authorized to institute commitment proceedings under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, prepare and present all necessary  legal papers, and arrange and authorize transportation costs of veterans  and attendants at Department of Veterans Affairs expense (Sec. Sec.   14.703 and 14.704).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Commitment proceedings. If a mentally ill veteran will accept  hospitalization voluntarily, no action will be initiated by any  Department of Veterans Affairs employee to commit such veteran. If the  veteran will not accept hospitalization, or after being voluntarily  hospitalized by the Department of Veterans Affairs demands his or her  release, and hospitalization is necessary for the veteran's safety or  the safety of others, the Regional Counsel (if a relative of the veteran  or other interested person has not done so) may institute proceedings to  commit the veteran to the Department of Veterans Affairs subject to the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the written consent of the veteran's nearest relative has  been obtained. If the nearest relative cannot be readily contacted or  refuses to consent, coupled with inability or refusal to offer adequate  alternative care, the Regional Counsel may initiate the action if the  petition is signed by another relative, a civil official or  representative of a cooperating agency or other person authorized by  State law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If timely action cannot be taken under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of  this section, the Hospital or Clinic Director, or designee, may sign the  petition if permissible under State law, and the Regional Counsel will  then take any action necessary to bring the matter before the  appropriate court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Illegal commitment. When a hospitalized veteran, previously  committed to the Department of Veterans Affairs, demands release and  continued hospitalization is necessary for the veteran's safety or the  safety of others, and the Regional Counsel determines the commitment to  be illegal, immediate action will be taken to obtain a legal commitment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Restoration proceedings. When a veteran has been a committed  patient in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital and is subsequently  rated competent by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Regional  Counsel upon request, may institute proceedings necessary to restore the  veteran to full civil rights.</p>
