                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Drugs are being offered in dosage forms that are designed to  release the active ingredients over a prolonged period of time. There is  a possibility of unsafe overdosage or ineffective dosage if such  products are improperly made and the active ingredients are released at  one time, over too short or too long a period of time, or not released  at all. Drugs marketed in this form, which are referred to by such terms  as timed-release, controlled-release, prolonged-release, sustained- release, or delayed-release drugs, are regarded as new animal drugs  within the meaning of section 201(v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timed-release dosage form animal drugs that are introduced into  interstate commerce are deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of  section 501(a)(5) of the act and subject to regulatory action, unless  such animal drug is the subject of an approved new animal drug  application, or listed in the index, as required by paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The fact that the labeling of this kind of drug may claim  delayed, prolonged, controlled, or sustained-release of all or only some  of the active ingredients does not affect the new animal drug status of  such articles. A new animal drug application or index listing is  required in any such case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New animal drug applications for timed-release dosage form  animal drugs must contain, among other things, data to demonstrate  safety and effectiveness by establishing that the article is  manufactured using procedures and controls to ensure release of the  total dosage at a safe and effective rate. Data submitted in the new  animal drug application must demonstrate that the formulation of the  drug and the procedures used in its manufacture will ensure release of  the active ingredient(s) of the drug at a safe and effective rate and  that these release characteristics will be maintained until the  expiration date of the drug. When the drug is intended for use in food- producing animals, data submitted must also demonstrate that, with  respect to possible residues of the drug, food derived from treated  animals is safe for consumption.
