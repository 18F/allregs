                            <p class="depth0">This subpart establishes policies pursuant to the requirements of National and Commercial Space Programs (51 U.S.C. 20132) authorizing the NASA Administrator to establish such security requirements, restrictions and safeguards as he deems necessary in the interest of national security, under 5 U.S.C. 301, ``Housekeeping statute,'' and 18 U.S.C. 799, making it criminal to violate published NASA regulations. The provisions of this subpart apply to all NASA installations, including NASA Headquarters, NASA Centers, and component facilities. NASA installations refers to all NASA-owned, controlled, or leased property, with exclusive or concurrent Federal jurisdiction, including non-contiguous or unfenced areas and including areas otherwise open to the public at large. These provisions are also applicable to all persons who operate or control a motor vehicle, or otherwise use the streets of a NASA installation, over which the United States exercises exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.</p>
