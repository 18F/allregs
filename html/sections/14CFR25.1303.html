If airspeed limitations vary with altitude, the indicator must have a maximum allowable airspeed indicator showing the variation of VMO with altitude.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An altimeter (sensitive).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A rate-of-climb indicator (vertical speed).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator combined with an integral slip-skid indicator (turn-and-bank indicator) except that only a slip-skid indicator is required on large airplanes with a third attitude instrument system useable through flight attitudes of 360[deg] of pitch and roll and installed in accordance with Sec. 121.305(k) of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A bank and pitch indicator (gyroscopically stabilized).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A direction indicator (gyroscopically stabilized, magnetic or nonmagnetic).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following flight and navigation instruments are required as prescribed in this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A speed warning device is required for turbine engine powered airplanes and for airplanes with VMO/MMO greater than 0.8 VDF/MDF or 0.8 V D/MD. The speed warning device must give effective aural warning (differing distinctively from aural warnings used for other purposes) to the pilots, whenever the speed exceeds VMO plus 6 knots or MMO +0.01. The upper limit of the production tolerance for the warning device may not exceed the prescribed warning speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A machmeter is required at each pilot station for airplanes with compressibility limitations not otherwise indicated to the pilot by the airspeed indicating system required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
