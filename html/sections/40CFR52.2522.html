                            <p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> EPA is conditionally approving two West Virginia State  Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted on July 1, 2014 and June  6, 2012 relating to revisions to 45CSR14 (Permits for Construction and  Major Modification of Major Stationary Sources of Air Pollution for the  Prevention of Significant Deterioration) for failure to include a  significant monitoring concentration value (SMC) of zero micrograms per  cubic meter for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The  conditional approval is based upon a commitment from the State to submit  an additional SIP revision with a revised regulation at 45CSR14-16.7.c  which will incorporate a SMC value of zero micrograms per cubic meter  for PM2.5 to address this discrepancy and to be consistent  with federal requirements. If the State fails to meet its commitment by  June 24, 2016, the approval is treated as a disapproval.    Sec. Sec. 52.2523-52.2524  [Reserved]</p>
