                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term ``federal license or permit'' means any authorization  that an applicant is required by law to obtain in order to conduct  activities affecting any land or water use or natural resource of the  coastal zone and that any Federal agency is empowered to issue to an  applicant. The term ``federal license or permit'' does not include OCS  plans, and federal license or permit activities described in detail in  OCS plans, which are subject to subpart E of this part, or leases issued  pursuant to lease sales conducted by a Federal agency (e.g., outer  continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas lease sales conducted by the  Minerals Management Service or oil and gas lease sales conducted by the  Bureau of Land Management). Lease sales conducted by a Federal agency  are Federal agency activities under subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term also includes the following types of renewals and major  amendments which affect any coastal use or resource:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Renewals and major amendments of federal license or permit  activities not previously reviewed by the State agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Renewals and major amendments of federal license or permit  activities previously reviewed by the State agency which are filed after  and are subject to management program changes not in existence at the  time of original State agency review; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Renewals and major amendments of federal license or permit  activities previously reviewed by the State agency which will cause an  effect on any coastal use or resource substantially different than those  originally reviewed by the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term ``major amendment'' of a federal license or permit  activity means any subsequent federal approval that the applicant is  required to obtain for modification to the previously reviewed and  approved activity and where the activity permitted by issuance of the  subsequent approval will affect any coastal use or resource, or, in the  case of a major amendment subject to Sec. 930.51(b)(3), affect any  coastal use or resource in a way that is substantially different than  the description or understanding of effects at the time of the original  activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term ``renewals'' of a federal license or permit activity  means any subsequent re-issuance, re-approval or extension of an  existing license or permit that the applicant is required to obtain for  an activity described under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The determination of substantially different coastal effects  under paragraphs (b)(3), and (c) of this section is made on a case-by- case basis by the Federal agency after consulting with the State agency,  and applicant. The Federal agency shall give considerable weight to the  opinion of the State agency. The terms ``major amendment,'' ``renewals''  and ``substantially   different'' shall be construed broadly to ensure that the State agency  has the opportunity to review activities and coastal effects not  previously reviewed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This subpart applies to active applications. If an applicant  withdraws its application to the Federal agency, then the consistency  process is terminated. If the applicant reapplies to the Federal agency,  then a new consistency review process will start. If a Federal agency  stops or stays the Federal license or permit application process, then  the consistency review period will be stopped or stayed for the same  amount of time as for the Federal application process.
