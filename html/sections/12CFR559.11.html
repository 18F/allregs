                                Sec. 559.11  What notices are required to establish or acquire a new  subsidiary or engage in new activities through an existing subsidiary?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,  a savings association (``you'') must file a notice (``Notice'') under  part 516, subpart A of this chapter at least 30 days before establishing  or acquiring a subsidiary or engaging in new activities in a subsidiary.  The Notice must contain all of the information the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) requires under 12 CFR 362.15. Providing OTS  with a copy of the notice you file with the FDIC will satisfy this  requirement. If OTS notifies you within 30 days that the Notice presents  supervisory concerns, or raises significant issues of law or policy, you  must apply for and receive OTS's prior written approval under the  standard treatment processing procedures at part 516, subpart A and E of  this chapter before establishing or acquiring the subsidiary or engaging  in new activities in the subsidiary.
