The  port of entry shall be Agana or such other port as may be satisfactory  to the inspector. Such importations may be made without the submission  of a notice of arrival inasmuch as there is available to the inspector  the essential information normally supplied by an importer at the time  of importation. The requirements of Sec. Sec. 319.55-6 and 319.55-7  shall not apply. Inspections of such importations may be made under the  general authority of Sec. 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an importation  is found infected, infested, or contaminated by any plant pest and is  not subject to disposal under this part, disposition may be made in  accordance with Sec. 330.106 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2">Rules and Regulations</p>
