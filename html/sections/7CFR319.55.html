Sec.  319.56-4  Approval of certain fruits and vegetables for importation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination by the Administrator. The Administrator has determined that the application of one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section to certain imported fruits and vegetables mitigates the risk posed by those commodities, and that such fruits and vegetables may be imported into the United States subject to one or more of those measures, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The name and origin of all fruits and vegetables authorized importation under this section, as well as the applicable requirements for their importation, may be found on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import--export/plants/manuals/ports/downloads/fv.pdf. Commodities that require phytosanitary measures other than one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section may only be imported in accordance with applicable requirements in Sec.  319.56-3 and commodity-specific requirements contained elsewhere in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Designated phytosanitary measures. (1) Fruits or vegetables are subject to inspection upon arrival in the United States and comply with all applicable provisions of Sec.  319.56-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fruits or vegetables are imported from a pest-free area in the country of origin and are accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate stating that the fruits or vegetables originated in a pest-free area in the country of origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The fruits or vegetables are treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The fruits or vegetables are inspected in the country of origin by an inspector or an official of the national plant protection organization of the exporting country, and have been found free of one or more specific quarantine pests identified by risk analysis as likely to follow the import pathway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The fruits or vegetables are imported as commercial consignments only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fruits and vegetables authorized importation under this section. (1) Previously approved fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables that were authorized importation under this subpart either directly by permit or by specific regulation as of August 17, 2007 and that were subject only to one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section and the general requirements of Sec.  319.56-3, may continue to be imported into the United States under

the same requirements that applied before August 17, 2007, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be authorized importation under this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pest risk analysis. The risk posed by the particular fruit or vegetable from a specified country or other region has been evaluated and publicly communicated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Availability of pest risk analysis. APHIS published in the Federal Register, for 60 days public comment, a notice announcing the availability of a pest risk analysis that evaluated the risks associated with the importation of the particular fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination of risk; factors considered. The Administrator determined, and announced in the notice referred to in the previous paragraph, that, based on the information available, the application of one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures described in paragraph (b) of this section is sufficient to mitigate the risk that plant pests or noxious weeds could be introduced into or disseminated within the United States via the imported fruit or vegetable. In order for the Administrator to make the determination described in this paragraph, he or she must conclude based on the information presented in the risk analysis for the fruit or vegetable that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable in the country or other region of origin is mitigated by one or more of the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with the commodity in the country or region of origin, but the pest can be easily detected via inspection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pest freedom. No quarantine pests are known to be associated with the fruit or vegetable in the country or region of origin, or a quarantine pest is associated with the commodity in the country or region of origin but the commodity originates from an area in the country or region that meets the requirements of Sec.  319.56-5 for freedom from that pest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effectiveness of treatment. A quarantine pest is associated with the fruit or vegetable in the country or region of origin, but the risk posed by the pest can be reduced by applying an approved post-harvest treatment to the fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Pre-export inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with the commodity in the country or region of origin, but the commodity is subject to pre-export inspection, and the commodity is to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate that contains an additional declaration that the commodity has been inspected and found free of such pests in the country or region of origin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commercial consignments. A quarantine pest is associated with the fruit or vegetable in the country or region of origin, but the risk posed by the pest can be reduced by commercial practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Issuance of import permits. The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice.

If, after August 17, 2007, the Administrator determines that one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures is not sufficient to mitigate the risk posed by any of the fruits and vegetables that are authorized importation into the United States under this section, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict importation of the fruit or vegetable. APHIS may also publish a notice in the Federal Register advising the public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended import requirements, provide an effective date for the

change, and will invite public comment on the subject.

Sec.  319.56-5  Pest-free areas.</p><p class="depth0">As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable. In other cases, fruits and vegetables may be imported if the area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the remaining quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application of international standard for pest free areas. APHIS requires that determinations of pest-free areas be made in accordance with the criteria for establishing freedom from pests found in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 4, ``Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas.'' The international standard was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by reference in Sec.  300.5 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of pest freedom. (1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice or rule published in the Federal Register for 60 days public comment, that the area meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS would begin issuing permits for importation of the fruit or vegetable from a pest-free area because:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No comments were received on the notice or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS would publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn, and that imports of host crops for the pest in question are subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, importation of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> General requirements for fruits and vegetables imported from pest-free areas. (1) Labeling. Each box of fruits or vegetables that is imported into the United States from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The name of the municipality and State in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The type and amount of fruit the box contains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Phytosanitary certificate. A phytosanitary certificate must accompany the imported fruits or vegetables, and must contain an additional declaration that the fruits originate from a pest-free area that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If

fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent export to the United States. These safeguards described in this section must be intact upon arrival in the United States.

Sec.  319.56-6  Trust fund agreements.</p><p class="depth0">If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of fruits or vegetables and APHIS services are to be funded by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time the fruits or vegetables are exported. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.

The apples or pears may be imported in any single shipping season only if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Officials of the NPPO must survey each orchard producing apples or pears for shipment to the United States at least twice between spring blossoming and harvest. If the officials find any leaf miners that suggest the presence of Leucoptera malifoliella in an orchard, the officials must reject any fruit harvested from that orchard during that growing season for shipment to the United States. If the officials find evidence in an orchard of any other plant pest referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, they must ensure that the orchard and all other orchards within 1 kilometer of that orchard will be treated for that pest with a pesticide approved by the APHIS, in accordance with label directions and under the direction of the plant protection organization.

In addition, one carton from every pallet in each grower lot must be inspected by officials of the plant protection service. If the inspections reveal any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera malifoliella, the entire grower lot must be rejected for shipment to the United States, and the plant protection service must reject for shipment any additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of that shipping season. If the inspections reveal any other insect pest referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, and a treatment authorized in part 305 of this chapter is available, the fruit will remain eligible for shipment to the United States if the entire grower lot is treated for the pest under the supervision of an inspector.

Preclearance inspection will be conducted in the exporting country by an inspector. Preclearance inspection will be conducted for a minimum of 6,000 cartons of apples or pears, which may represent multiple grower lots from different packing sheds. The cartons examined during any given preclearance inspection will be known as an inspection unit. Apples or pears in any inspection unit may be shipped to the United States only if the inspection unit passes inspection as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inspectors will examine, fruit by fruit, a biometrically designed statistical sample of 300 cartons drawn from each inspection unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If inspectors find any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera malifoliella, they will reject the entire inspection unit for shipment to the United States. The inspectors also will reject for shipment any additional fruit from the producing orchard for the remainder of the shipping season. However, other orchards represented in the rejected inspection unit will not be affected for the remainder of the shipping season because of that rejection. Additionally, if inspectors reject any three inspection units in a single shipping season because of Leucoptera malifoliella on fruit processed by a single packing shed, no additional fruit from that packing shed will be accepted for shipment to the United States for the remainder of that shipping season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the inspectors find evidence of any other plant pest referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, and a treatment authorized in part 305 of this chapter is available, fruit in the inspection unit will remain eligible for shipment to the United States if the entire inspection unit is treated for the pest under the supervision of an inspector. However, if the entire inspection unit is not treated in this manner, or if a plant pest is found for which no treatment authorized in part 305 of this chapter is available, the inspectors will reject the entire inspection unit for shipment to the United States.

If the preclearance program is terminated with any country, precleared fruit in transit to the United States at the time of termination will be spot-checked by inspectors upon arrival in the United States for evidence of plant pests referred to in paragraph (g) of this section. If any live larva or pupa of Leucoptera malifoliella is found in any carton of fruit, inspectors will reject that carton and all other cartons in that consignment that are from the same producing orchard. In addition, the remaining cartons of fruit in that consignment will be reinspected as an inspection unit in accordance with the preclearance procedures prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Termination of preclearance programs.

Initial approval of the production sites will be completed jointly by SAG and APHIS. SAG will visit and inspect the production sites monthly, starting 2 months before harvest and continuing until the end of the shipping season. APHIS may monitor the production sites at any time during this period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tomato production sites must consist of pest-exclusionary greenhouses, which must have double self-closing doors and have all other openings and vents covered with 1.6 mm (or less) screening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The tomatoes must originate from an area that has been determined by APHIS to be free of Medfly in accordance with the procedures described in Sec.  319.56-5 or an area where Medfly trapping occurs. Production sites in areas where Medfly is known to occur must contain traps for both Medfly and Rhagoletis tomatis in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) and (d)(2)(iv) of this section. Production sites in all other areas do not require trapping for Medfly. The trapping protocol for the detection of Medfly in infested areas is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> McPhail traps with an approved protein bait must be used within registered greenhouses. Traps must be placed inside greenhouses at a density of 4 traps/10 ha, with a minimum of at least two traps per greenhouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Medfly traps with trimedlure must be placed inside a buffer area 500 meters wide around the registered production site, at a density of 1 trap/10 ha and a minimum of 10 traps. These traps must be checked at least every 7 days. At least one of these traps must be near a greenhouse. Traps must be set for at least 2 months before export and

trapping and continue to the end of the harvest season.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Medfly prevalence levels in the surrounding areas must be 0.7 Medflies per trap per week or lower. If levels exceed this before harvest, the production site will be prohibited from shipping under the systems approach. If the levels exceed this after the 2 months prior to harvest, the production site would be prohibited from shipping under the systems approach until APHIS and SAG agree that the pest risk has been mitigated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Registered production sites must contain traps for Rhagoletis tomatis in accordance with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> McPhail traps with an approved protein bait must be used within registered greenhouses. Traps must be placed inside greenhouses at a density of 4 traps/10 ha, with a minimum of at least two traps per greenhouse. Traps inside greenhouses will use the same bait for Medfly and Rhagoletis tomatis because the bait used for R. tomatis is sufficient for attracting both types of fruit fly within the confines of a greenhouse; therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat this trapping protocol in production sites in areas where Medfly is known to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> McPhail traps with an approved protein bait must be placed inside a 500 meter buffer zone at a density of 1 trap/10 ha surrounding the production site. At least one of the traps must be near a greenhouse. Traps must be set for at least 2 months before export until the end of the harvest season and must be checked at least every 7 days. In areas where Medfly trapping is required, traps located outside of greenhouses must contain different baits for Medfly and Rhagoletis tomatis. There is only one approved bait for R. tomatis and the bait is not strong enough to lure Medfly when used outside greenhouses; therefore, separate traps must be used for each type of fruit fly present in the area surrounding the greenhouses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If within 30 days of harvest a single Rhagoletis tomatis is captured inside the greenhouse or in a consignment or if two R. tomatis are captured or detected in the buffer zone, shipments from the production site will be suspended until APHIS and SAG determine that risk mitigation is achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Registered production sites must conduct regular inspections for Tuta absoluta throughout the harvest season and find these areas free of T. absoluta evidence (e.g., eggs or larvae). If within 30 days of harvest, two T. absoluta are captured inside the greenhouse or a single T. absoluta is found inside the fruit or in a consignment, shipments from the production site will be suspended until APHIS and SAG determine that risk mitigation is achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> SAG will ensure that populations of Liriomyza huidobrensis inside greenhouses are well managed by doing inspections during the monthly visits specifically for L. huidobrensis mines in the leaves and for visible external pupae or adults. If L. huidobrensis is found to be generally infesting the production site, shipments from the production site will be suspended until APHIS and SAG agree that risk mitigation is achieved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> All traps must be placed at least 2 months prior to harvest and be maintained throughout the harvest season and be monitored and serviced weekly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> SAG must maintain records of trap placement, checking of traps, and of any Rhagoletis tomatis or Tuta absoluta captures for 1 year for APHIS review. SAG must maintain an APHIS approved quality control program to monitor or audit the trapping program. APHIS must be notified when a production site is removed from or added to the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a pest-exclusionary packinghouse. The tomatoes must be safeguarded by a pest-proof screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. Tomatoes must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin for transit to the United States. These safeguards must remain intact until arrival in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting fruit to the United States, the packinghouse may only accept fruit from registered approved production sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> SAG is responsible for export certification inspection and issuance of phytosanitary certificates.
