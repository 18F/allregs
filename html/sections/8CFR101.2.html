or visa, or for the purpose of using the passport or visa of another person or otherwise evading any provision of the immigration laws, and that the name used at the time of entry was one by which he had been known for a sufficient length of time prior to making application for a passport or visa to have permitted the issuing authority or authorities to have made any necessary investigation concerning him or that his true identity was known to such officials.
