                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Department of the Navy Corrections Manual, SECNAVINST 1640.9,  reiterates the requirement of Article 10, UCMJ, that, when a person is  placed in pretrial confinement, immediate steps should be taken to  inform the confinee of the specific wrong of which he is accused and try  him or to dismiss the charges and release him. The Corrections Manual  requires that this information normally will be provided within 48 hours  along with advice as to the confinee's right to consult with lawyer  counsel and his right to prepare for trial. Lawyer counsel may be either  a civilian lawyer provided by the confinee at his own expense or a  military lawyer provided by the Government. If a confinee requests to  confer with a military lawyer, such lawyer should normally be made  available for consultation within 48 hours after the request is made.  [39 FR 18437, May 28, 1974]</p>
