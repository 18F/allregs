                                Sec. 1.66  No-action positions with respect to floor traders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a contract market submits to the National Futures Association by April 26, 1993 a list of floor traders who were granted trading privileges on that contract market on or before April 26, 1993, and whose floor trading privileges remain in effect, which includes the name, date of birth and social security number of such floor traders, as well as facts regarding such floor traders which are set forth as statutory disqualifications in section 8a(2) of the Act if the contract market knows of such facts, and such list is signed by the chief operating officer of the contract market, the Commission will not commence an enforcement proceeding against a floor trader on that list based solely upon the floor trader's failure to register or receive a temporary license under section 4f of the Act and Sec. 3.11 of this chapter, nor will the Commission commence an enforcement proceeding against the contract market under Sec. 1.62 for failing to bar such floor trader from operating as such: Provided, however, That for those floor traders listed as to whom the contract market knows of facts set forth as statutory disqualifications in section 8a(2) of the Act, the no-action position contained in paragraph (a) of this section will only apply if the contract market submits a supplemental statement signed by the chief operating officer of the contract market stating that, in light of the Congressional mandate requiring registration of floor traders under the Act, the contract market acknowledges its responsibility to take affirmative action to conduct appropriate surveillance of

such floor traders. These no-action positions shall expire upon the floor's trader being granted or denied registration under the Act, or on June 11, 1993, whichever comes earliest: Provided, however, That if the floor trader files an application for registration in accordance with Sec. 3.11 of this chapter with the National Futures Association by June 11, 1993, the no-action positions for the floor trader and the contract market as to the registration of such floor trader will be extended until the floor trader is granted or denied registration under the Act, unless an Administrative Law Judge issues an interim order suspending the no-action position as to such floor trader in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or the application for registration is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Suspension of no-action position under paragraph (a) of this section pursuant to section 8a(2) of the Act--(1) Notice. On the basis of information obtained by the Commission, the Commission may at any time serve notice upon a floor trader whose name appears on a list submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Commission alleges and is prepared to prove that such floor trader is subject to one or more of the statutory disqualifications set forth in section 8a(2) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination, based upon written evidence, as to whether the floor trader is subject to such statutory disqualification; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the floor trader is found to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the no-action status of the floor trader under paragraph (a) of this section may be suspended and the floor trader ordered to show cause why registration should not be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Written submission. If the floor trader wishes to challenge the accuracy of the allegations set forth in the notice, the floor trader may submit written evidence limited to the type described in Sec. 3.60(b)(1) of this chapter. Such written submission must be served upon the Division of Enforcement and filed with the Proceedings Clerk within twenty days of the date of service of notice to the floor trader.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reply. Within ten days of receipt of any written submission filed by the floor trader, the Division of Enforcement may serve upon the floor trader and file with the Proceedings Clerk a reply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination by Administrative Law Judge. A determination by the Administrative Law Judge as to whether the floor trader is subject to a statutory disqualification must be based upon the evidence of the statutory disqualification, notice with proof of service, the written submission, if any, filed by the floor trader in response thereto, any written reply submitted by the Division of Enforcement and such other papers as the Administrative Law Judge may require or permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Suspension and order to show cause. (i) If the floor trader is found to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the Administrative Law Judge, within thirty days after receipt of the floor trader's written submission, if any, and any reply thereto, shall issue an interim order suspending the no-action status of the floor trader under paragraph (a) of this section and requiring the floor trader to show cause within twenty days of the date of the order why, notwithstanding the existence of the statutory disqualification, the registration of the floor trader should not be denied. The no-action status of the floor trader shall be suspended, effective five days after the order to show cause is served upon the floor trader in accordance with Sec. 3.50(a) of this chapter, until a final order with respect to the order to show cause has been issued: Provided, That if the sole basis upon which the floor trader is subject to statutory disqualification is the existence of a temporary order, judgment or decree of the type described in section 8a(2)(C) of the Act, the order to show cause shall not be issued and the floor trader shall be suspended until such time as the temporary order, judgment or decree shall have expired: Provided, however, That in no event shall the floor trader's no-action status be suspended for a period to exceed six months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the floor trader is found not to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order to that effect and

the Proceedings Clerk shall promptly serve a copy of such order on the floor trader, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight and the Division of Enforcement. Such order shall be effective as a final order of the Commission fifteen days after the date it is served upon the floor trader in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.50(a) of this chapter unless a timely application for review is filed in accordance with Sec. 10.102 of this chapter. The appellate procedures set forth in Sec. Sec. 10.102, 10.103, 10.104, 10.106, 10.107 and 10.109 of this chapter shall apply to any appeal brought under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Further proceedings. If an order to show cause is issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, further proceedings on such order shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.60(b) through (j) of this chapter.
