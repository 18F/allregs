                            <p class="depth0">The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (NCTTA)  established technology transfer as a mission for Government-owned,  contractor-operated laboratories, including weapons production  facilities, and authorizes those laboratories to negotiate and award  cooperative research and development agreements with public and private  entities for purposes of conducting research and development and  transferring technology to the private sector. In implementing the  NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the  contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology  transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause  required by this subpart. Thus, each management and operating contractor  holds title to subject inventions for the benefit of the laboratory or  facility being managed and operated by that contractor.</p>
