                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Rigid nonmetallic materials (plastic) may be used only in non- vital systems and in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Flexible nonmetallic materials (hose) may be used in vital and  non-vital systems where permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nonmetallic piping must not be used in gasoline or diesel fuel  systems. Flexible nonmetallic materials (hose) may be used where  permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Where rigid nonmetallic material (plastic) is permitted for use  in piping systems by this section, the following restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Penetrations of required watertight decks and bulkheads by any  rigid plastic pipe are prohibited unless the following requirements are  met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each penetration must be accomplished using an acceptable  metallic through deck or through bulkhead fitting that is welded or  otherwise attached to the bulkhead or deck by an accepted method; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One or more metallic shutoff valves must be installed adjacent  to the fitting in one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Only one metallic shutoff valve must be installed if it is  operable from above the bulkhead deck;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If two metallic shutoff valves are installed, one on either side  of the bulkhead, they need not be operable from above the bulkhead deck  provided immediate access to both is possible; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Where both plastic and metallic materials are used in piping  that penetrates a bulkhead, and the two materials exist entirely on  opposite sides of the bulkhead, a metallic shutoff valve must be  installed at the bulkhead in the metallic part of the system, with the  valve being capable of operation from above the bulkhead deck, or  locally if immediate access is possible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Protection from mechanical damage must be specifically  considered and all protective covering or shields must be installed to  the satisfaction of the cognizant OCMI;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Through hull fittings and shutoff valves must be metallic. In  the case of nonmetallic hulls, materials that will afford an equal  degree of safety and heat resistivity as that afforded by the hull may  be approved; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The material specification must show that the rigid nonmetallic  material possesses characteristics adequate for its intended service and  environment and must be approved for use by the cognizant OCMI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Where flexible nonmetallic hose is permitted for use in piping  systems by this section, it must meet SAE J-1942 (incorporated by  reference; see 46 CFR 175.600) or be specifically approved by the  Commandant. The following restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Flexible nonmetallic hose must be complete with factory- assembled end fittings requiring no further adjustment of the fittings  on the hose, or field attachable type fittings may be used. Hose end  fittings must comply with SAE J-1475 (incorporated by reference; see 46  CFR 175.600). Field attachable fittings must be installed following the  manufacturer's recommended practice. If special equipment is required,  such as crimping machines, it must be of the type and design specified  by the manufacturer. If field attachable type fittings are used, each  hose assembly must be individually hydrostatically tested to twice the  maximum operating pressure of the system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flexible nonmetallic hose may be used in non-vital water and  pneumatic systems, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(1)  through (d)(4) of this section. Unreinforced hoses are limited to a  maximum service pressure of 349 kPa (50 psig), reinforced hoses are  limited to a maximum service pressure of 1,034 kPa (150 psig); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flexible nonmetallic hose may be used in lube oil, fuel oil and  fluid power systems, subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Flexible hose may only be used at a pressure not to exceed the  manufacturer's rating and must have a high resistance to saltwater,  petroleum oils, and vibration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Flexible hose runs must be visible, easily accessible,  protected from mechanical damage, and must not penetrate watertight  decks or bulkheads;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Flexible hose must be fabricated with an inner tube and a  cover of synthetic rubber or other suitable material reinforced with  wire braid;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Flexible hose used for alcohol-gasoline blend fuels must meet  the permeability requirements specified in 33 CFR part 183, subpart J;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For the purpose of flexibility only, flexible hose installed in  lengths of not more than 760 millimeters (30 inches) and subject to  pressures of not more than 35 kPa (5 psig), may meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Suitable compression type connection fittings may be accepted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Flexible hose designed for use with hose clamps may be installed  with two clamps, at both ends of the hose, which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Do not rely on the spring tension of the clamp for compressive  force; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Are installed beyond the bead or flare or over the serrations of  the mating spud, pipe, or hose fitting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> USCG Type A1, A2, B1, or B2 flexible hose may be accepted in  accordance with 33 CFR part 183, subpart J.
