Notice of an application for a temporary cease-and-desist order shall be made by serving a notice of hearing and order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b) or, where timely service of a notice of hearing pursuant to Sec. 201.141(b) is not practicable, by any other means reasonably calculated to give actual notice that a hearing will be held, including telephonic notification of the general subject matter, time, and place of the hearing. If an application is made ex parte, pursuant to Sec. 201.513, no notice to a respondent need be given prior to the Commission's consideration of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearing before the Commission.

Alternative means of remote access, including a video link, shall be permitted in the Commission's discretion. Factors the Commission may consider in determining whether to permit alternative means of remote access include, but are not limited to, whether allowing an alternative means of access will delay the hearing, whether the alternative means is reliable, and whether the party proposing its use has made arrangements to pay for its cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After a hearing has begun, the Commission may, on its own motion, or the motion of a party, assign a hearing officer to preside at the taking of oral testimony or other evidence and to certify the record of such testimony or other evidence to the Commission within a fixed period of time. No recommended or initial decision shall be made by such a hearing officer.</p>
