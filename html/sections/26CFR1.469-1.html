In 1993, an individual derives $10,000 of ordinary income from passive activity X, no gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets or assets used in a trade or

business, $12,000 of capital loss from passive activity Y, and no income, gain, deductions, or losses from any other passive activity. The capital loss from activity Y is a passive activity deduction (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-2T(d)). Under section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the taxpayer is allowed $10,000 of the $12,000 passive activity deduction and has a $2,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year. Since the $10,000 passive activity deduction allowed under section 469 is a capital loss, such deduction is allowable for the taxable year only to the extent provided under section 1211. Therefore, the taxpayer is allowed $3,000 of the $10,000 capital loss under section 1211 and has a $7,000 capital loss carryover (within the meaning of section 1212(b)) to the succeeding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)-(e)(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)-(e)(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(2)</em> Trade or business activities.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(4). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns interests in a convenience store and an apartment building. In each taxable year, the taxpayer's interests in the convenience store and the apartment building are treated under Sec. 1.469-4 as interests in two separate passive activities of the taxpayer. A $5,000 loss from the convenience-store activity and a $3,000 loss from the apartment-building activity are disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1993. Under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $5,000 loss from the convenience-store activity is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1993, and the $3,000 loss from the apartment-building activity is treated similarly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1994, the convenience store is continued in a single activity, and the section 469 activities that constituted the apartment building is similarly continued in a separate activity. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the convenience-store activity for 1993 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section to the taxpayer's convenience-store activity in 1994. Similarly, the disallowed deductions from the apartment-building activity for 1993 must be allocated to the taxpayer's apartment-building activity in 1994. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the convenience-store activity in 1994 are treated as deductions from that activity for 1994, and the disallowed deductions allocated to the apartment-building activity for 1994 are treated as deductions from the apartment-building activity for 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1993, the taxpayer acquires a restaurant and a catering business. Assume that in 1993 and 1994 the restaurant and the catering business are treated under Sec. 1.469-4 as an interest in a single passive activity of the taxpayer (the restaurant and catering activity). A $10,000 loss from the activity is disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1994. Assume that in 1995, the taxpayer's interests in the restaurant and the catering business are treated under Sec. 1.469-4 as interests in two separate passive activities of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $10,000 loss from the restaurant and catering activity is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1994. In 1995, the businesses that constituted the restaurant and catering activity are continued, but are treated as two separate activities under Sec. 1.469-4. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the restaurant and catering activity for 1994 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section between the restaurant activity and the catering activity in 1995 in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each of the activities continues the single restaurant and catering activity. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the restaurant activity in 1995 are treated as deductions from the restaurant activity for 1995, and the disallowed deductions allocated to the catering activity in 1995 are treated as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1993, the taxpayer acquires a restaurant and a catering business. Assume that in 1993 and 1994 the restaurant and the catering business are treated underSec. 1.469-4 as an interest in a single passive activity of the taxpayer (the restaurant and catering activity). A $10,000 loss from the activity is

disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1994. Assume that in 1995, the taxpayer's interests in the restaurant and the catering business are treated under Sec. 1.469-4 as interestes in two separate passive activities of the taxpayer. In addition, a $20,000 loss from the activity was disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1993, and the gross income and deductions (including deductions that were disallowed for 1993 under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2)) from the restaurant and catering business for 1993 and 1994 are as follows:

The remainder of this example describes a number of allocation methods that will ordinarily satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. The description of specific allocation methods in this example does not preclude the use of other reasonable allocation methods for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ordinarily, an allocation of disallowed deductions from the restaurant to the restaurant activity and disallowed deductions from the catering business to the catering activity would satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Under Sec. 1.469-1T (f)(2)(ii), a ratable portion of each deduction from the restaurant and catering activity is disallowed for 1994. Thus, $3,000 of the 1994 deductions from the restaurant are disallowed ($10,000x$30,000/$100,000), and $7,000 of the 1994 deductions from the catering business are disallowed ($10,000x$70,000/$100,000). Thus, the taxpayer can ordinarily treat $3,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the restaurant activity for 1995, and $7,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ordinarily, an allocation of disallowed deductions between the restaurant activity and catering activity in proportion to the losses from the restaurant and from the catering business for 1994 would also satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. If the restaurant and the catering business had been treated as separate activities in 1994, the restaurant activity would have had net income of $10,000 and the catering activity would have had a $20,000 loss. Thus, the taxpayer can ordinarily treat all $10,000 of disallowed deductions as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ordinarily, an allocation of disallowed deductions between the restaurant activity and catering activity in proportion to the losses from the restaurant and from the catering business for 1994 (determined as if the restaurant and the catering business had been separate activities for all taxable years) would also satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. If the restaurant and the catering business had been treated as separate activities for all taxable years, the entire $20,000 loss from the restaurant in 1993 would have been allocated to the restaurant activity in 1994, and the gross income and deductions from the separate activities for 1994 would be as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Catering</p><p class="depth0">Restaurant    business------------------------------------------------------------------------Gross income..................................      $40,000      $50,000Deductions....................................       42,000       58,000</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Net income (loss).......................      (2,000)      (8,000)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Thus, the taxpayer can ordinarily treat $2,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the restaurant activity for 1995, and $8,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer is a partner in a law partnership that acquires a building in December 1993 for use in the partnership's law practice. In taxable year 1993, four floors that are not needed in the law practice are leased to tenants; in taxable year 1994, two floors are leased to tenants; in taxable years after 1994, only one floor is leased to tenants and the rental operations are insubstantial. Assume that under Sec. 1.469-4, the law practice and the rental property are treated as a trade or business activity and a separate rental activity for taxable years 1993 and 1994. Assume further that the law practice and the rental operations are a single trade or business activity for taxable years after 1994 under Sec. 1.469-4. The trade or business activity is not a passive activity of the taxpayer. The rental activity, however, is a passive activity. Under Sec. 1.469-T(f)(2), a $12,000 loss from the rental activity is disallowed for 1993 and a $9,000 loss from the rental activity is disallowed for 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $12,000 loss from the rental activity for 1993 is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1993. In 1994, the business of the rental activity is continued in two separate activities. Only two floors of the building remain in the rental activity, and the

other two floors (i.e., the floors that were leased to tenants in 1993, but not in 1994) are used in the taxpayer's law-practice activity. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the rental activity for 1993 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section between the rental activity and the law-practice activity in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each of the activities continues business on the four floors that were leased to tenants in 1993. In these circumstances, the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section would ordinarily be satisfied by any of the allocation methods illustrated in Example 3 or by an allocation of 50 percent of the disallowed deductions to each activity. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the rental activity in 1994 are treated as deductions from the rental activity for 1994, and the disallowed deductions ($6,000) allocated to the law-practice activity in 1994 are treated as deductions from the law-practice activity for 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $9,000 loss from the rental activity for 1994 is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1994. In 1995, the rental activity is continued in the taxpayer's law-practice activity. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the rental activity for 1994 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section to the taxpayer's law-practice activity in 1995. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the law-practice activity are treated as deductions from the law-practice activity for 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rules relating to former passive activities will be contained in paragraph (k) of this section. Under those rules, any disallowed deductions from the rental activity that are treated as deductions from the law-practice activity will be treated as unused deductions that are allocable to a former passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns stock in a corporation that is an S corporation for the taxpayer's 1993 taxable year and a C coporation thereafter. The only activity of the corporation is a rental activity. For 1993, the taxpayer's pro rata share of the corporation's loss from the rental activity is $5,000, and the entire loss is disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2), the taxpayer's $5,000 loss from the rental activity is allocated among the taxpayer's deductions from that activity for 1993. In 1994, the rental activity is continued through a C corporation, and the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section as a passive activity that continues the rental activity (the C corporation activity) for purposes of allocating the previously disallowed loss. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the rental activity for 1993 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section to the taxpayer's C corporation activity in 1994, and are treated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section as deductions from the C corporation activity for 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treating the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation as an interest in a passive activity that continues the business of the rental activity does not change the character of the taxpayer's dividend income from the C corporation. Thus, the taxpayer's dividend income is portfolio income (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)) and is not included in passive activity gross income. Accordingly, the taxpayer's loss from the C corporation activity for 1994 is $5,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns stock in a corporation that is an S corporation for the taxpayer's 1993 taxable year and a C corporation thereafter. The only activity of the corporation is a rental activity. For 1993, the taxpayer's pro rata share of the corporation's loss from the rental activity is $5,000, and the entire loss is disallowed under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2). The taxpayer has $2,000 in income from other passive activities for 1994, and as a result, only 60% of the taxpayer's loss from the C corporation activity ($3,000) is disallowed for 1994 under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $3,000 disallowed loss from the C corporation activity is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1994.

For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, extraordinary personal services are provided in connection with making property available for use by customers only if the services provided in connection with the use of the property are performed by individuals,

and the use by customers of the property is incidental to their receipt of such services. For example, the use by patients of a hospital's boarding facilities generally is incidental to their receipt of the personal services provided by the hospital's medical and nursing staff.

If the taxpayer owns an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture conducting an activity other than a rental activity, and the taxpayer provides property for use in the activity in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in such partnership, S corporation, or joint venture, the provision of such property is not a rental activity. Thus, if a partner contributes the use of property to a partnership, none of the partner's distributive share of partnership income is income from a rental activity unless the partnership is engaged in a rental activity. In addition, a partner's gross income attributable to a payment described in section 707(c) is not income from a rental activity under any circumstances (see Sec. 1.469-2T (e)(2)). The determination of whether property used in an activity is provided by the taxpayer in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture shall be made on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples.

The average period of customer use for the equipment exceeds 30 days. Pursuant to the lease agreements, skilled technicians employed by the taxpayer maintain the equipment and service malfunctioning equipment for no additional charge. Service calls occur frequently (three times per week on average) and require substantial labor. The value of the maintenance and repair services (measured by the cost to the taxpayer of employees performing these services) exceeds 50 percent of the amount charged for the use of the

equipment. Under these facts, services performed by individuals are provided in connection with the use of the photocopying equipment, but the customers' use of the photocopying equipment is not incidental to their receipt of the services. Therefore, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) are not provided in connection with making the photocopying equipment available for use by customers, and the activity is a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the average period of customer use for the photocopying equipment exceeds seven days but does not exceed 30 days. Under these facts, significant personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section) are provided in connection with making the photocopying equipment available for use by customers and, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the activity is not a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The taxpayer is engaged in an activity of transporting goods for customers. In conducting the activity, the taxpayer provides tractor-trailers to transport goods for customers pursuant to arrangements under which the tractor-trailers are selected by the taxpayer, may be replaced at the sole option of the taxpayer, and are operated and maintained by drivers and mechanics employed by the taxpayer. The average period of customer use for the tractor-trailers exceeds 30 days. Under these facts, the use of tractor-trailers by the taxpayer's customers is incidental to their receipt of personal services provided by the taxpayer. Accordingly, the services performed in the activity are extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) and, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the activity is not a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The taxpayer is engaged in an activity of owning and operating a residential apartment hotel. For the taxable year, the average period of customer use for apartments exceeds seven days but does not exceed 30 days. In addition to cleaning public entrances, exists, stairways, and lobbies, and collecting and removing trash, the taxpayer provides a daily maid and linen service at no additional charge. All of the services other than maid and linen service are excluded services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section), because such services are similar to those commonly provided in connection with long-term rentals of high-grade residential real property. The value of the maid and linen services (measured by the cost to the taxpayer of employees performing such services) is less than 10 percent of the amount charged to tenants for occupancy of apartments. Under these facts, neither significant personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section) nor extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) are provided in connection with making apartments available for use by customers. Accordingly, the activity is a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The taxpayer owns 1,000 acres of unimproved land with a fair market value of $350,000 and an unadjusted basis of $210,000. The taxpayer holds the land for the principal purpose of realizing gain from appreciation. In order to defray the cost of carrying the land, the taxpayer leases the land to a rancher, who uses the land to graze cattle and pays rent of $4,000 per year. Thus, the gross rental income from the land is less than two percent of the lesser of the fair market value and the unadjusted basis of the land (.02 x $210,000 = $4,200). Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, the rental of the land is not a rental activity because the rental is treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(B) of this section as incidental to an activity of holding the property for investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A calendar year taxpayer owns an interest in a farming activity which is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) and owns farmland which was used in the farming activity in 1985 and 1986. The fair market value of the farmland is $350,000 and its unadjusted basis is $210,000. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, the taxpayer continues to own an interest in the farming activity but does not use the land in the activity. In 1987, the taxpayer leases the land for $4,000 to a rancher, who uses the land to graze cattle. In 1988, the taxpayer leases the land for $10,000 to a film production company, which uses the land to film scenes for a movie. In 1989, the taxpayer again leases the land for $4,000 to the rancher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For 1987 and 1989, the taxpayer owns an interest in a trade or business activity, and the farmland which the taxpayer leases to the rancher was used in such activity for two out of the five immediately preceding taxable years. In addition, the gross rental income from the land ($4,000) is less than two percent of the lesser of the fair market value and the unadjusted basis of the land (.02 x $210,000 = $4,200). Accordingly, the taxpayer's rental of the land is treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(C) of this section as incidental to the taxpayer's farming activity, and is not a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the taxpayer's gross rental income from the land for 1988 ($10,000) is not less than two percent of the lesser of the fair market value and the unadjusted basis of the land, the requirement of paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(C)(3) of this section is not met. Therefore, the taxpayer's rental of the land in 1988 is not treated as incidental to the taxpayer's farming activity and is a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1988, the taxpayer acquires vacant land for the purpose of constructing a shopping mall. Before commencing construction, the taxpayer leases the land under a one-year lease to an automobile dealer, who uses the land to park cars held in its inventory. The taxpayer commences construction of the shopping mall in 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer acquired the land for the principal purpose of constructing the shopping mall, not for the principal purpose of realizing gain from the appreciation of the property. Therefore, the rental of the property in 1988 is not treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(B) of this section as incidental to an activity of holding the property for investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The land has not been used in any taxable year in any trade or business of the taxpayer. Therefore, the rental of the property in 1988 is not treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(C) of this section as incidental to a trade or business activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Since the rental of the land in 1988 is not treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section as incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer, the rental of the land in 1988 is a rental activity. See Sec. 1.469-2T(f)(3) for a special rule relating to the treatment of gross income from the rental of nondepreciable property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The taxpayer makes farmland available to a tenant farmer pursuant to an arrangement designated a ``crop-share lease.'' Under the arrangement, the tenant is required to use the tenant's best efforts to farm the land and produce marketable crops. The taxpayer is obligated to pay 50 percent of the costs incurred in the activity (without regard to whether any crops are successfully produced or marketed), and is entitled to 50 percent of the crops produced (or 50 percent of the proceeds from marketing the crops). For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section, the taxpayer is treated as providing the farmland for use in a farming activity conducted by a joint venture in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in the joint venture. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, the taxpayer is not engaged in a rental activity, without regard to whether the taxpayer performs any services in the farming activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The taxpayer owns a taxicab which the taxpayer operates during the day and leases to another driver for use at night under a one-year lease. Under the terms of the lease, the other driver is charged a fixed rental for use of the taxicab. Assume that, under the rules to be contained in Sec. 1.469-4T, the taxpayer is engaged in two separate activities, an activity of operating the taxicab and an activity of making the taxicab available for use by the other driver. Under these facts, the period for which the other driver uses the taxicab exceeds 30 days, and the taxpayer does not provide extraordinary personal services in connection with making the taxicab available to the other driver. Accordingly, the lease of the taxicab is a rental activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The taxpayer operates a golf course. Some customers of the golf course pay green fees upon each use of the golf course, while other customers purchase weekly, monthly, or annual passes. The golf course is open to all customers from sunrise to sunset every day of the year except certain holidays and days on which the taxpayer determines that the course is too wet for play. The taxpayer thus makes the golf course available during prescribed hours for nonexclusive use by various customers. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, the taxpayer is not engaged in a rental activity, without regard to the average period of customer use for the golf course.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule for oil and gas working interests--(i) In general.

If gross income and deductions from an activity for a taxable year are treated as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, such activity shall be treated as a passive activity for such year for purposes of applying paragraph (f) (2) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Meaning of certain terms. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Allocable deductions. The deductions allocable to a taxable year are any deductions that arise in such year (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-2T (d)(8)) and any deductions that are treated as deductions for such year under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disqualified deductions.

The ``net loss'' of a taxpayer from an oil or gas well for a taxable year equals the amount by which the taxpayer's deductions that are attributable to such oil or gas well and allocable to such year exceeds the gross income of the taxpayer from such well for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Ratable portion. The ``ratable portion'' of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil or gas well for a taxable year equals the total amount of such gross income multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The disqualified deductions from such oil or gas well for the taxable year; by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total amount of the deductions that are attributable to such oil or gas well and allocable to the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a calendar year individual, acquires on January 1, 1987, a general partnership interest in P, a calendar year partnership that holds a working interest in an oil or gas property. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, A is entitled to convert the general partnership interest into a limited partnership interest at any time. On December 1, 1987, pursuant to a contract with D, an independent drilling contractor, P commences drilling a single well pursuant to the working interest. Under the drilling contract, P pays D for the drilling only as the work is performed. All drilling costs are deducted by P in the year in which they are paid. At the end of 1987, A converts the general partnership interest into a limited partnership interest, effective immediately. The drilling of the well is completed on February 28, 1988. A's interest in the well would but for this paragraph (e)(4) be an interest in a passive activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Throughout 1987, A holds the working interest through an entity that does not limit A's liability with respect to the drilling of the well pursuant to the working interest. In 1988, however, A holds the working interest through an entity that limits A's liability with respect to the drilling and operation of the well throughout such year. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, A's interest in P's well is not an interest in a passive activity for 1987 but is an interest in a passive activity for 1988. Moreover, since economic performance occurs in 1987 with respect to all items of deduction for drilling costs that are allocable to 1987, A has no disqualified deductions for 1987.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that all costs of drilling under the contract with D (including costs of drilling performed after 1987) are paid before the end of 1987 and A has a net loss for 1987. In addition, A has $15,000 of total deductions that are attributable to the well and allocable to 1987, but economic performance (as that term is used in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(2)(ii) of this section) does not occur with respect to $5,000 of those deductions until 1988. Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, the $5,000 of deductions with respect to which economic performance occurs in 1988 are disqualified deductions and are treated as passive activity deductions for 1987. In addition, one-third ($5,000/$15,000) of

A's gross income from the well for 1987 is treated as passive activity gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Definition of ``working interest.'' [Reserved]. See Sec. 1.469-1(e)(4)(iv) for rules relating to this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Entities that limit liability--(A) General rule. For purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, an entity limits the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the drilling or operation of a well pursuant to a working interest held through such entity if the taxpayer's interest in the entity is in the form of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A limited partnership interest in a partnership in which the taxpayer is not a general partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock in a corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An interest in any entity (other than a limited partnership or corporation) that, under applicable State law, limits the potential liability of a holder of such an interest for all obligations of the entity to a determinable fixed amount (for example, the sum of the taxpayer's capital contributions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other limitations disregarded.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(4)(v):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A owns a 20 percent interest as a general partner in the capital and profits of P, a partnership which owns oil or gas working interests. The other partners of P agree to indemnify A against liability in excess of A's capital contribution for any of P's costs and expenses with respect to P's working interests. As a general partner, however, A is jointly and severally liable for all of P's liabilities and, under paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B)(1) of this section, the indemnification agreement is not taken into account in determining whether A holds the working interests through an entity that limits A's liability. Accordingly, the partnership does not limit A's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of wells pursuant to the working interests.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B owns a 10 percent interest in X, an entity (other than a limited partnership or corporation) created under applicable State law to hold working interests in oil or gas properties. Under applicable State law, B is liable without limitation for 10 percent of X's costs and expenses with respect to X's working interests but is not liable for the remaining 90 percent of such costs and expenses. Since B's liability for the obligations of X is not limited to a determinable fixed amount (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(v)(A)(3) of this section), the entity does not limit B's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of wells pursuant to the working interests.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C is both a general partner and a limited partner in a partnership that owns a working interest in oil or gas property. Because C owns an interest as a general partner in each well drilled pursuant to the working interest, C's entire interest in each well drilled pursuant to the working interest is treated under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section as an interest in an activity that is not a passive activity (without regard to whether C materially participates in such activity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Cross reference to special rule for income from certain oil or gas properties.

A partnership is a trader of stocks, bonds, and other securities (within the meaning of section 1236(c)). The capital employed by the partnership in the trading activity consists of amounts contributed by the partners in exchange for their partnership interests, and funds borrowed by the partnership. The partnership derives gross income from the activity in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains. Under

The gross income from these activities for the taxable year ($20,000) exceeds the passive activity deductions from those activities for the taxable year ($15,000) by $5,000 and, under Sec. 1.469-2T(f)(2), $5,000 of gross income from those activities is treated as not from a passive activity. Therefore, solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f)(2)(i) for the taxable year, activities A and B are treated as a single activity that does not have a loss for the taxable year. Under Sec. 1.469-2T(b), the taxpayer's passive activity loss for the taxable year is $8,000 ($43,000 of passive activity deductions minus $35,000 of passive activity gross income). The results of treating activities A and B as a single activity that does not have a loss for the taxable year is that none of the $8,000 passive activity loss is allocated under this paragraph (f)(2)(i) to activity B for the taxable year, even though the taxpayer incurred a loss in that activity for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation within loss activities--(A) In general.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a passive activity deduction of a taxpayer is the amount of the disallowed portion of the taxpayer's loss from the activity (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section) for the taxable year multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of such deduction; by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sum of all passive activity deductions (other than excluded deductions (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section)) of the taxpayer from such activity from the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Excluded deductions.
