                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opt-out election for self-funded non-Federal governmental  plans--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements subject to exemption. The PHS Act requirements  described in this paragraph are the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods in  accordance with section 2701 of the PHS Act as codified before enactment  of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special enrollment periods for individuals and dependents  described under section 2704(f) of the PHS Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Prohibitions against discriminating against individual  participants and beneficiaries based on health status under section 2705  of the PHS Act, except that the sponsor of a self-funded non-Federal  governmental plan cannot elect to exempt its plan from requirements  under section 2705(a)(6) and 2705(c) through (f) that prohibit  discrimination with respect to genetic information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns under  section 2725 of the PHS Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits  under section 2726 of the PHS Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Required coverage for reconstructive surgery following  mastectomies under section 2727 of the PHS Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Coverage of dependent students on a medically necessary leave  of absence under section 2728 of the PHS Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General rule. For plan years beginning on or after September 23,  2010, a sponsor of a non-Federal governmental plan may elect to exempt  its plan, to the extent the plan is not provided through health  insurance coverage (that is, it is self-funded), from one or more of the  requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) through (vii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for certain collectively bargained plans. In the  case of a plan that is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining  agreement that was ratified before March 23, 2010, and whose sponsor  made an election to exempt its plan from any of the requirements  described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the  provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply for plan years  beginning after the expiration of the term of the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Example 1. A non-Federal governmental employer has  elected to exempt its self-funded group health plan from all of the  requirements described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The plan  year commences September 1 of each year. The plan is not subject to the  provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section until the plan year that  commences on September 1, 2011. Accordingly, for that plan year and any  subsequent plan years, the plan sponsor may elect to exempt its plan  only from the requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) through  (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example 2. A non-Federal governmental employer has elected to  exempt its collectively bargained self-funded plan from all of the  requirements described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The  collective bargaining agreement applies to five plan years, October 1,  2009 through September 30, 2014. For the plan year that begins on  October 1, 2014, the plan sponsor is no longer permitted to elect to  exempt its plan from the requirements described in paragraph (a)(1) of  this section. Accordingly, for that plan year and any subsequent plan  years, the plan sponsor may elect to exempt its plan only from the  requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) through (vii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Limitations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An election under this section cannot  circumvent a requirement of the PHS Act to the extent the requirement  applied to the plan before the effective date of the election.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Example 1. A plan is subject to requirements of section 2727 of  the PHS Act, under which a plan that covers medical and surgical  benefits with respect to a mastectomy must cover reconstructive surgery  and certain other services following a mastectomy. An enrollee who has  had a mastectomy receives reconstructive surgery on August 24. Claims  with respect to the surgery are submitted to and processed by the plan  in September. The group health plan commences a new plan year each  September 1. Effective September 1, the plan sponsor elects to exempt  its plan from section 2727 of the PHS Act. The plan cannot, on the basis  of its exemption election, decline to pay for the claims incurred on  August 24.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a group health plan is co-sponsored by two or more  employers, then only plan enrollees of the non-Federal governmental  employer(s) with a valid election under this section are affected by the  election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Stop-loss or excess risk coverage. For purposes of this  section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Subject to paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, the purchase of  stop-loss or excess risk coverage by a self-funded non-Federal  governmental plan does not prevent an election under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regardless of whether coverage offered by an issuer is  designated as ``stop-loss'' coverage or ``excess risk'' coverage, if it  is regulated as group health insurance under an applicable State law,  then for purposes of this section, a non-Federal governmental plan that  purchases the coverage is considered to be fully insured. In that event,  a plan may not be exempted under this section from the requirements  described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Construction. Nothing in this part should be construed as  imposing collective bargaining obligations on any party to the  collective bargaining process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form and manner of election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election requirements. The  election must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be made in an electronic format in a form and manner as  described by the Secretary in guidance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be made in conformance with all of the plan sponsor's rules,  including any public hearing requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Specify the beginning and ending dates of the period to which  the election is to apply. This period can be either of the following  periods:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A single specified plan year, as defined in Sec. 144.103 of  this subchapter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The ``term of the agreement,'' as specified in paragraph (b)(2)  of this section, in the case of a plan governed by collective  bargaining.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the name of the plan and the name and address of the  plan administrator, and include the name and telephone number of a  person CMS may contact regarding the election.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> State that the plan does not include health insurance coverage,  or identify which portion of the plan is not funded through health  insurance coverage.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Specify each requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section from which the plan sponsor elects to exempt the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Certify that the person signing the election document,  including (if applicable) a third party plan administrator, is legally  authorized to do so by the plan sponsor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Include, as an attachment, a copy of the notice described in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> In the case of a plan sponsor submitting one opt-out election  for all group health plans subject to the same collective bargaining  agreement, include a list of plans subject to the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> In the case of a plan sponsor submitting opt-out elections for  more than one group health plan that is not subject to a collective  bargaining agreement, submit a separate election document for each such  plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section, for purposes of this  section ``term of the agreement'' means all group health plan years  governed by a single collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a group health plan for which the last plan year  governed by a prior collective bargaining agreement expires during the  bargaining process for a new agreement, the term of the prior agreement  includes all plan years governed by the agreement plus the period of  time that precedes the latest of the following dates, as applicable,  with respect to the new agreement:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date of an agreement between the governmental employer and  union officials.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date of ratification of an agreement between the  governmental employer and the union.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The date impasse resolution, arbitration or other closure of the  collective bargaining process is finalized when agreement is not  reached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a group health plan governed by a collective  bargaining agreement for which closure is not reached before the last  plan year under the immediately preceding agreement expires, the term of  the new agreement includes all plan years governed by the agreement  excluding the period that precedes the latest applicable date specified  in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Dispute resolution. Nothing in paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section should be construed to mean that CMS  arbitrates disputes between plan sponsors, participants, beneficiaries,  or their representatives regarding whether an election complies with all  of a plan sponsor's rules.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Future elections not preempted. If a plan must comply with one  or more requirements described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for a  given plan year or period of plan coverage, nothing in this section  should be construed as preventing a plan sponsor from submitting an  election in accordance with this section for a subsequent plan year or  period of plan coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing a timely election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plan not governed by collective  bargaining. Subject to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if a plan is  not governed by a collective bargaining agreement, a plan sponsor or  entity acting on behalf of a plan   sponsor must file an election with CMS before the first day of the plan  year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this section,  if the 45th day falls on or after the first day of the plan year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for timely filing. If the latest filing date  specified under paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section falls on a  Saturday, Sunday, or a State or Federal holiday, CMS accepts filings  submitted on the next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Filing extension based on good cause. CMS may extend the  deadlines specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for  good cause if the plan substantially complies with the requirements of  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Failure to file a timely election. Absent an extension under  paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a plan sponsor's failure to file a  timely election under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section makes the  plan subject to all requirements of this part for the entire plan year  to which the election would have applied, or, in the case of a plan  governed by a collective bargaining agreement, for any plan years under  the agreement for which the election is not timely filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional information required--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written notification. If an  election is timely filed, but CMS determines that the election document  (or the notice to plan enrollees) does not meet all of the requirements  of this section, CMS may notify the plan sponsor, or other entity that  filed the election, that it must submit any additional information that  CMS has determined is necessary to meet those requirements. The  additional information must be filed with CMS by the later of the  following dates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The last day of the plan year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The 45th day after the date of CMS's written notification  requesting additional information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timely response. For submissions via hard copy via U.S. Mail,  CMS uses the postmark on the envelope in which the additional  information is submitted to determine that the information is timely  filed as specified under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the latest  filing date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a State or Federal holiday,  CMS accepts a postmark on the next business day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to respond timely. CMS may invalidate an election if the  plan sponsor, or other entity that filed the election, fails to timely  submit the additional information as specified under paragraph (d)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice to enrollees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory notification. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A plan that  makes the election described in this section must notify each affected  enrollee of the election, and explain the consequences of the election.  For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, if the dependent(s) of a  participant reside(s) with the participant, a plan need only provide  notice to the participant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice must be in writing and, except as provided in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section with regard to initial notices, must be  provided to each enrollee at the time of enrollment under the plan, and  on an annual basis no later than the last day of each plan year (as  defined in Sec. 144.103 of this subchapter) for which there is an  election.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A plan may meet the notification requirements of paragraph (e)  of this section by prominently printing the notice in a summary plan  description, or equivalent description, that it provides to each  enrollee at the time of enrollment, and annually. Also, when a plan  provides a notice to an enrollee at the time of enrollment, that notice  may serve as the initial annual notice for that enrollee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial notices. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a plan is not governed by a collective  bargaining agreement, with regard to the initial plan year to which an  election under this section applies, the plan must provide the initial  annual notice of the election to all enrollees before the first day of  that plan year, and notice at the   time of enrollment to all individuals who enroll during that plan year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a collectively bargained plan, with regard to  the initial plan year to which an election under this section applies,  the plan must provide the initial annual notice of the election to all  enrollees before the first day of the plan year, or within 30 days after  the latest applicable date specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this  section if the 30th day falls on or after the first day of the plan  year. Also, the plan must provide a notice at the time of enrollment to  individuals who--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Enroll on or after the first day of the plan year, when closure  of the collective bargaining process is reached before the plan year  begins; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Enroll on or after the latest applicable date specified in  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section if that date falls on or after the  first day of the plan year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice content. The notice must include at least the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific requirements described in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section from which the plan sponsor is electing to exempt the plan, and  a statement that, in general, Federal law imposes these requirements  upon group health plans.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that Federal law gives the plan sponsor of a self- funded non-Federal governmental plan the right to exempt the plan in  whole, or in part, from the listed requirements, and that the plan  sponsor has elected to do so.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement identifying which parts of the plan are subject to  the election.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement identifying which of the listed requirements, if  any, apply under the terms of the plan, or as required by State law,  without regard to an exemption under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subsequent elections--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Election renewal. A plan sponsor may  renew an election under this section through subsequent elections. The  timeliness standards described in paragraph (c) of this section apply to  election renewals under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Form and manner of renewal. Except for the requirement to  forward to CMS a copy of the notice to enrollees under paragraph  (b)(1)(viii) of this section, the plan sponsor must comply with the  election requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In lieu of  providing a copy of the notice under paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this  section, the plan sponsor may include a statement that the notice has  been, or will be, provided to enrollees as specified under paragraph (e)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Election renewal includes provisions from which plan not  previously exempted. If an election renewal includes a requirement  described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section from which the plan  sponsor did not elect to exempt the plan for the preceding plan year,  the advance notification requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this  section apply with respect to the additional requirement(s) of paragraph  (a) of this section from which the plan sponsor is electing to exempt  the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special rules regarding renewal of an election under a  collective bargaining agreement--(i) If protracted negotiations with  respect to a new agreement result in an extension of the term of the  prior agreement (as provided under paragraph (b)(2)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section)  under which an election under this section was in effect, the plan must  comply with the enrollee notification requirements of paragraph (e)(1)  of this section, and, following closure of the collective bargaining  process, must file an election renewal with CMS as provided under  paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a single plan applies to more than one bargaining unit, and  the plan is governed by collective bargaining agreements of varying  lengths, paragraph (c)(2) of this section, with respect to an election  renewal, applies to the plan as governed by the agreement that results  in the earliest filing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Requirements not subject to exemption--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Genetic information.  Without regard to an election under this section that exempts a non- Federal governmental plan from any or all of the provisions of  Sec. Sec. 146.111 and 146.121, the exemption election must not be  construed to exempt the plan from any provisions of this part that  pertain to genetic information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enforcement. CMS enforces these requirements as provided under  paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effect of failure to comply with certification and notification  requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substantial failure--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as  provided in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, a substantial failure  to comply with paragraph (e) or (g)(1) of this section results in the  invalidation of an election under this section with respect to all plan  enrollees for the entire plan year. That is, the plan is subject to all  requirements of this part for the entire plan year to which the election  otherwise would have applied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of substantial failure. CMS determines whether a  plan has substantially failed to comply with a requirement of paragraph  (e) or (g)(1) of this section based on all relevant facts and  circumstances, including previous record of compliance, gravity of the  violation and whether a plan corrects the failure, as warranted, within  30 days of learning of the violation. However, in general, a plan's  failure to provide a notice of the fact and consequences of an election  under this section to an individual at the time of enrollment, or on an  annual basis before a given plan year expires, constitutes a substantial  failure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Multiple employers. If the plan is sponsored  by multiple employers, and only certain employers substantially fail to  comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) or (g)(1) of this section,  then the election is invalidated with respect to those employers only,  and not with respect to other employers that complied with those  requirements, unless the plan chooses to cancel its election entirely.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Limited failure to provide notice. If a substantial failure to  notify enrollees of the fact and consequences of an election is limited  to certain individuals, the election under this section is valid only  if, for the plan year with respect to which the failure has occurred,  the plan agrees not to apply the election with respect to the  individuals who were not notified and so informs those individuals in  writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Example 1. A self-funded, non-Federal group health  plan is co-sponsored by 10 school districts. Nine of the school  districts have fully complied with the requirements of paragraph (e) of  this section, including providing notice to new employees at the time of  their enrollment in the plan, regarding the group health plan's  exemption under this section from requirements of this part. One school  district, which hired 10 new teachers during the summer for the upcoming  school year, neglected to notify three of the new hires about the group  health plan's exemption election at the time they enrolled in the plan.  The school district has substantially failed to comply with a  requirement of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to these  individuals. The school district learned of the oversight six weeks into  the school year, and promptly (within 30 days of learning of the  oversight) provided notice to the three teachers regarding the plan's  exemption under this section and that the exemption does not apply to  them, or their dependents, during the plan year of their enrollment  because of the plan's failure to timely notify them of its exemption.  The plan complies with the requirements of this part for these  individuals for the plan year of their enrollment. CMS would not require  the plan to come into compliance with the requirements of this part for  other enrollees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example 2. Two non-Federal governmental employers cosponsor a  self-funded group health plan. One employer substantially fails to  comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. While the  plan may limit the invalidation of the election to enrollees of the plan  sponsor that is responsible for the substantial failure, the plan  sponsors determine that administering the plan in that manner would be  too burdensome. Accordingly, in this example, the plan sponsors choose  to cancel the election entirely. Both plan sponsors come into compliance  with the requirements of this part with respect to all enrollees for the  plan year for which the substantial failure has occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Election invalidated. If CMS finds cause to invalidate an  election under this section, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS notifies the plan sponsor (and the plan administrator if  other   than the plan sponsor and the administrator's address is known to CMS)  in writing that CMS has made a preliminary determination that an  election is invalid, and States the basis for that determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS's notice informs the plan sponsor that it has 45 days after  the date of CMS's notice to explain in writing why it believes its  election is valid. The plan sponsor should provide applicable statutory  and regulatory citations to support its position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section. CMS will not consider a  response that is not timely filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If CMS's preliminary determination that an election is invalid  remains unchanged after CMS considers the plan sponsor's timely response  (or in the event that the plan sponsor fails to respond timely), CMS  provides written notice to the plan sponsor (and the plan administrator  if other than the plan sponsor and the administrator's address is known  to CMS) of CMS's final determination that the election is invalid. Also,  CMS informs the plan sponsor that, within 45 days of the date of the  notice of final determination, the plan, subject to paragraph  (i)(1)(iii) of this section, must comply with all requirements of this  part for the specified period for which CMS has determined the election  to be invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Enforcement. To the extent that an election under this section  has not been filed or a non-Federal governmental plan otherwise is  subject to one or more requirements of this part, CMS enforces those  requirements under part 150 of this subchapter. This may include  imposing a civil money penalty against the plan or plan sponsor, as  determined under subpart C of part 150.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Construction. Nothing in this section should be construed to  prevent a State from taking the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>, including requirements  that parallel provisions of title XXVII of the PHS Act, that apply to  non-Federal governmental plans or sponsors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prohibiting a sponsor of a non-Federal governmental plan within  the State from making an election under this section.
