                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When conducting the activities identified in Sec.  217.60(a), the mitigation measures contained in the Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. Sec.  216.106 and 217.66 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation measures include (but are not limited to):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All aircraft and helicopter flight paths must maintain a minimum distance of 1,000 ft (305 m) from recognized seal haul-outs and rookeries (e.g., Point Sal, Purisima Point, Rocky Point), except in emergencies or for real-time security incidents (e.g., search-and-rescue, fire-fighting), which may require approaching pinniped haul-outs and rookeries closer than 1,000 ft (305 m).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For missile and rocket launches, holders of Letters of Authorization must avoid, whenever possible, launches during the harbor seal pupping season of March through June, unless constrained by factors including, but not limited to, human safety, national security, or for space vehicle launch trajectory necessary to meet mission objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vandenberg Air Force Base must avoid, whenever possible, launches which are predicted to produce a sonic boom on the Northern Channel Islands during harbor seal, elephant seal, California sea lion, and northern fur seal pupping seasons of March through June.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If post-launch surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the launch procedure and the monitoring methods must be reviewed, in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and appropriate changes must be made through modification to a Letter of Authorization, prior to conducting the next launch under that Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Delta Mariner (or a similar vessel) operations, cargo unloading, and harbor maintenance dredging measures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If activities occur during nighttime hours, turn on lighting equipment before dusk. Lights must remain on for the entire night to avoid startling pinnipeds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initiate operations before dusk.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Keep construction noises at a constant level (i.e., not interrupted by

periods of quiet in excess of 30 minutes) while pinnipeds are present.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Initiate a gradual start-up of activities to ensure a gradual increase in noise levels if activities cease for longer than 30 minutes and pinnipeds are in the area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conduct visual monitor, by a qualified observer, of the harbor seals on the beach adjacent to the harbor and on rocks for any flushing or other behaviors as a result of activities described in Sec.  217.60(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Delta Mariner and accompanying vessels must enter the harbor only when the tide is too high for harbor seals to haul-out on the rocks; reducing speed to 1.5 to 2 knots (1.5-2 nm/hr; 2.8-3.7 km/hr) once the vessel is within 3 mi (4.83 km) of the harbor. The vessel must enter the harbor stern first, approaching the wharf and moorings at less than 0.75 knot (1.4 km/hr).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Explore alternate dredge methods and introduce quieter techniques and equipment as they become available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Additional mitigation measures as contained in a Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
