                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section provides rules that apply when an  election under section 338 is made for a target that is an insurance  company. The rules in this section apply in addition to those generally  applicable upon the making of an election under section 338. In the case  of a conflict between the provisions of this section and other  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations, the rules set  forth in this section determine the Federal income tax treatment of the  parties and the transaction when a section 338 election is made for an  insurance company target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of ADSP and AGUB--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reserves taken into account as  a liability. Old target's tax reserves are the   reserves for Federal income tax purposes for any insurance, annuity, and  reinsurance contracts deemed sold by old target to new target in the  deemed asset sale. The amount of old target's tax reserves is the amount  that is properly taken into account by old target for the contracts at  the close of the taxable year that includes the deemed sale tax  consequences (before giving effect to the deemed asset sale and  assumption reinsurance transaction). Old target's tax reserves are a  liability of old target taken into account in determining ADSP under  Sec. 1.338-4 and a liability of new target taken into account in  determining AGUB under Sec. 1.338-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of ADSP and AGUB to specific insurance contracts. For  purposes of allocating AGUB and ADSP under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338- 7, the fair market value of a specific insurance, reinsurance or annuity  contract or group of insurance, reinsurance or annuity contracts  (insurance contracts) is the amount of the ceding commission a willing  reinsurer would pay a willing ceding company in an arm's length  transaction for the reinsurance of the contracts if the gross  reinsurance premium for the contracts were equal to old target's tax  reserves for the contracts. See Sec. 1.197-2(g)(5) for rules concerning  the treatment of the amount allocable to insurance contracts acquired in  the deemed asset sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of assumption reinsurance principles--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. If a target is an insurance company, the deemed sale of  insurance contracts is treated for Federal income tax purposes as an  assumption reinsurance transaction between old target, as the reinsured  or ceding company, and new target, as the reinsurer or acquiring  company, at the close of the acquisition date. The Federal income tax  treatment of the assumption reinsurance transaction is determined under  the applicable provisions of subchapter L, chapter 1, subtitle A of the  Internal Revenue Code, as modified by the rules set forth in this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> for old target's and new target's  treatment of the premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ceding commission. Old target is deemed to receive a ceding  commission in an amount equal to the amount of ADSP allocated to the  acquired contracts, as determined under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7  and paragraph (b) of this section. New target is deemed to pay a ceding  commission in an amount equal to the amount of AGUB allocated to the  acquired contracts, as determined under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7  and paragraph (b) of this section. See Sec. 1.817-4(d)(2) for old  target's and new target's treatment of the ceding commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1, 2003, T, an insurance company,  has the following assets with the following fair market values: $10  cash, $30 of securities, $10 of equipment, a life insurance contract  having a value, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, of $17, and  goodwill and going concern value. T has tax reserves of $50 and no other  liabilities. On January 1, 2003, P purchases all of the stock of T for  $16 and makes a section 338 election for T. For purposes of the  capitalization requirements of section 848, assume new T has $20 of  general deductions in its first taxable year ending on December 31,  2003, and earns no other premiums during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For Federal income tax purposes, the section 338  election results in a deemed sale of the assets of old T to new T. Old  T's ADSP is $66 ($16 amount realized for the T stock plus $50  liabilities). New T's AGUB also is $66 ($16 basis for the T stock plus  $50 liabilities). See paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Each of the AGUB  and ADSP is allocated under the residual method of Sec. 1.338-6 to  determine the purchase or sale price of each asset transferred. Each of  the AGUB and ADSP is allocated as follows: $10 to cash (Class I), $30 to  the securities (Class II), $10 to equipment (Class V), $16 to the life  insurance contract (Class VI), and $0 to goodwill and going concern  value (Class VII).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under section 1001, old T's amount realized for the securities  is $30 and for the equipment is $10. As a result of the deemed   asset sale, there is an assumption reinsurance transaction between old T  (as ceding company) and new T (as reinsurer) at the close of the  acquisition date for the life insurance contract issued by old T. See  paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Although the assumption reinsurance  transaction results in a $50 decrease in old T's reserves, which is  taxable income to old T, the reinsurance premium paid by old T is  deductible by old T. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, old T is  deemed to pay a reinsurance premium equal to the reserve for the life  insurance contract immediately before the deemed asset sale ($50) and is  deemed to receive a ceding commission from new T. Under paragraph (c)(3)  of this section, the portion of the ADSP allocated to the life insurance  contract is $16; thus, the ceding commission is $16. Old T, therefore,  is deemed to pay new T a reinsurance premium of $34 ($50 - $16 = $34).  Old T also has $34 of net negative consideration for purposes of section  848. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules relating to the effect  of a section 338 election on the capitalization of amounts under section  848.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> New T obtains an initial basis of $30 in the securities and $10  in the equipment. New T is deemed to receive a reinsurance premium from  old T in an amount equal to the $50 of reserves for the life insurance  contract and to pay old T a $16 ceding commission for the contract. See  paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section. Accordingly, new T includes  $50 of premium in income and deducts $50 for its increase in reserves.  For purposes of section 848, new T has $34 of net positive consideration  for the deemed assumption reinsurance transaction. Because the only  contract involved in the deemed assumption reinsurance transaction is a  life insurance contract, new T must capitalize $2.62 ($34 x 7.7% =  $2.62) under section 848. New T will amortize the $2.62 as provided  under section 848. New T's adjusted basis in the life insurance  contract, which is an amortizable section 197 intangible, is $13.38, the  excess of the $16 ceding commission over the $2.62 capitalized under  section 848. See section 197 and Sec. 1.197-2(g)(5). New T deducts the  $2.62 of the ceding commission that is not amortizable under section 197  because it is reflected in the amount capitalized under section 848 and  also deducts the remaining $17.38 of its general deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except  the life insurance contract has a value of $0 and the fair market value  of T's securities are $60. Thus, to reinsure the contract in an arm's  length transaction, T would have to pay the reinsurer a reinsurance  premium in excess of T's $50 of tax reserves for the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For Federal income tax purposes, the section 338  election results in a deemed sale of the assets of old T to new T. Old  T's ADSP is $66 ($16 amount realized for the T stock plus $50  liabilities). New T's AGUB also is $66 ($16 basis for the T stock plus  $50 liabilities). See paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Each of the AGUB  and ADSP is allocated under the residual method of Sec. 1.338-6 to  determine the purchase or sale price of each asset transferred. Each of  the AGUB and ADSP is allocated as follows: $10 to cash (Class I), $56 to  the securities (Class II), $0 to the equipment (Class V), $0 to the life  insurance contract (Class VI), and $0 to goodwill and going concern  value (Class VII).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Under section 1001, old T's amount realized for the securities  is $56 and for the equipment is $0. As a result of the deemed asset  sale, there is an assumption reinsurance transaction between old T (as  ceding company) and new T (as reinsurer) at the close of the acquisition  date for the life insurance contract issued by old T. See paragraph  (c)(1) of this section. Although the assumption reinsurance transaction  results in a $50 decrease in old T's reserves, which is taxable income  to old T, the reinsurance premium deemed paid by old T to new T is  deductible by old T. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, old T is  deemed to pay a reinsurance premium equal to the reserve for the life  insurance contract immediately before the deemed asset sale ($50), and  is deemed to receive from new T a ceding commission equal to the amount  of AGUB allocated to the life insurance contract ($0), as provided in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Old T also has $50 of net negative  consideration for purposes of section 848. See paragraph (f) of this  section for rules relating to the effect of a section 338 election on  capitalization amounts under section 848.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> New T obtains an initial basis of $56 in the securities (with a  fair market value of $60) and $0 in the equipment (with a fair market  value of $10). New T is deemed to receive a reinsurance premium from old  T in an amount equal to the $50 of reserves for the life insurance  contract. Accordingly, new T includes $50 of premium in income and  deducts $50 for its increase in reserves. For purposes of section 848,  new T has $50 of net positive consideration for the deemed assumption  reinsurance transaction. Because the only contract involved in the  assumption reinsurance transaction is a life insurance contract, new T  must capitalize $3.85 ($50 x 7.7%) under section 848 from the  transaction and deducts the remaining $16.15 of its general deductions.  Because new T allocates $0 of the AGUB to the insurance contract, no  amount is amortizable under section 197 with respect to the insurance  contract. See Sec. 1.338-11T(d) for rules on adjustments required if  new T increases its reserves for, or reinsures at a loss, the acquired  life insurance contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)</em> of this section, in the assumption reinsurance  transaction described in paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. New target  includes the additional premium in gross income for the taxable year in  which new target increases its reserves for acquired contracts. New  target's increase in reserves for the insurance contracts acquired in  the deemed asset sale is a liability of new target not originally taken  into account in determining AGUB that is subsequently taken into  account. Thus, AGUB is increased by the amount of the additional premium  included in new target's gross income. See Sec. Sec. 1.338-5(b)(2)(ii)  and 1.338-7. Old target has no deduction under this paragraph (d) and  makes no adjustments under Sec. Sec. 1.338-4(b)(2)(ii) and 1.338-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. New target is not treated as receiving additional  premium under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It is under state receivership as of the close of the taxable  year for which the increase in reserves occurs; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is required by section 807(f) to spread the reserve increase  over the 10 succeeding taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount of additional premium--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The additional  premium taken into account under this paragraph (d) is an amount equal  to the sum of the positive amounts described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)  and (d)(3)(iii) of this section. However, the additional premium cannot  exceed the limitation described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Increases in unpaid loss reserves. The positive amount with  respect to unpaid loss reserves is computed using the formula A/B x (C- [D + E]) where--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A equals old target's discounted unpaid losses (determined under  section 846) included in AGUB under paragraph 11(b)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> B equals old target's undiscounted unpaid losses (determined  under section 846(b)(1)) as of the close of the acquisition date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> C equals new target's undiscounted unpaid losses (determined  under section 846(b)(1)) at the end of the taxable year that are  attributable to losses incurred by old target on or before the  acquisition date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> D (which may be a negative number) equals old target's  undiscounted unpaid losses as of the close of the acquisition date,  reduced by the cumulative amount of losses, loss adjustment expenses,  and reinsurance premiums paid by new target through the end of the  taxable year for losses incurred by old target on or before the  acquisition date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> E equals the amount obtained by dividing the cumulative amount  of reserve increases taken into account under this paragraph (d) in  prior taxable years by A/B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increases in other reserves. The positive amount with respect  to reserves other than discounted unpaid loss reserves is the net  increase of those reserves due to changes in estimate, methodology, or  other assumptions used to compute the reserves (including the adoption  by new target of a methodology or assumptions different from those used  by old target).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation on additional premium. The additional premium taken  into account by new target under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is  limited to the excess, if any, of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The fair market value of old target's assets acquired by new  target in the deemed asset sale (other than Class VI and Class VII  assets); over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The AGUB allocated to those assets (including increases in AGUB  allocated to those assets as the result of reserve increases by new  target in prior taxable years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of additional premium under section 848. If a portion  of the positive amounts described in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (iii) of  this section are attributable to an increase in reserves for specified  insurance contracts (as defined in section 848(e)), new target takes an  allocable portion of the additional premium in determining its specified  policy acquisition expenses under section 848(c) for the taxable year of  the reserve increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1, 2006, P purchases all of the  stock of T, a non-life insurance company, for $120 and makes a section  338 election for T. On the acquisition date, old T has total reserve  liabilities under state law of $725, consisting of undiscounted unpaid  losses of $625 and unearned premiums of $100. Old T's tax reserves on  the acquisition date are $580, which consist of discounted unpaid losses  (as defined in section 846) of $500 and unearned premiums (as computed  under section 832(b)(4)(B)) of $80. Old T has Class I through Class V  assets with a fair market value of $800. Old T also has a Class VI asset  with a fair market value of $75, consisting of the future profit stream  of certain insurance contracts. During 2006, new T makes loss and loss  adjustment expense payments of $200 with respect to the unpaid losses  incurred by old T before the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2006,  new T reports undiscounted unpaid losses of $475 attributable to losses  incurred before the acquisition date. The related amount of discounted  unpaid losses (as defined in section 846) for those losses is $390.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation and allocation of AGUB. Under Sec. 1.338-5 and  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as of the acquisition date, AGUB is  $700, reflecting the sum of the amount paid for old T's stock ($120) and  the tax reserves assumed by new T in the transaction ($580). The fair  market value of old T's Class I through V assets is $800, whereas the  AGUB available for such assets under Sec. 1.338-6 is $700. There is no  AGUB available for old T's Class VI assets, even though such assets have  a fair market value of $75 on the acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjustments for increases in reserves for unpaid losses. Under  paragraph (d) of this section, new T must determine whether there are  any amounts by which it increased its unpaid loss reserves that will be  treated as an additional premium and an increase in AGUB. New T applies  the formula of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, where A equals $500, B  equals $625, C equals $475, D equals $425 ($625 - $200), and E equals  $0. Under this formula, new T is treated as having increased its  reserves for discounted unpaid losses attributable to losses incurred by  old T by $40 ($500/$625 x ($475 - [$425 + 0]). The limitation under  paragraph (d)(5) of this section based on the difference between the  fair market value of old T's Class I through Class V assets and the AGUB  allocated to such assets is $100. Accordingly, new T includes an  additional premium of $40 in gross income for 2006, and increases the  AGUB allocated to old T's Class I through Class V assets to reflect this  additional premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Further  assume that during 2007 new T deducts total loss and loss expense  payments of $375 with respect to losses incurred by old T before the  acquisition date. On December 31, 2007, new T reports undiscounted  unpaid losses of $150 with respect to losses incurred before the  acquisition date. The related amount of discounted unpaid losses (as  defined in section 846) for those unpaid losses is $125.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. New T must determine whether any amounts by which it  increased its unpaid losses during 2007 will be treated as an additional  premium in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. New T applies the formula  under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, where A equals $500, B equals  $625, C equals $150, D equals $50 ($625 - $575), and E equals $50 ($40  divided by .8). In paragraph (d)(3) of this section, new T is treated as  increasing its reserves for discounted unpaid losses by $40 during 2007  with respect to losses incurred by old T ($500/$625 x ($150-[$50 +  $50]). New T determines the limitation of paragraph (d)(5) of this  section by comparing the $800 fair market value of the Class I through V  assets on the acquisition date to the $740 AGUB allocated to such assets  (which includes the $40 addition to AGUB included during 2006). Thus,  new T recognizes $40 of additional premium as a result of the increase  in reserves during 2007, and adjusts the AGUB allocable to the Class I  through V assets acquired from old T to reflect such additional premium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as Example 2, except  that on January 1, 2008, new T reinsures the outstanding liability with  respect to losses incurred by old T before the acquisition date through  a portfolio reinsurance transaction with R, another non-life insurance  company. R agrees to assume any remaining liability relating to losses  incurred by old T before the acquisition date in exchange for a  reinsurance premium of $200. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008, new T  reports no undiscounted unpaid losses with respect to losses incurred by  old T before the acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. New T must determine whether any amount by which it  increased its unpaid loss reserves will be treated as an additional  premium under paragraph (d) of this section. New T applies the formula  of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, where A equals $500, B equals $625,  C equals $0, and D equals -$150 ($625 - ($575 + $200), and E equals $100  ($80 divided by .8). Thus, new T is treated as having increased its  discounted unpaid losses by $40 in 2008 with respect to losses incurred  by old T before the acquisition date ($500/$625 x (0 -[-$150 + $100]).  New T includes this positive amount in gross income, subject to the  limitation of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The limitation of  paragraph (d)(4) of this section equals $20, which is computed by  comparing the $800 fair market value of the Class I through V assets  acquired from old T   with the $780 AGUB allocated to such assets (which includes the $40  addition to AGUB in 2006 and the $40 addition to AGUB in 2007). Thus,  New T includes $20 in additional premium, and increases the AGUB  allocated to the Class I through V assets acquired from old T by $20. As  a result of these adjustments, the limitation under paragraph (d)(4) of  this section is reduced to zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This section  applies to increases to reserves made by new target after a deemed asset  sale occurring on or after April 10, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application to pre-effective date increases to reserves. If  either new target makes an election under Sec. 1.338(i)-1(c)(2) or old  target makes an election under Sec. 1.338(i)-1(c)(3) to apply the rules  of this section, in whole, to a qualified stock purchase occurring  before April 10, 2006, then the rules contained in this section shall  apply in whole to the qualified stock purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  In general. New target and old target are treated as the same  corporation for purposes of an election by old target to use its  historical loss payment pattern under section 846(e). See Sec. 1.338- 1(b)(2)(vii). Therefore, if old target has a section 846(e) election in  effect on the acquisition date, new target will continue to use the  historical loss payment pattern of old target to discount unpaid losses  incurred in accident years covered by the election, unless new target  elects to revoke the section 846(e) election. In addition, new target  may consider old target's historical loss payment pattern when  determining whether to make the section 846(e) election for a  determination year that includes or is subsequent to the acquisition  date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revocation of existing section 846(e) election. New target may  revoke old target's section 846(e) election to use its historical loss  payment pattern to discount unpaid losses. If new target elects to  revoke old target's section 846(e) election, new target will use the  industry-wide patterns determined by the Secretary to discount unpaid  losses incurred in accident years beginning on or after the acquisition  date through the subsequent determination year. New target may revoke  old target's section 846(e) election by attaching a statement to new  target's original tax return for its first taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effect of section 338 election on old target's capitalization  amounts under section 848--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of net consideration for  specified insurance contracts. For purposes of applying section 848 and  Sec. 1.848-2(f) to the deemed assumption reinsurance transaction, old  target's net consideration (either positive or negative) for each  category of specified insurance contracts is an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The allocable portion of the ceding commission (if any) relating  to contracts in that category; less</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount by which old target's tax reserves for contracts in  that category has been reduced as a result of the deemed assumption  reinsurance transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of capitalization amount. Except as provided in  Sec. 1.381(c)(22)-1(b)(13)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If, after the deemed asset sale, old target has an amount  otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848 for the taxable  year or an unamortized balance of specified policy acquisition expenses  from prior taxable years, then old target deducts such remaining amount  or unamortized balance as an expense incurred in the taxable year that  includes the deemed sale tax consequences; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, after the deemed asset sale, the negative capitalization  amount resulting from the reinsurance transaction exceeds the amount  that old target can deduct under section 848(f)(1), then old target's  capitalization amount is treated as zero at the close of the taxable  year that includes the deemed sale tax consequences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 381 transactions. For transactions described in section  381, see Sec. 1.381(c)(22)-1(b)(13).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effect of section 338 election on policyholders surplus account.  Except as specifically provided in Sec. 1.381(c)(22)-1(b)(7), the  deemed asset sale effects a distribution of old target's policyholders  surplus account to the extent the grossed-up amount realized on the sale  to the purchasing corporation of the purchasing corporation's recently  purchased target stock (as defined in   Sec. 1.338-4(c)) exceeds old target's shareholders surplus account  under section 815(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)(10)</em>-1  Deemed asset sale and liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section prescribes rules for qualification for a  section 338(h)(10) election and for making a section 338(h)(10)  election. This section also prescribes the consequences of such  election. The rules of this section are in addition to the rules of  Sec. Sec. 1.338-1 through 1.338-10 and, in appropriate cases, apply  instead of the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.338-1 through 1.338-10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consolidated target. A consolidated target is a  target that is a member of a consolidated group within the meaning of  Sec. 1.1502-1(h) on the acquisition date and is not the common parent  of the group on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Selling consolidated group. A selling consolidated group is the  consolidated group of which the consolidated target is a member on the  acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Selling affiliate; affiliated target. A selling affiliate is a  domestic corporation that owns on the acquisition date an amount of  stock in a domestic target, which amount of stock is described in  section 1504(a)(2), and does not join in filing a consolidated return  with the target. In such case, the target is an affiliated target.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> S corporation target. An S corporation target is a target that  is an S corporation immediately before the acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> S corporation shareholders. S corporation shareholders are the S  corporation target's shareholders. Unless otherwise indicated, a  reference to S corporation shareholders refers both to S corporation  shareholders who do and those who do not sell their target stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Liquidation. Any reference in this section to a liquidation is  treated as a reference to the transfer described in paragraph (d)(4) of  this section notwithstanding its ultimate characterization for Federal  income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 338(h)(10) election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A section  338(h)(10) election may be made for T if P acquires stock meeting the  requirements of section 1504(a)(2) from a selling consolidated group, a  selling affiliate, or the S corporation shareholders in a qualified  stock purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Availability of section 338(h)(10) election in certain multi- step transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sec.  1.338-3(c)(1)(i), a section 338(h)(10) election may be made for T where  P's acquisition of T stock, viewed independently, constitutes a  qualified stock purchase and, after the stock acquisition, T merges or  liquidates into P (or another member of the affiliated group that  includes P), whether or not, under relevant provisions of law, including  the step transaction doctrine, the acquisition of the T stock and the  merger or liquidation of T qualify as a reorganization described in  section 368(a). If a section 338(h)(10) election is made in a case where  the acquisition of T stock followed by a merger or liquidation of T   into P qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a), for  all Federal tax purposes, P's acquisition of T stock is treated as a  qualified stock purchase and is not treated as part of a reorganization  described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Simultaneous joint election requirement. A section 338(h)(10)  election is made jointly by P and the selling consolidated group (or the  selling affiliate or the S corporation shareholders) on Form 8023 in  accordance with the instructions to the form. S corporation shareholders  who do not sell their stock must also consent to the election. The  section 338(h)(10) election must be made not later than the 15th day of  the 9th month beginning after the month in which the acquisition date  occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Irrevocability. A section 338(h)(10) election is irrevocable. If  a section 338(h)(10) election is made for T, a section 338 election is  deemed made for T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of invalid election. If a section 338(h)(10) election for  T is not valid, the section 338 election for T is also not valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certain consequences of section 338(h)(10) election. For  purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (except as provided  in Sec. 1.338-1(b)(2)), the consequences to the parties of making a  section 338(h)(10) election for T are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> P. P is automatically deemed to have made a gain recognition  election for its nonrecently purchased T stock, if any. The effect of a  gain recognition election includes a taxable deemed sale by P on the  acquisition date of any nonrecently purchased target stock. See Sec.  1.338-5(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> New T. The AGUB for new T's assets is determined under Sec.  1.338-5 and is allocated among the acquisition date assets under  Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(4) of this  section (deemed liquidation of old T), new T remains liable for the tax  liabilities of old T (including the tax liability for the deemed sale  tax consequences). For example, new T remains liable for the tax  liabilities of the members of any consolidated group that are  attributable to taxable years in which those corporations and old T  joined in the same consolidated return. See Sec. 1.1502-6(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Old T--deemed sale--(i) In general. Old T is treated as  transferring all of its assets to an unrelated person in exchange for  consideration that includes the discharge of its liabilities in a single  transaction at the close of the acquisition date (but before the deemed  liquidation). See Sec. 1.338-1(a) regarding the tax characterization of  the deemed asset sale. Except as provided in Sec. 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(8)  (regarding the installment method), old T recognizes all of the gain  realized on the deemed transfer of its assets in consideration for the  ADSP. ADSP for old T is determined under Sec. 1.338-4 and allocated  among the acquisition date assets under Sec. Sec. 1.338-6 and 1.338-7.  Old T realizes the deemed sale tax consequences from the deemed asset  sale before the close of the acquisition date while old T is a member of  the selling consolidated group (or owned by the selling affiliate or  owned by the S corporation shareholders). If T is an affiliated target,  or an S corporation target, the principles of Sec. Sec. 1.338-2(c)(10)  and 1.338-10(a)(1), (5), and (6)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> apply to the return on which the  deemed sale tax consequences are reported. When T is an S corporation  target, T's S election continues in effect through the close of the  acquisition date (including the time of the deemed asset sale and the  deemed liquidation) notwithstanding section 1362(d)(2)(B). Also, when T  is an S corporation target (but not a qualified subchapter S  subsidiary), any direct and indirect subsidiaries of T which T has  elected to treat as qualified subchapter S subsidiaries under section  1361(b)(3) remain qualified subchapter S subsidiaries through the close  of the acquisition date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making elections under section 338(h)(10), the deemed asset  sale of a parent corporation is considered to precede that of its  subsidiary. See Sec. 1.338-3(b)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Old T and selling consolidated group, selling affiliate, or S  corporation shareholders--deemed liquidation; tax characterization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. Old T is treated as if, before the close of the acquisition  date, after the deemed asset sale in paragraph (d)(3) of this section,   and while old T is a member of the selling consolidated group (or owned  by the selling affiliate or owned by the S corporation shareholders), it  transferred all of its assets to members of the selling consolidated  group, the selling affiliate, or S corporation shareholders and ceased  to exist. The transfer from old T is characterized for Federal income  tax purposes in the same manner as if the parties had actually engaged  in the transactions deemed to occur because of this section and taking  into account other transactions that actually occurred or are deemed to  occur. For example, the transfer may be treated as a distribution in  pursuance of a plan of reorganization, a distribution in complete  cancellation or redemption of all its stock, one of a series of  distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock in  accordance with a plan of liquidation, or part of a circular flow of  cash. In most cases, the transfer will be treated as a distribution in  complete liquidation to which section 336 or 337 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tiered targets. In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of  corporations making elections under section 338(h)(10), the deemed  liquidation of a subsidiary corporation is considered to precede the  deemed liquidation of its parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Selling consolidated group, selling affiliate, or S corporation  shareholders--(i) In general. If T is an S corporation target, S  corporation shareholders (whether or not they sell their stock) take  their pro rata share of the deemed sale tax consequences into account  under section 1366 and increase or decrease their basis in T stock under  section 1367. Members of the selling consolidated group, the selling  affiliate, or S corporation shareholders are treated as if, after the  deemed asset sale in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and before the  close of the acquisition date, they received the assets transferred by  old T in the transaction described in paragraph (d)(4)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  section. In most cases, the transfer will be treated as a distribution  in complete liquidation to which section 331 or 332 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis and holding period of T stock not acquired. A member of  the selling consolidated group (or the selling affiliate or an S  corporation shareholder) retaining T stock is treated as acquiring the  stock so retained on the day after the acquisition date for its fair  market value. The holding period for the retained stock starts on the  day after the acquisition date. For purposes of this paragraph, the fair  market value of all of the T stock equals the grossed-up amount realized  on the sale to P of P's recently purchased target stock. See Sec.  1.338-4(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> T stock sale. Members of the selling consolidated group (or  the selling affiliate or S corporation shareholders) recognize no gain  or loss on the sale or exchange of T stock included in the qualified  stock purchase (although they may recognize gain or loss on the T stock  in the deemed liquidation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Nonselling minority shareholders other than nonselling S  corporation shareholders--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This paragraph (d)(6)  describes the treatment of shareholders of old T other than the  following: Members of the selling consolidated group, the selling  affiliate, S corporation shareholders (whether or not they sell their  stock), and P. For a description of the treatment of S corporation  shareholders, see paragraph (d)(5) of this section. A shareholder to  which this paragraph (d)(6) applies is called a minority shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> T stock sale. A minority shareholder recognizes gain or loss on  the shareholder's sale or exchange of T stock included in the qualified  stock purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> T stock not acquired. A minority shareholder does not  recognize gain or loss under this section with respect to shares of T  stock retained by the shareholder. The shareholder's basis and holding  period for that T stock is not affected by the section 338(h)(10)  election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Consolidated return of selling consolidated group. If P acquires  T in a qualified stock purchase from a selling consolidated group--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The selling consolidated group must file a consolidated return  for the taxable period that includes the acquisition date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A consolidated return for the selling consolidated group for  that period may not be withdrawn on or after the   day that a section 338(h)(10) election is made for T; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Permission to discontinue filing consolidated returns cannot  be granted for, and cannot apply to, that period or any of the  immediately preceding taxable periods during which consolidated returns  continuously have been filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Availability of the section 453 installment method. Solely for  purposes of applying sections 453, 453A, and 453B, and the regulations  thereunder (the installment method) to determine the consequences to old  T in the deemed asset sale and to old T (and its shareholders, if  relevant) in the deemed liquidation, the rules in paragraphs (d)(1)  through (7) of this section are modified as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In deemed asset sale. Old T is treated as receiving in the  deemed asset sale new T installment obligations, the terms of which are  identical (except as to the obligor) to P installment obligations issued  in exchange for recently purchased stock of T. Old T is treated as  receiving in cash all other consideration in the deemed asset sale other  than the assumption of, or taking subject to, old T liabilities. For  example, old T is treated as receiving in cash any amounts attributable  to the grossing-up of amount realized under Sec. 1.338-4(c). The amount  realized for recently purchased stock taken into account in determining  ADSP is adjusted (and, thus, ADSP is redetermined) to reflect the  amounts paid under an installment obligation for the stock when the  total payments under the installment obligation are greater or less than  the amount realized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In deemed liquidation. Old T is treated as distributing in the  deemed liquidation the new T installment obligations that it is treated  as receiving in the deemed asset sale. The members of the selling  consolidated group, the selling affiliate, or the S corporation  shareholders are treated as receiving in the deemed liquidation the new  T installment obligations that correspond to the P installment  obligations they actually received individually in exchange for their  recently purchased stock. The new T installment obligations may be  recharacterized under other rules. See for example Sec. 1.453-11(a)(2)  which, in certain circumstances, treats the new T installment  obligations deemed distributed by old T as if they were issued by new T  in exchange for the stock in old T owned by members of the selling  consolidated group, the selling affiliate, or the S corporation  shareholders. The members of the selling consolidated group, the selling  affiliate, or the S corporation shareholders are treated as receiving  all other consideration in the deemed liquidation in cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Treatment consistent with an actual asset sale. No provision in  section 338(h)(10) or this section shall produce a Federal income tax  result under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code that would not  occur if the parties had actually engaged in the transactions deemed to  occur because of this section and taking into account other transactions  that actually occurred or are deemed to occur. See, however, Sec.  1.338-1(b)(2) for certain exceptions to this rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S1 owns all of the T stock and T owns all of the  stock of T1 and T2. S1 is the common parent of a consolidated group that  includes T, T1, and T2. P makes a qualified stock purchase of all of the  T stock from S1. S1 joins with P in making a section 338(h)(10) election  for T and for the deemed purchase of T1. A section 338 election is not  made for T2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S1 does not recognize gain or loss on the sale of the T stock  and T does not recognize gain or loss on the sale of the T1 stock  because section 338(h)(10) elections are made for T and T1. Thus, for  example, gain or loss realized on the sale of the T or T1 stock is not  taken into account in earnings and profits. However, because a section  338 election is not made for T2, T must recognize any gain or loss  realized on the deemed sale of the T2 stock. See Sec. 1.338-4(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The results would be the same if S1, T, T1, and T2 are not  members of any consolidated group, because S1 and T are selling  affiliates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S and T are solvent corporations. S owns all of the  outstanding stock of T. S and P agree to undertake the following  transaction: T will distribute half its assets to S, and S will assume  half of T's liabilities. Then, P will purchase the stock of T from S. S  and P will jointly make a section 338(h)(10) election with respect to  the sale of T. The corporations then complete the transaction as agreed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 338(a), the assets present in T at the close of  the acquisition date are deemed sold by old T to new T. Under paragraph  (d)(4) of this section, the transactions described in paragraph (d) of  this section are treated in the same manner as if they had actually  occurred. Because S and P had agreed that, after T's actual distribution  to S of part of its assets, S would sell T to P pursuant to an election  under section 338(h)(10), and because paragraph (d)(4) of this section  deems T subsequently to have transferred all its assets to its  shareholder, T is deemed to have adopted a plan of complete liquidation  under section 332. T's actual transfer of assets to S is treated as a  distribution pursuant to that plan of complete liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S1 owns all of the outstanding stock of both T and  S2. All three are corporations. S1 and P agree to undertake the  following transaction. T will transfer substantially all of its assets  and liabilities to S2, with S2 issuing no stock in exchange therefor,  and retaining its other assets and liabilities. Then, P will purchase  the stock of T from S1. S1 and P will jointly make a section 338(h)(10)  election with respect to the sale of T. The corporations then complete  the transaction as agreed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under section 338(a), the remaining assets present in T at the  close of the acquisition date are deemed sold by old T to new T. Under  paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the transactions described in this  section are treated in the same manner as if they had actually occurred.  Because old T transferred substantially all of its assets to S2, and is  deemed to have distributed all its remaining assets and gone out of  existence, the transfer of assets to S2, taking into account the related  transfers, deemed and actual, qualifies as a reorganization under  section 368(a)(1)(D). Section 361(c)(1) and not section 332 applies to  T's deemed liquidation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T owns two assets: an actively traded security (Class  II) with a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted basis of $100, and  inventory (Class IV) with a fair market value of $100 and an adjusted  basis of $100. T has no liabilities. S is negotiating to sell all the  stock in T to P for $100 cash and contingent consideration. Assume that  under generally applicable tax accounting rules, P's adjusted basis in  the T stock immediately after the purchase would be $100, because the  contingent consideration is not taken into account. Thus, under the  rules of Sec. 1.338-5, AGUB would be $100. Under the allocation rules  of Sec. 1.338-6, the entire $100 would be allocated to the Class II  asset, the actively traded security, and no amount would be allocated to  the inventory. P, however, plans immediately to cause T to sell the  inventory, but not the actively traded security, so it requests that,  prior to the stock sale, S cause T to create a new subsidiary, Newco,  and contribute the actively traded security to the capital of Newco.  Because the stock in Newco, which would not be actively traded, is a  Class V asset, under the rules of Sec. 1.338-6 $100 of AGUB would be  allocated to the inventory and no amount of AGUB would be allocated to  the Newco stock. Newco's own AGUB, $0 under the rules of Sec. 1.338-5,  would be allocated to the actively traded security. When P subsequently  causes T to sell the inventory, T would realize no gain or loss instead  of realizing gain of $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that, if the T stock had not itself been sold but T had  instead sold both its inventory and the Newco stock to P, T would for  tax purposes be deemed instead to have sold both its inventory and  actively traded security directly to P, with P deemed then to have  created Newco and contributed the actively traded security to the  capital of Newco. Section 338, if elected, generally recharacterizes a  stock sale as a deemed sale of assets. However, paragraph (d)(9) of this  section states, in general, that no provision of section 338(h)(10) or  the regulations thereunder shall produce a Federal income tax result  under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code that would not occur if  the parties had actually engaged in the transactions deemed to occur by  virtue of the section 338(h)(10) election, taking into account other  transactions that actually occurred or are deemed to occur. Hence, the  deemed sale of assets under section 338(h)(10) should be treated as one  of the inventory and actively traded security themselves, not of the  inventory and Newco stock. The anti-abuse rule of Sec. 1.338-1(c) does  not apply, because the substance of the deemed sale of assets is a sale  of the inventory and the actively traded security themselves, not of the  inventory and the Newco stock. Otherwise, the anti-abuse rule might  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> T, a member of a selling consolidated group, has only  one class of stock, all of which is owned by S1. On March 1 of Year 2,  S1 sells its T stock to P for $80,000, and joins with P in making a  section 338(h)(10) election for T. There are no selling costs or  acquisition costs. On March 1 of Year 2, T owns land with a $50,000  basis and $75,000 fair market value and equipment with a $30,000  adjusted basis, $70,000 recomputed basis, and $60,000 fair market value.  T also has a $40,000 liability.

T's sole asset is real estate, which has a  value of   $110,000 and an adjusted basis of $35,000. Also, T's real estate is  encumbered by long-outstanding purchase-money indebtedness of $10,000.  The real estate does not have built-in gain subject to section 1374. A,  B, and C join with P in making a section 338(h)(10) election for T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solely for purposes of application of sections 453, 453A, and  453B, old T is considered in its deemed asset sale to receive back from  new T the $25,000 note (considered issued by new T) and $75,000 of cash  (total consideration of $80,000 paid for all the stock sold, which is  then divided by .80 in the grossing-up, with the resulting figure of  $100,000 then reduced by the amount of the installment note). Absent an  election under section 453(d), gain is reported by old T under the  installment method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In applying the installment method to old T's deemed asset  sale, the contract price for old T's assets deemed sold is $100,000, the  $110,000 selling price reduced by the indebtedness of $10,000 to which  the assets are subject. (The $110,000 selling price is itself the sum of  the $80,000 grossed-up in paragraph (ii) above to $100,000 and the  $10,000 liability.) Gross profit is $75,000 ($110,000 selling price -  old T's basis of $35,000). Old T's gross profit ratio is 0.75 (gross  profit of $75,000 / $100,000 contract price). Thus, $56,250 (0.75 x the  $75,000 cash old T is deemed to receive in Year 1) is Year 1 gain  attributable to the sale, and $18,750 ($75,000 - $56,250) is recovery of  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In its liquidation, old T is deemed to distribute the $25,000  note to B, since B actually sold the stock partly for that  consideration. To the extent of the remaining liquidating distribution  to B, it is deemed to receive, along with A and C, the balance of old  T's liquidating assets in the form of cash. Under section 453(h), B,  unless it makes an election under section 453(d), is not required to  treat the receipt of the note as a payment for the T stock; P's payment  of the $25,000 note in Year 7 to B is a payment for the T stock. Because  section 453(h) applies to B, old T's deemed liquidating distribution of  the note is, under section 453B(h), not treated as a taxable disposition  by old T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under section 1366, A reports 40 percent, or $22,500, of old T's  $56,250 gain recognized in Year 1. Under section 1367, this increases  A's $10,000 adjusted basis in the T stock to $32,500. Next, in old T's  deemed liquidation, A is considered to receive $40,000 for its old T  shares, causing it to recognize an additional $7,500 gain in Year 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Under section 1366, B reports 40 percent, or $22,500, of old  T's $56,250 gain recognized in Year 1. Under section 1367, this  increases B's $10,000 adjusted basis in its T stock to $32,500. Next, in  old T's deemed liquidation, B is considered to receive the $25,000 note  and $15,000 of other consideration. Applying section 453, including  section 453(h), to the deemed liquidation, B's selling price and  contract price are both $40,000. Gross profit is $7,500 ($40,000 selling  price - B's basis of $32,500). B's gross profit ratio is 0.1875 (gross  profit of $7,500 / $40,000 contract price). Thus, $2,812.50 (0.1875 x  $15,000) is Year 1 gain attributable to the deemed liquidation. In Year  7, when the $25,000 note is paid, B has $4,687.50 (0.1875 x $25,000) of  additional gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Under section 1366, C reports 20 percent, or $11,250, of old  T's $56,250 gain recognized in Year 1. Under section 1367, this  increases C's $5,000 adjusted basis in its T stock to $16,250. Next, in  old T's deemed liquidation, C is considered to receive $20,000 for its  old T shares, causing it to recognize an additional $3,750 gain in Year  1. Finally, under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, C is considered  to acquire its stock in T on the day after the acquisition date for  $20,000 (fair market value = grossed-up amount realized of $100,000 x  20%). C's holding period in the stock deemed received in new T begins at  that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P owns all the stock of Y, a newly  formed subsidiary. S owns all the stock of T. Each of P, S, T and Y is a  domestic corporation. P acquires all of the T stock in a statutory  merger of Y into T, with T surviving. In the merger, S receives  consideration consisting of 50% P voting stock and 50% cash. Viewed  independently of any other step, P's acquisition of T stock constitutes  a qualified stock purchase. As part of the plan that includes P's  acquisition of the T stock, T subsequently merges into P. Viewed  independently of any other step, T's merger into P qualifies as a  liquidation described in section 332. Absent the application of  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the step transaction doctrine would  apply to treat P's acquisition of the T stock and T's merger into P as  an acquisition by P of T's assets in a reorganization described in  section 368(a). P and S do not make a section 338(h)(10) election with  respect to P's purchase of the T stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because P and S do not make an election under section  338(h)(10) for T, P's acquisition of the T stock and T's merger into P  is treated as part of a reorganization described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 11  except that P and S make a joint election under section 338(h)(10) for  T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as a result of  the election under section 338(h)(10), for all Federal tax purposes, P's  acquisition of the T stock is treated as a qualified stock purchase and  P's acquisition of the T stock is not treated as part of a  reorganization described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in  Example 12, except that, following P's acquisition of the T stock, T  merges into X, a domestic corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary  of P. Viewed independently of any other step, T's merger into X  qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a). Absent the  application of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the step transaction  doctrine would apply to treat P's acquisition of the T stock and T's  merger into X as an acquisition by X of T's assets in a reorganization  described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as a result of  the election under section 338(h)(10), for all Federal tax purposes, P's  acquisition of T stock is treated as a qualified stock purchase and P's  acquisition of T stock is not treated as part of a reorganization  described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same  as in Example 11, except that, in the statutory merger of Y into T, S  receives only P voting stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 1.338-3(c)(1)(i) and paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, no election under section 338(h)(10) can be made with respect  to P's acquisition of the T stock because, pursuant to relevant  provisions of law, including the step transaction doctrine, that  acquisition followed by T's merger into P is treated as a reorganization  described in section 368(a)(1)(A), and that acquisition, viewed  independently of T's merger into P, does not constitute a qualified  stock purchase under section 338(d)(3). Accordingly, P's acquisition of  the T stock and T's merger into P is treated as a reorganization  described in section 368(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Inapplicability of provisions. The provisions of section 6043,  Sec. Sec. 1.331-1(d) and 1.332-6 (relating to information returns and  recordkeeping requirements for corporate liquidations) do not apply to  the deemed liquidation of old T under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Required information.
