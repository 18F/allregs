                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An employee vested dual benefit is payable, in addition  to tiers I and II, to an employee who meets one of the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employee worked in the railroad industry in 1974. An employee  who worked for a railroad in 1974 and retired after 1974 is considered  vested if on December 31, 1974, he or she had both 10 years of railroad  service and sufficient quarters of coverage under the Social Security  Act to qualify for a social security benefit. An employee qualified on  this basis is eligible for vested dual benefit amounts computed on his  or her railroad and social security credits through December 31, 1974.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employee who did not work for a railroad in 1974. An employee  who did not work in the railroad industry in 1974, but who had 25 or  more years of railroad service before 1975 or a current connection with  the railroad industry on December 31, 1974, as defined in part 216 of  this chapter, or a current connection when he or she retired, is also  considered vested under the same conditions as an employee who had  worked in the railroad industry in 1974.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An employee who completed 10 years or more years of railroad  service (but less than 25) before 1975 but left the industry before 1975  and did not have a current connection on December 31, 1974 or when he or  she retired. Such an employee is considered vested only if he or she had  sufficient social security quarters of coverage to qualify for a social  security retirement benefit as of the end of the year prior to 1975 in  which he or she left the railroad industry. The vested dual benefit  amount is based only on credits acquired through the last year of pre- 1975 railroad service instead of through December 31, 1974.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation. The employee vested dual benefit is computed as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The combined earnings dual benefit PIA is subtracted from the  total of the railroad earnings dual benefit PIA and the social security  earnings dual benefit PIA (see part 225 of this chapter for an  explanation of these PIA's).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The result from paragraph (b)(l) of this section is adjusted for  any applicable cost-of-living increase, as shown in Sec. 226.13 of this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the employee is entitled to a reduced age annuity (see Sec.  216.1 of this chapter), the rate from paragraph (b)(2) of this section  is reduced in the same manner as the tier I as provided for in Sec.  226.10 of this part. In the case of an employee with 30 years of service  who is entitled to an annuity reduced for age, the age reduction applies  only to the tier I component; no age reduction applies to the vested  dual benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The vested dual benefit payable in a given year may also be  reduced for insufficient funding as shown in part 233 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3">Example: An employee born on November 3, 1919, becomes entitled to  an annuity including a vested dual benefit on October 1, 1982. His  combined earnings dual benefit PIA is $254.90, his railroad earnings  dual benefit PIA is $93.80, and his social security earnings dual  benefit PIA is $244.70. The vested dual benefit before cost-of-living  increase is $83.60 ($93.80 + $244.70 -$254.90 = $83.60). A cost-of- living increase of $67.72 (81 percent of $83.60. See Sec. 226.13 of  this part) results in a vested dual benefit of $151.32. Retirement age  for a person born in 1919 is age 65. Since the employee is 25 months  under age 65 when the annuity begins, $151.32 is multiplied by 25/180,  to produce an age reduction of $21.02 and a vested dual benefit rate  after age reduction of $130.30.</p>
