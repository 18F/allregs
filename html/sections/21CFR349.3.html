A drug product, which should be sterile  in accordance with Sec. 200.50, to be applied to the eyelid or  instilled in the eye.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Astringent. A locally acting pharmacologic agent which, by  precipitating protein, helps to clear mucus from the outer surface of  the eye.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Buffering agent. A substance which stabilizes the pH of  solutions against changes produced by introduction of acids or bases  from such sources as drugs, body fluids, tears, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Demulcent. An agent, usually a water-soluble polymer, which is  applied topically to the eye to protect and lubricate mucous membrane  surfaces and relieve dryness and irritation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Emollient.

Applied topically to the eye, a hypertonicity agent creates an osmotic  gradient which draws water out of the cornea.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Isotonicity. A state or quality in which the osmotic pressure in  two fluids is equal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Vasoconstrictor. A pharmacologic agent which, when applied  topically to the mucous membranes of the eye, causes transient  constriction of conjunctival blood vessels.</p>
