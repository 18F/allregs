                                Sec. 1.1082-3  Reduction of basis of property by reason of gain not
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introductory. In addition to the adjustments provided in section 1016 and other applicable provisions of chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations relating thereto, which are required to be made with respect to the cost or other basis of property, section 1082(a)(2) provides that a further adjustment shall be made in any case in which there shall have been a nonrecognition of gain under section 1081(b). Such further adjustment shall be made with respect to the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor immediately after the transfer and of the property acquired within 24 months after such transfer by an expenditure or investment to which section 1081(b) relates, and on account of which expenditure or investment gain is not recognized. If the property is in the hands of the transferor immediately after the transfer, the time of reduction is the day of the transfer; in all other cases the time of reduction is the date of acquisition. The effect of applying an amount in reduction of basis of property under section 1081 (b) is to reduce by such amount the basis for determining gain upon sale or other disposition, the basis for determining loss upon sale or other disposition, the basis for depreciation and for depletion, and any other amount which the Code prescribes shall be the same as any of such bases. For the purposes of the application of an amount in reduction of basis under section 1081(b), property is not considered as having a basis capable of reduction if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is money, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If its adjusted basis for determining gain at the time the reduction is to be made is zero, or becomes zero at any time in the application of section 1081 (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General rule. (1) Section 1082 (a)(2) sets forth seven categories of property, the basis of which for determining gain or loss shall be reduced in the order stated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 1082 (a)(2) sets forth seven categories of property, the basis of which for determining gain or loss shall be reduced in the order stated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any of the property in the first category has a basis capable of reduction, the reduction must first be made before applying an amount in reduction of the basis of any property in the second or in a succeeding category, to each of which in turn a similar rule is applied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the application of the rule to each category, the amount of the gain not recognized shall be applied to reduce the cost or other basis of all the property in the category as follows: The cost or other basis (at the time immediately after the transfer or, if the property is not then held but is thereafter acquired, at the time of such acquisition) of each unit of property in the first category shall be decreased (but the amount of the decrease shall not be more than the amount of the adjusted basis at such time for determining gain, determined without regard to this section) in an amount equal to such proportion of the unrecognized gain as the adjusted basis (for determining gain, determined without regard to this section) at such time of each unit of property of the taxpayer in that category bears to the aggregate of the adjusted basis (for determining gain, computed without regard to this section) at such time of all the property of the taxpayer in that category. When such adjusted basis of the property in the first category has been thus reduced to zero, a similar rule shall be applied, with respect to the portion of such gain which is unabsorbed in such reduction of the basis of the property in such category, in reducing the basis of the property in the second category. A similar rule with respect to the remaining unabsorbed gain shall be applied in reducing the basis of the property in the next succeeding category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special cases. (1) With the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may, however, have the basis of the various units of property within a particular category specified in section 1082(a)(2) adjusted in a manner different from the general rule set forth

in paragraph (b) of this section. Variations from such general rule may, for example, involve adjusting the basis of only certain units of the taxpayer's property within a given category. A request for variations from the general rule should be filed by the taxpayer with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the transfer of property has occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With the consent of the Commissioner, the taxpayer may, however, have the basis of the various units of property within a particular category specified in section 1082(a)(2) adjusted in a manner different from the general rule set forth

in paragraph (b) of this section. Variations from such general rule may, for example, involve adjusting the basis of only certain units of the taxpayer's property within a given category. A request for variations from the general rule should be filed by the taxpayer with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the transfer of property has occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agreement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner as to any variations from such general rule shall be effective only if incorporated in a closing agreement entered into under the provisions of section 7121. If no such agreement is entered into by the taxpayer and the Commissioner, then the consent filed on Form 982 shall (except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph) be deemed to be a consent to the application of such general rule, and such general rule shall apply in the determination of the basis of the taxpayer's property. If, however, the taxpayer specifically states on such form that it does not consent to the application of the general rule, then, in the absence of a closing agreement, the document filed shall not be deemed a consent within the meaning of section 1081(b)(4).
