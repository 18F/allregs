Sec.  63.685 through 63.689 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator removes or destroys HAP in the off-site  material before placing the material in the off-site material management  unit by treating the material in accordance with the standards specified  in Sec.  63.684 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator determines before placing off-site  material in the off-site material management unit that the average VOHAP  concentration of the off-site material is less than 500 parts per  million by weight (ppmw) at the point-of-delivery. The owner or operator  must perform an initial determination of the average VOHAP concentration  of the off-site material using the procedures specified in Sec.   63.694(b) of this subpart. This initial determination must be performed  either before the first time any portion of the off-site material stream  is placed in the unit or by the compliance date, whichever date is  later. Thereafter, the owner or operator must review and update, as  necessary, this determination at least once every calendar year  following the date of the initial determination for the off-site  material stream.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iv)</em> of this section as applicable to the unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An off-site material management unit is exempted from the  requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the off-site  material management unit is also subject to another subpart under 40 CFR  part 63 or 40 CFR part 61, and the owner or operator is controlling the  HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart that are emitted from the unit in  compliance with the provisions specified in the other applicable subpart  under part 61 or part 63.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator must designate each of the off-site  material management units selected by the owner or operator to be exempt  under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section by either submitting to the  Administrator a written notification identifying the exempt-units or  permanently marking the exempt-units at the plant site. If an owner or  operator chooses to prepare and submit a written notification, this  notification must include a site plan, process diagram, or other  appropriate documentation identifying each of the exempt-units. If an  owner or operator chooses to permanently mark the exempt-units, each  exempt-unit must be marked in such a manner that it can be readily  identified as an exempt-unit from the other off-site material management  units located at the plant site.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The owner or operator must prepare an initial determination of  the total annual HAP quantity in the off-site material placed in the  units exempted under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii). This determination is  based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart  as determined at the point where the off-site material is placed in each  exempted unit. The owner or operator must perform a new determination  whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the  off-site material placed in the exempted units could cause the total  annual HAP content in the off-site material to exceed 1 megagram per  year. The owner or operator must maintain documentation to support the  most recent determination of the total annual HAP quantity. This  documentation must include the basis and data used for determining the  HAP content of the off-site material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(B)</em> of this section and the owner  or operator complies with the monitoring requirements in Sec.   63.684(e)(4) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The HAP biodegradation efficiency (Rbio) for the  biological treatment process is equal to or greater than 95 percent.

The required HAP mass  removal rate (RMR) must be determined in accordance with the  requirements of Sec.  63.694(e) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)(B)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The hazardous waste meets the numerical organic concentration  limits, applicable to the hazardous waste, as specified in 40 CFR part  268--Land Disposal Restrictions, listed in the table, ``Treatment  Standards for Hazardous Waste'' in 40 CFR 268.40.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The organic hazardous constituents in the hazardous waste have  been treated by the treatment technology established by the EPA for the  hazardous waste in 40 CFR 268.42(a), or have been removed or destroyed  by an equivalent method of treatment approved by the EPA under 40 CFR  268.42(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)(C)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The tank is located inside an enclosure vented to a control  device that is designed and operated in accordance with all applicable  requirements specified under 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF--National  Emission Standards for Benzene Waste Operations for a facility at which  the total annual benzene quantity from the facility waste is equal to or  greater than 10 megagrams per year;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The enclosure and control device serving the tank were installed  and began operation prior to July 1, 1996; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The enclosure is designed and operated in accordance with the  criteria for a permanent total enclosure as specified in ``Procedure T-- Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total  Enclosure'' under 40 CFR 52.741, appendix B. The enclosure may have  permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access; passage of  material into or out of the enclosure by conveyor, vehicles, or other  mechanical or electrical equipment; or to direct air flow into the  enclosure. The owner or operator must annually perform the verification  procedure for the enclosure as specified in Section 5.0 to ``Procedure  T--Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total  Enclosure.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section except for  those process vents exempted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator controls air emissions from the process  vent in accordance with the standards specified in Sec.  63.690 of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator determines before placing off-site  material in the process equipment associated with the process vent that  the average VOHAP concentration of the off-site material is less than  500 ppmw at the point-of-delivery. The owner or operator must perform an  initial determination of the average VOHAP concentration of the off-site  material using the procedures specified in Sec.  63.694(b) of this  subpart before any portion of the off-site material stream is placed in  the unit.

The process vent stream flow rate shall be determined in  accordance with the procedures specified in Sec.  63.694(m) of this  subpart. Documentation must be prepared by the owner or operator and  maintained at the plant site to support the determination of the process  vent stream flow rate. This documentation must include identification of  each process vent exempted under this paragraph and the test results  used to determine the process vent stream flow rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> and the test  results used to determine the process vent stream flow rate and total  HAP concentration. The owner or operator must perform a new  determination of the process vent stream flow rate and total HAP  concentration when the extent of changes to operation of the unit on  which the process vent is used could cause either the process vent  stream flow rate to exceed the limit of 6.0 m\3\/min or the total HAP  concentration to exceed the limit of 20 ppmv.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equipment leaks.
