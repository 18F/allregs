You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of our credit  union at (insert address) on (insert time and date).</p><p class="depth2">Purpose of Meeting</p><p class="depth2">The meeting has two purposes:</p><p class="depth2">1. To consider and act upon a proposal to merge our credit union  with (insert name of continuing credit union), the continuing credit  union.</p><p class="depth2">2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors of our credit  union in authorizing the officers of the credit union, subject to member  approval, to carry out the proposed merger.</p><p class="depth2">If this merger is approved, our credit union will transfer all its  assets and liabilities to the continuing credit union. As a member of  our credit union, you will become a member of the continuing credit  union. On the effective date of the merger, you will receive shares in  the continuing credit union for the shares you own now in our credit  union.</p><p class="depth2">Insurance Conversion</p><p class="depth2">Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the  National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal  government. The basic federal coverage is up   to $100,000, but accounts may be structured in different ways, such as  joint accounts, payable-on-death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve  federal coverage of much more than $100,000. If the merger is approved,  your federal insurance will terminate on the effective date of the  merger. Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to  $(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation  chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance  provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the  full faith and credit of the United States government. The private  insurance you will receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is  not guaranteed by the federal or any state or local government.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">IF THIS MERGER IS APPROVED AND THE (insert name of continuing</p><p class="depth2">credit union) FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT</p><p class="depth2">GUARANTEE YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.</p><p class="depth2">------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Also, because this merger, if approved, would result in the loss of  federal share insurance, the (insert name of merging credit union) will,  at any time between the approval of the merger and the effective date of  merger and upon request of the member, permit all members who have share  certificates or other term accounts to close the federally-insured  portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal penalty. (This is  an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the approval of the  Regional Director. The members must be informed about this right,  however, as described in 12 CFR 708b.204(c).)</p><p class="depth2">Other Information Related to the Proposed Merger</p><p class="depth2">The directors of the participating credit unions carefully analyzed  the assets and liabilities of the participating credit unions and  appraised each credit union's share values.
