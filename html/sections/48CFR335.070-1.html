                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contracting activities shall encourage performing organizations to contribute to the cost of performing R & D, through the use of cost-sharing contracts, where there is a probability that the contractor will receive present or future benefits from participation, such as increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of equipment, and use of background knowledge in future contracts. Cost-sharing is intended to serve the mutual interests of the Government and the performing organization by helping to ensure efficient utilization of the resources available for the conduct of R & D projects and by promoting sound planning and prudent fiscal policies of the performing organization. The Contracting Officer shall use a cost-sharing contract, unless the Contracting Officer determines that a request for cost-sharing would not be appropriate because of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The particular R & D objective or scope of effort for the project is specified by the Government rather than proposed by the performing organization. This would usually include any formal Government solicitation for a specific project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The R & D effort has only minor relevance to the non-Federal activities of the performing organization, and the organization is proposing to undertake the R & D primarily as a service to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The organization has little or no non-Federal sources or funds from which to make a cost contribution. Organizations which are predominantly engaged in R & D and have little or no production or other service activities may not be in a favorable position to make a cost contribution. Accordingly, the Contracting Officer shall normally not request cost-sharing, if cost-sharing would require the Government to provide funds through some other means (such as fees) to enable the organization to cost-share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contracting Officer has the responsibility for negotiating cost-sharing. Each R & D contract file shall indicate whether the Contracting Officer considered cost-sharing appropriate for that particular contract and in what amount. If cost sharing was not appropriate, the file must include a statement and factual basis for that decision (e.g., ``Because the contractor will derive no benefits from this award that can be applied to its commercial activities, cost-sharing is not considered appropriate.'') The Contracting Officer shall coordinate with the Project Officer before documenting this decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Contracting Officer considers cost-sharing appropriate for an R & D contract and the contractor refuses to accept this type of contract, the Contracting Officer may make an award without cost-sharing, if the Contracting Officer concludes that payment of the full cost of the R & D effort is necessary to obtain the services of that particular contractor.</p>
