The provisions of this section are  applicable to certain elections to receive educational assistance under  38 U.S.C. ch. 30. For time limits governing formal and informal claims  for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30, see Sec. 21.1033.

A delay in  submitting the $1,200 may result in a later effective date for the award  to the individual, and in no event will VA accept payment of the $1,200  from the individual after the last date of eligibility as determined by  Sec. 21.7050 or Sec. 21.7051.
