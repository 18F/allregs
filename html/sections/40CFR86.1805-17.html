                                Sec. 86.1805-17  Useful life.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provisions. The useful life values specified in this  section apply for all exhaust, evaporative, refueling, and OBD emission  requirements described in this subpart, except for standards that are  specified to apply only at certification. These useful life requirements  also apply to all air conditioning leakage credits, air conditioning  efficiency credits, and other credit programs used by the manufacturer  to comply with the fleet-average CO2 emission standards in  Sec. 86.1818. Useful life values are specified as a given number of  calendar years or miles of driving, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Greenhouse gas pollutants. The emission standards in  Sec. 86.1818 apply for a useful life of 10 years or 120,000 miles for  LDV and LLDT and 11 years or 120,000 miles for HLDT and MDPV.  Manufacturers may alternatively certify based on a longer useful life as  specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cold temperature emission standards. The cold temperature NMHC  emission standards in Sec. 86.1811 apply for a useful life of 10 years  or 120,000 miles for LDV and LLDT, and 11 years or 120,000 miles for  HLDT and HDV. The cold temperature CO emission standards in Sec. 86.1811  apply for a useful life of 5 years or 50,000 miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Intermediate useful life. Where exhaust emission standards are  specified for an intermediate useful life, these standards apply for  five years or 50,000 miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Interim provisions. The useful life provisions of Sec. 86.1805- 12 apply for vehicles not yet subject to Tier 3 requirements. For  example, vehicles above 6,000 pounds GVWR are not subject to the useful  life provisions in this section until model year 2019 unless  manufacturers voluntarily certify to the Tier 3 requirements earlier  than the regulations require. Also, where the transition to Tier 3  standards involves a phase-in percentage for a given standard, vehicles  not included as part of the phase-in portion of the fleet continue to be  subject to the useful life provisions of Sec. 86.1805-12 with respect to  that standard. The useful life values for a set of vehicles may be  different for exhaust and evaporative emission standards in 2021 and  earlier model years; if   vehicles have different useful life values for evaporative and exhaust  emission standards, the evaporative useful life applies for the OBD  requirements related to the leak standard and the exhaust useful life  applies for all other OBD requirements.
