Any material processed by the general licensee that alters the chemical  or physical form of the material containing source material must be  accounted for as a dispersible form. A person authorized to possess,  use, and transfer source material under this paragraph may not receive  more than a total of 7 kg (15.4 lb) of uranium and thorium in any one  calendar year. Persons possessing source material in excess of these  limits as of August 27, 2013, may continue to possess up to 7 kg (15.4  lb) of uranium and thorium at any one time for one year beyond this  date, or until the Commission takes final action on a pending  application submitted on or before August 27, 2014, for a specific  license for such material; and receive up to 70 kg (154 lb) of uranium  or thorium in any one calendar year until December 31, 2014, or until  the Commission takes final action on a pending application submitted on  or before August 27, 2014, for a specific license for such material; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No more than a total of 7 kg (15.4 lb) of uranium and thorium at  any one time. A person authorized to possess, use, and transfer source  material under this paragraph may not receive more than a total of 70 kg  (154 lb) of uranium and thorium in any one calendar year. A person may  not alter the chemical or physical form of the source material possessed  under this paragraph unless it is accounted for under the limits of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No more than 7 kg (15.4 lb) of uranium, removed during the  treatment of drinking water, at any one time. A person may not remove  more than 70 kg (154 lb) of uranium from drinking water during a  calendar year under this paragraph; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No more than 7 kg (15.4 lb) of uranium and thorium at  laboratories for the purpose of determining the concentration of uranium  and thorium contained within the material being analyzed at any one  time. A person authorized to possess, use, and transfer source material  under this paragraph may not receive more than a total of 70 kg (154 lb)  of source material in any one calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person who receives, possesses, uses, or transfers source  material in accordance with the general license in paragraph (a) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is prohibited from administering source material, or the  radiation therefrom, either externally or internally, to human beings  except as may be authorized by the NRC in a specific license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shall not abandon such source material. Source material may be  disposed of as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A cumulative total of 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) of source material in a  solid, non-dispersible form may be transferred each calendar year, by a  person authorized to receive, possess, use, and transfer source material  under this general license to persons receiving the material for  permanent disposal. The recipient of source material transferred under  the provisions of this paragraph is exempt from the requirements to  obtain a license under this part to the extent the source material is  permanently disposed. This provision does not apply to any person who is  in possession of source material under a specific license issued under  this chapter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In accordance with Sec. 20.2001 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is subject to the provisions in Sec.

When activities involving such source material are  permanently ceased at any site, if evidence of significant contamination  is identified, the general licensee shall notify the Director of the  Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards by an appropriate  method listed in Sec. 40.5(a) about such contamination and may consult  with the NRC as to the appropriateness of sampling and restoration  activities to ensure that any contamination or residual source material  remaining at the site where source material was used under this general  license is not likely to result in exposures that exceed the limits in  Sec. 20.1402 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person who receives, possesses, uses, or transfers source  material in accordance with the general license granted in paragraph (a)  of this section is exempt from the provisions of parts 19, 20, and 21 of  this chapter to the extent that such receipt, possession, use, and  transfer are within the terms of this general license, except that such  person shall comply with the provisions of Sec.
