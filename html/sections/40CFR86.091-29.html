The  Administrator may specify that he will conduct such testing at the  manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment  specified by the Administrator shall be made available by the  manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a  manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall be scheduled by  the manufacturer as promptly as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine  the results of that test, unless subsequently invalidated by the  Administrator, shall comprise the official data for the engine at that  prescribed test point and the manufacturer's data for that prescribed  test point shall not be used in determining compliance with emission  standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever the Administrator does not conduct a test on a test  engine at a test point, the manufacturer's test data will be accepted as  the official data for that test point: Provided, That if the  Administrator makes a determination based on testing under paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, that there is a lack of correlation between the  manufacturer's test equipment and the test equipment used by the  Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes  of certification until the reasons for the lack of correlation are  determined and the validity of the data is established by the  manufacturer, And further provided, That if the Administrator has  reasonable basis to believe that any test data submitted by the  manufacturer is not accurate or has been obtained in violation of any  provision of this part, the Administrator may refuse to accept that data  as the official data pending retesting or submission of further  information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)</em> The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any  adjustable parameter of an emission-data engine which the Administrator  has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in  accordance   with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1), to any setting within the physically  adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator  in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i), prior to the performance of  any tests to determine whether such engine conforms to applicable  emission standards, including tests performed by the manufacturer under  Sec. 86.088-23(c)(2). The Administrator, in making or specifying such  adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the  manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance  characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will  occur on in-use heavy-duty engines. In determining likelihood, the  Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the  effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and  surveillance information from similar in-use engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For those engine parameters which the Administrator has not  determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in  accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(1), the emission-data engine presented  to the Administrator for testing shall be calibrated within the  production tolerances applicable to the manufacturer's specifications to  be shown on the engine label (see Sec. 86.091-35(a)(3)(iii)) as  specified in the application for certification. If the Administrator  determines that an engine is not within such tolerances, the engine  shall be adjusted at the facility designated by the Administrator prior  to the test and an engineering report shall be submitted to the  Administrator describing the corrective action taken. Based on the  engineering report, the Administrator will determine if the engine shall  be used as an emission-data engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the Administrator determines that the test data developed  under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section would cause the emission- data engine to fail due to excessive 125-hour emission values or by the  application of the appropriate deterioration factor, then the following  procedure shall be observed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> may be readjusted to the manufacturer's  specifications, if these adjustments were made incorrectly prior to the  first test. The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any  parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to  adjustment in accordance with Sec. 86.085-22(e)(3)(i). However, if the  idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be  subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a  setting which causes a higher engine idle speed than would have been  possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed  parameter on the engine before it accumulated any dynamometer service,  all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the  comparison. Other maintenance or repairs may be performed in accordance  with Sec. 86.088-25. All work on the vehicle shall be done at such  location and under such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The engine will be retested by the Administrator and the results  of this test shall comprise the official data for the emission-data  engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If sufficient durability data are not available at the time of  any emission test conducted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to  enable the Administrator to determine whether an emission-data engine  would fail, the manufacturer may request a retest in accordance with the  provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) (1) and (2) of this section. If  the manufacturer does not promptly make such request, he shall be deemed  to have waived the right to a retest. A request for retest must be made  before the manufacturer removes the engine from the test premises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Paragraph (c) of this section applies to gasoline-fueled and  methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may require that any one or more of the  evaporative emission family-system combinations included in the  manufacturer's statement(s) of compliance be installed on an appropriate  vehicle and such vehicle be submitted to him, at such place or places as  he may designate, for the purpose of conducting emissions tests. The  Administrator   may specify that he will conduct such testing at the manufacturer's  facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment specified by the  Administrator shall be made available by the manufacturer for test  operations. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility pursuant  to this paragraph shall be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as  possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever the Administrator conducts a test segment on an  evaporative emission family-system combination, the results of that test  segment, unless subsequently invalidated by the Administrator, shall  comprise the official data for that test segment for the evaporative  emission family-system combination, and the manufacturer's data,  analyses, etc., for that test segment shall not be used in determining  compliance with emission standards. The Administrator may stop a test  after any evaporative test segment and use as official data any valid  results obtained up to that point in the test, as described in subpart B  of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever the Administrator does not conduct a test on an  evaporative emission family-system combination, the manufacturer's test  data will be accepted as the official data: Provided, That if the  Administrator makes a determination, based on testing under paragraph  (c)(2) of this section, that there is a lack of correlation between the  manufacturer's test equipment and the test equipment used by the  Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will be accepted for purposes  of certification until the reasons for the lack of correlation are  determined and the validity of the data is established by the  manufacturer, And further provided, That if the Administrator has  reasonable basis to believe that any test data, analyses, or other  information submitted by the manufacturer is not accurate or has been  obtained in violation of any provision of this part, the Administrator  may refuse to accept those data, analyses, etc., as the official data  pending retesting or submission of further information.
