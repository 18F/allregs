                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ordering loan checks. Checks will not be ordered until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440- 57, ``Acknowledgement of Obligated Funds/Check Request,'' has been  received from the Finance Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant has complied with approval conditions and any  closing instructions, except for those actions which are to be completed  on the date of loan closing or subsequent thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The applicant is ready to start construction or funds are needed  to pay interim financing obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public bodies and Indian tribes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After loan approval the  completed docket will be reviewed by the State Director. The information  required by OGC will be transmitted to OGC with a request for closing  instructions. Upon receipt of the closing instructions from OGC, the  State Director will forward them along with any appropriate instructions  to the District Director. Upon receipt of closing instructions, the  District Director will discuss with the applicant and its architect or  engineer, attorney, and other appropriate representatives, the  requirements contained therein and any actions necessary to proceed with  closing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loans will be closed in accordance with the closing instructions  issued by OGC and Sec. 1942.19 of subpart A of this part 1942.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Organizations other than public bodies and Indian tribes.  District Directors are authorized to close loans to organizations other  than public bodies and Indian tribes without closing instructions from  OGC. State Directors, in consultation with OGC, should develop standard  closing procedures and forms as needed. Assistance with loan closing and  a certification regarding the validity of the note and mortgage or other  debt instruments should be provided by the applicant's attorney.  Appropriate title opinion or title insurance is required as provided in  Sec. 1942.17 (j)(4)(i)(B) of subpart A of this part 1942.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authority to execute, file, and record legal instruments.  District Office employees are authorized to execute and file or record  any legal instruments necessary to obtain or preserve security for  loans.

Unless otherwise required by State law or unless an  exception is approved by the State Director with advice of the OGC, only  one mortgage will be taken even though the indebtedness is to be  evidenced by more than one instrument. The real estate or chattel  mortgages or security instruments will be delivered to the recording  office for recordation or filing, as appropriate. A copy of such  instruments will be delivered to the borrower. The original instrument,  if returnable after recording or filing, will be retained in the  borrower's case folder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notes and bonds. When the debt instrument is a note or single  instrument bond fully registered as to principal and interest a  conformed copy will be sent to the Finance Office immediately after loan  closing and the original instrument will be stored in the District  Office. When other types of bonds are used, the original bond(s) will be  forwarded to the Finance Office immediately after loan closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of title evidence. All title evidence other than the  opinion of title and mortgage title insurance policy, will be returned  to the borrower when the loan has been closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Multiple advances. When temporary paper, such as bond  anticipation notes or interim receipts, is used to conform with the  multiple advance requirement, the original temporary paper will be  forwarded to the Finance Office after each advance is made to the  borrower. The borrower's case number will be entered in the upper right- hand corner of such paper by the Distict Office. The permanent debt  instrument(s) should be forwarded to the Finance Office as soon as  possible after the last advance is made, except that   for notes and single instrument bonds fully registered as to principal  and interest the original will be retained in the District Office and a  copy will be forwarded to the Finance Office. The following actions will  be taken prior to issuance of the permanent instruments:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Finance Office will be notified of the anticipated date for  the retirement of the interim instruments and the issuance of permanent  instruments of debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer will prepare a  statement of account including accrued interest through the proposed  date of retirement and also show the daily interest accrual. The  statement of account and the interim financing instruments will be  forwarded to the Rural Development Manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Rural Development Manager will collect interest through the  actual date of the retirement and obtain the permanent instrument(s) of  debt in exchange for the interim financing instruments. The permanent  instruments and the cash collection will be forwarded to the Office of  the Deputy Chief Financial Officer immediately, except that for notes  and single instrument bonds fully registered as to principal and  interest the original will be retained in the Area Office and a copy  will be forwarded to the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer.  In developing the permanent instruments, the sequence of preference set  out Sec. 1942.19(e) of Subpart A of Part 1942 of this chapter will be  followed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bond registration record. Form FmHA or its successor agency  under Public Law 103-354 442-28, ``Bond Registration Book,'' may be used  as a guide to assist borrowers in the preparation of a bond registration  book in those cases where a registration book is required and a book is  not provided in connection with the printing of the bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Loan disbursements. Whenever a loan disbursement is received,  lost, or destroyed, the Rural Development Manager will take the  appropriate actions outlined in Rural Development Instruction 2018-D.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Safeguarding bond shipments.

When the loan has been closed, the Rural  Development Manager will submit the completed loan closing documents and  a statement showing what was done in closing the loan to the State  Director. The State Director will review the documents and the Rural  Development Manager's statement to determine whether the transaction was  closed properly. For loans to public bodies or Indian tribes the State  Director will forward all documents, along with a statement that all  administrative requirements have been met, to the Regional Attorney. The  Regional Attorney will review the submitted material to determine  whether all legal requirements have been met. The Regional Attorney  should review Rural Development standard forms only for proper  execution, unless the State Director brings attention to specific  questions. Facility development should not be held up pending receipt of  the Regional Attorney opinion. When the review of the State Director has  been completed, and for public bodies and Indian tribes the Regional  Attorney's opinion has been received, the State Director must advise the  Rural Development Manager of any deficiencies that must be corrected and  return all material that was submitted for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Loan cancellation.
