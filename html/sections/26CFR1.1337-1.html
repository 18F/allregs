                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939 an allowable deduction for the taxable year which did not  result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In the case of recoveries of war  losses and other items to which the recovery exclusion provisions of  section 111 apply, such as bad debts, the determination of the tax  benefit should be made in accordance with section 111(b) and the  regulations thereunder. The deductions allowed a taxpayer for any  taxable year on account of war losses are all the deductions on account  of war losses which were claimed by the taxpayer in a return, in a claim  for credit or refund of an overpayment, or in a petition to The Tax  Court of the United States with respect to such taxable year and which  were not disallowed, and all deductions on account of war losses which,  although not so claimed by the taxpayer, were nevertheless allowed (for  example, by the Commissioner, a court, or The Tax Court) in computing a  tax of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any deduction allowable for a taxable year on account of a war  loss under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which was  not claimed by the taxpayer for such year in a return, a claim for  credit or refund of an overpayment, or a petition to the Tax Court of  the United States and was not allowed as a deduction (for example, by  the Commissioner, a court, or the Tax Court) in computing his tax for  such year or for any other year is considered a deduction which did not  result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, since it is an allowable deduction  which was not allowed in computing any tax of the taxpayer. If the  taxpayer claimed for any taxable year a deduction on account of a war  loss, and if such deduction was disallowed, the taxpayer may not  subsequently contend for the purposes of section 1331 that such  deduction was an allowable deduction for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the taxpayer elected under section 127(b) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939 to decrease the amount of a war loss by treating  the obligations and liabilities described in that section as discharged  or satisfied out of the property destroyed or seized, and if the  taxpayer establishes that any of the obligations and liabilities were  not so discharged or satisfied, then the amount by which such continuing  obligations and liabilities decreased the war loss shall be considered  an allowable deduction for the taxable year in which the war loss was  sustained which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer  under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
