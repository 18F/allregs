Whenever an SAA has information indicating the possible existence of a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard in a manufactured home, the SAA may initiate administrative review of the need for notification and correction. An SAA initiates administrative review by either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Referring the matter to another SAA in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or to the Secretary; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taking action itself, in accordance with Sec. 3282.412, when it appears that all of the homes affected by the noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard were manufactured in the SAA's State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SAA referral of matter. If at any time it appears that the affected manufactured homes were manufactured in more than one State, an SAA that decides to initiate such administrative review must refer the matter to the Secretary for possible action pursuant to Sec. 3282.412. If it appears that all of the affected manufactured homes were manufactured in another State, an SAA that decides to initiate administrative review must refer the matter to the SAA in the State of manufacture or to the Secretary, for possible action pursuant to Sec. 3282.412.</p>
