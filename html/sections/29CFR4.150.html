                            <p class="depth0">The Act, in section 2(b), makes it clear that its provisions apply  generally to all service employees engaged in performing work on a  covered contract entered into by the contractor with the Federal  Government, regardless of whether they are the contractor's employees or  those of any subcontractor under such contract. All service employees  who, on or after the date of award, are engaged in working on or in  connection with the contract, either in performing the specific services  called for by its terms or in performing other duties necessary to the  performance of the contract, are thus subject to the Act unless a  specific exemption (see Sec. Sec. 4.115 et seq.) is applicable. All  such employees must be paid wages at a rate not less than the minimum  wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29  U.S.C. 206(a)(1)), as amended. Payment of a higher minimum monetary wage  and the furnishing of fringe benefits may be required under the  contract, pursuant to the provisions of sections 2 (a)(1), (2), and 4(c)  of the Act.</p>
