                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NHTSA may issue a subpoena to compel any person, sole  proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other entity to provide  information at an information gathering hearing. The subpoenas are used  for the purpose of obtaining testimony from a witness under oath and  obtaining relevant documents and things. The Administrator, or a NHTSA  employee designated by the Administrator, presides at the hearing.  Information gathering hearings are open to the public unless the  presiding officer rules otherwise, and the hearings are stenographically  reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the presiding officer, one or more other persons  may comprise the panel. Each member of the panel may question any  witness at the hearing. No person who is not a member of the panel may  ask questions of a witness. However, any person may submit to the panel,  in writing, proposed questions to be asked of a witness. A member of the  panel may pose these questions to the witness if that member deems the  questions useful and appropriate. Proposed questions may be submitted to  the panel at any time before or during the course of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The stenographic record of each witness's testimony will be  available to the public, unless the testimony was not given publicly and  the witness requests confidential treatment for some or all of his or  her testimony. When an oral request for confidential treatment is made  during the course of a witness's testimony, the presiding officer may  order the hearing closed to the public at that point and continue the  questioning of the witness, or may note the request for confidentiality  and direct the witness not to answer the question at that time, but  require the witness to answer the question in writing within some  specified period, or take such other action as the presiding officer  deems appropriate. If a request for confidential treatment is made, the  release of the record is governed by the applicable laws or regulations  relating to the handling of allegedly confidential information. To the  extent that some or all of a witness's testimony is not publicly  available, that witness may procure a copy of his or her testimony as  recorded upon payment of lawfully prescribed costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person who is required by subpoena or designated by an  entity that is required by subpoena to provide information at an  information gathering hearing conducted under this section may be  accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Any member of the bar  of a Federal court or the courts of any State or Territory of the United  States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia,  and any representative, official, or employee of the sole  proprietorship, partnership, corporation or other entity under subpoena  may act as counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A witness appearing in response to subpoena may confer in  confidence with his or her counsel or representative concerning any  questions asked of the witness. If such witness, counsel, or  representative objects to a question, he or she shall state the  objection and basis therefor on the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The presiding officer at an information gathering hearing takes  all necessary action to regulate the course of the hearing, to avoid  delay, and to assure that reasonable standards of orderly and ethical  conduct are maintained. In any case in which counsel for or a  representative of a witness has refused to comply with the presiding  officer's directions, or to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly  and ethical conduct in the course of a hearing, the presiding officer  states on the record the reasons given, if any, for the refusal and, if  the presiding officer is someone other than the Administrator,  immediately reports the refusal to the Administrator. The Administrator  thereupon takes such action as the circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where appropriate, the procedures established in this subsection  may be utilized in informal hearings conducted by NHTSA pursuant to its  authority under sections 152 and 156 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1412,  1416) to receive   data, views and arguments concerning alleged safety-related defects. The  rights accorded to witnesses in this subsection may also be accorded to  witnesses who appear voluntarily at such hearings.</p>
