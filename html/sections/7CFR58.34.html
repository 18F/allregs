Within 10 days after receipt of the aforesaid notice and statement of reasons by such individual, he may file an appeal in writing with the Administrator supported by any argument or evidence that he may wish to offer as to why his license should not be suspended or revoked. In conjunction therewith, he may request and, in such event, shall be accorded an oral hearing. After consideration of such argument and evidence, the Administrator will take such action as warranted with respect to such suspension or revocation. When no appeal is filed within the prescribed 10 days, the license is revoked.</p>
