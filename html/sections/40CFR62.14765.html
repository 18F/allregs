                                Sec. 62.14765  What is an air curtain incinerator?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An air curtain incinerator operates by forcefully projecting a  curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion  occurs. Incinerators of this type can be constructed above or below  ground and with or without refractory walls and floor. (Air curtain  incinerators are different from conventional combustion devices which  typically have enclosed fireboxes and controlled air technology such as  mass   burn, modular, and fluidized bed combustors.)</p>
