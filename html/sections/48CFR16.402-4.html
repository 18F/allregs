                            <p class="depth0">A properly structured multiple-incentive arrangement should--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Motivate the contractor to strive for outstanding results in all incentive areas; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compel trade-off decisions among the incentive areas, consistent with

the Government's overall objectives for the acquisition. Because of the interdependency of the Government's cost, the technical performance, and the delivery goals, a contract that emphasizes only one of the goals may jeopardize control over the others. Because outstanding results may not be attainable for each of the incentive areas, all multiple-incentive contracts must include a cost incentive (or constraint) that operates to preclude rewarding a contractor for superior technical performance or delivery results when the cost of those results outweighs their value to the Government.</p>
