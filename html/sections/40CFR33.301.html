                            <p class="depth0">A recipient, including one exempted from applying the fair share objective requirements by Sec. 33.411, is required to make the following good faith efforts whenever procuring construction, equipment, services and supplies under an EPA financial assistance agreement, even if it has achieved its fair share objectives under subpart D of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ensure DBEs are made aware of contracting opportunities to the fullest extent practicable through outreach and recruitment activities. For Indian Tribal, State and Local and Government recipients, this will include placing DBEs on solicitation lists and soliciting them whenever they are potential sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Make information on forthcoming opportunities available to DBEs and arrange time frames for contracts and establish delivery schedules, where the requirements permit, in a way that encourages and facilitates participation by DBEs in the competitive process. This includes, whenever possible, posting solicitations for bids or proposals for a minimum of 30 calendar days before the bid or proposal closing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consider in the contracting process whether firms competing for large contracts could subcontract with DBEs. For Indian Tribal, State and local Government recipients, this will include dividing total requirements when economically feasible into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by DBEs in the competitive process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Encourage contracting with a consortium of DBEs when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use the services and assistance of the SBA and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the prime contractor awards subcontracts, require the prime contractor to take the steps in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p>
