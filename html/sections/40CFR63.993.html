(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the TRE index value is between the level specified in a referencing subpart and 4.0, either an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record or a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device, each capable of providing a continuous record, shall be used. If the difference between the specific gravity of the saturated scrubbing fluid and specific gravity of the fresh scrubbing fluid is less than 0.02 specific gravity units, an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record shall be used. Monitoring results shall be recorded as specified in Sec.  63.998(b) and (c), as applicable. General requirements for monitoring and continuous parameter monitoring systems are contained in Sec.  63.996.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and the TRE index value is between the level specified in a referencing subpart and 4.0, either an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record or a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device, each capable of providing a continuous record, shall be used.
