                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The right to appear and present evidence. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enrollee has  the right to appear at the hearing before the ALJ to present evidence  and to state his or her position. An enrollee may appear by video- teleconferencing, telephone, or in person as determined under  Sec. 423.2020.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An enrollee may also make his or her appearance by means of a  representative, who may make his or her appearance by video- teleconferencing, telephone, or in person, as determined under  Sec. 423.2020.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Witness testimony may be given and CMS, IRE, and Part D plan  sponsor participation may also be accomplished by video- teleconferencing, telephone, or in person, as determined under  Sec. 423.2020.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver of the right to appear. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An enrollee may send the ALJ  a written statement indicating that he or she does not wish to appear at  the hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For expedited hearings, an enrollee may indicate in writing or  orally that he or she does not wish to appear at the hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ALJ hearing office must document all oral waivers in  writing and maintain the documentation in the case files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The enrollee may subsequently withdraw his or her waiver in  writing at any time before the notice of the hearing decision is issued;  however, by withdrawing the waiver the enrollee agrees to an extension  of the adjudication period as specified in Sec. 423.2016, that may be  necessary to schedule and hold the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Even if the enrollee waives his or her right to appear at a  hearing, the ALJ may require him or her to attend an oral hearing if the  ALJ believes that a personal appearance and testimony by the enrollee is  necessary to decide the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Presenting written statements and oral arguments. An enrollee or  an enrollee's appointed representative, as defined at Sec. 423.560, may  appear before the ALJ to state the enrollee's case, to present a written  summary of the case, or to enter written statements about the facts and  law material to the case in the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver of adjudication period. At any time during the hearing  process, the enrollee may waive the adjudication deadline specified in  Sec. 423.2016 for issuing a hearing decision. The waiver may be for a  specific period of time agreed upon by the ALJ and the enrollee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What evidence is admissible at a hearing. The ALJ may receive  evidence at the hearing even though the evidence is not admissible in  court under the rules of evidence used by the court. However, the ALJ  may not consider evidence on any change in condition of an enrollee  after a coverage determination. If the enrollee wishes for the evidence  to be considered, the ALJ must remand the case to the Part D IRE as set  forth in Sec. 423.2034(b)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subpoenas. When it is reasonably necessary for the full  presentation of a case, an ALJ may, on his or her own initiative, issue  subpoenas for the appearance and testimony of witnesses and for the  enrollee and/or the Part D plan sponsor to make books, records,  correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to an issue  at the hearing available for inspection and copying. An ALJ may not  issue a subpoena to CMS, or the IRE to compel an appearance, testimony,  or the production of evidence, or to the Part D plan sponsor to compel  an appearance or testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reviewability of an ALJ Subpoena. A subpoena issued by an ALJ is  not subject to immediate review by the MAC. The subpoena may be reviewed  solely during the MAC's review specified in Sec. 423.2102 and  Sec. 423.2110.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception. To the extent a subpoena compels disclosure of a  matter which an objection based on privilege, or other protection from  disclosure such as case preparation, confidentiality, or undue burden,  was made before an ALJ, the MAC may review immediately the ruling of the  ALJ on the objections to the subpoena or that portion of the subpoena as  applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon notice to the ALJ that the enrollee or a non-party, as  applicable, intends to seek MAC review of the ALJ's ruling on the  subpoena, the ALJ must stay all proceedings affected by the subpoena.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The proceedings are stayed for 15 calendar days or until the  MAC issues a written decision that affirms, reverses, or modifies the  ALJ's subpoena, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the MAC does not take action within the 15 calendar days,  then the stay is lifted and the enrollee or non-party must comply with  the ALJ's subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Enforcement. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the ALJ determines that an enrollee or  person other than the enrollee subject to a subpoena issued under this  section has refused to comply with the subpoena, the ALJ may request  that the Secretary seek enforcement of the subpoena in accordance with  section 205(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 405(e).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After submitting the enforcement request, the time period for  the ALJ to issue a decision, dismissal or remand a   case in response to a request for hearing is stayed for 15 calendar days  or until the Secretary makes a decision with respect to the enforcement  request, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any enforcement request by an ALJ must consist of a written  notice to the Secretary describing in detail the ALJ's findings of  noncompliance and his or her specific request for enforcement, and  providing a copy of the subpoena and evidence of its receipt by  certified mail by the enrollee or person other than the enrollee subject  to the subpoena.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The ALJ must promptly mail a copy of the notice and related  documents to the individual or entity subject to the subpoena, to the  enrollee, and to any other affected person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Witnesses at a hearing. Witnesses may appear at a hearing. They  testify under oath or affirmation, unless the ALJ finds an important  reason to excuse them from taking an oath or affirmation. The ALJ may  ask the witnesses any questions relevant to the issues and allow the  enrollee or his or her appointed representative, as defined at  Sec. 423.560.</p>
