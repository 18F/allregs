In case of  failure to file a return required under authority of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subchapter A, chapter 61 of the Code, relating to returns and  records (other than sections 6015 and 6016, relating to declarations of  estimated tax, and part III thereof, relating to information returns);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subchapter A, chapter 51 of the Code, relating to distilled  spirits, wines, and beer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Subchapter A, chapter 52 of the Code, relating to cigars,  cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Subchapter A, chapter 53 of the Code, relating to machine guns,  destructive devices, and certain other firearms; and  The regulations thereunder, on or before the date prescribed for filing  (determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing), there  shall be added to the tax required to be shown on the return the amount  specified below unless the failure to file the return within the  prescribed time is shown to the satisfaction of the district director or  the director of the service center to be due to reasonable cause and not  to willful neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 5 percent  thereof if the failure is for not more than 1 month, with an additional  5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the  failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate. The  amount of any addition under this subparagraph shall be reduced by the  amount of the addition under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for any  month to which an addition to tax applies under both subparagraphs (1)  and (2) of this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay  the amount shown as tax on any return (required to be filed after  December 31, 1969, without regard to any extension of time for filing  thereof) specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), on or  before the date prescribed for payment of such tax (determined with  regard to any extension of time for payment), there shall be added to  the tax shown on the return the amount specified below unless the  failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the  satisfaction of the district director, or, as provided in paragraph (a)  of this section, the Assistant Regional Commissioner (Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms), the director of the service center, to be due to  reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. Except as provided in  paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the amount to be added to the tax is  0.5 percent of the amount of tax shown on the return if the failure is  for not more than 1 month, with an additional 0.5 percent for each  additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues,  but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, see  Sec. 301.6601-1(f)(5) for   the definition of calendar day and business day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reduction of failure to pay penalty during the period an  installment agreement is in effect--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of a  return filed by an individual on or before the due date for the return  (including extensions)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount added to tax for a month or fraction thereof is  determined by using 0.25 percent instead of 0.5 percent under paragraph  (a)(2) of this section if at any time during the month an installment  agreement under section 6159 is in effect for the payment of such tax;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount added to tax for a month or fraction thereof is  determined by using 0.25 percent instead of 0.5 percent under paragraph  (a)(3) of this section if at any time during the month an installment  agreement under section 6159 is in effect for the payment of such tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (a)(4) applies for purposes of  determining additions to tax for months beginning after December 31,  1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Month defined. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the date prescribed for filing the return  or paying tax is the last day of a calendar month, each succeeding  calendar month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or  pay tax continues shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax is a  date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period which  terminates with the date numerically corresponding thereto in the  succeeding calendar month and each such successive period shall  constitute a month for purposes of section 6651. If, in the month of  February, there is no date corresponding to the date prescribed for  filing the return or paying tax, the period from such date in January  through the last day of February shall constitute a month for purposes  of section 6651. Thus, if a return is due on January 30, the first month  shall end on February 28 (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding  months shall end on March 30, April 30, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a return is not timely filed or tax is not timely paid, the  fact that the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax, or  the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a  Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday is immaterial in determining the  number of months for which the addition to the tax under section 6651  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Showing of reasonable cause. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer who wishes  to avoid the addition to the tax for failure to file a tax return or pay  tax must make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as a  reasonable cause for his failure to file such return or pay such tax on  time in the form of a written statement containing a declaration that it  is made under penalties of perjury. Such statement should be filed with  the district director or the director of the service center with whom  the return is required to be filed; Provided, That where special tax  returns of liquor dealers are delivered to an alcohol, tobacco and  firearms officer working under the supervision of the Regional Director,  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, such statement may be delivered  with the return. If the district director, the director of the service  center, or, where applicable, the Regional Director, Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms, determines that the delinquency was due to a  reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the addition to the tax  will not be assessed. If the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care  and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the  prescribed time, then the delay is due to a reasonable cause. A failure  to pay will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent  that the taxpayer has made a satisfactory showing that he exercised  ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of his tax  liability and was nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would  suffer an undue hardship (as described in Sec. 1.6161-1(b) of this  chapter) if he paid on the due date. In determining whether the taxpayer  was unable to pay the tax in spite of the exercise of ordinary business  care and prudence in providing for payment of his tax liability,  consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances of the  taxpayer's financial situation, including   the amount and nature of the taxpayer's expenditures in light of the  income (or other amounts) he could, at the time of such expenditures,  reasonably expect to receive prior to the date prescribed for the  payment of the tax. Thus, for example, a taxpayer who incurs lavish or  extravagant living expenses in an amount such that the remainder of his  assets and anticipated income will be insufficient to pay his tax, has  not exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the  payment of his tax liability. Further, a taxpayer who invests funds in  speculative or illiquid assets has not exercised ordinary business care  and prudence in providing for the payment of his tax liability unless,  at the time of the investment, the remainder of the taxpayer's assets  and estimated income will be sufficient to pay his tax or it can be  reasonably foreseen that the speculative or illiquid investment made by  the taxpayer can be utilized (by sale or as security for a loan) to  realize sufficient funds to satisfy the tax liability. A taxpayer will  be considered to have exercised ordinary business care and prudence if  he made reasonable efforts to conserve sufficient assets in marketable  form to satisfy his tax liability and nevertheless was unable to pay all  or a portion of the tax when it became due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In determining if the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care  and prudence in providing for the payment of his tax liability,  consideration will be given to the nature of the tax which the taxpayer  has failed to pay. Thus, for example, facts and circumstances which,  because of the taxpayer's efforts to conserve assets in marketable form,  may constitute reasonable cause for nonpayment of income taxes may not  constitute reasonable cause for failure to pay over taxes described in  section 7501 that are collected or withheld from any other person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If, for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1995, an  individual taxpayer satisfies the requirement of Sec. 1.6081-4(a) of  this chapter (relating to automatic extension of time for filing an  individual income tax return), reasonable cause will be presumed, for  the period of the extension of time to file, with respect to any  underpayment of tax if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The excess of the amount of tax shown on the individual income  tax return over the amount of tax paid on or before the regular due date  of the return (by virtue of tax withheld by the employer, estimated tax  payments, and any payment with an application for extension of time to  file pursuant to Sec. 1.6081-4 of this chapter) is no greater than 10  percent of the amount of tax shown on the individual income tax return;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any balance due shown on the individual income tax return is  remitted with the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If, for a taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1972, a  corporate taxpayer satisfies the requirements of Sec. 1.6081-3 (a)  (relating to an automatic extension of time for filing a corporation  income tax return), reasonable cause shall be presumed, for the period  of the extension of time to file, with respect to any underpayment of  tax if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of tax (determined without regard to any prepayment  thereof) shown on Form 7004, or the amount of tax paid on or before the  regular due date of the return, is at least 90 percent of the amount of  tax shown on the taxpayer's Form 1120, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any balance due shown on the Form 1120 is paid on, or before  the due date of the return, including any extensions of time for filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Penalty imposed on net amount due--(1) Credits against the tax.  The amount of tax required to be shown on the return for purposes of  section 6651(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and the amount shown as tax on the return for  purposes of section 6651(a)(2) shall be reduced by the amount of any  part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which  may be claimed on the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partial payments. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of tax required to be shown on  the return for purposes of section 6651(a)(2) shall, for the purpose of  computing the addition for any month, be reduced by the amount of any  part of the tax which is paid after the date prescribed for payment and  on or before the first day of such month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of tax stated in the notice and demand for purposes  of section 6651(a)(3) shall, for the purpose of computing the addition  for any month, be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is  paid before the first day of such month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No addition to tax if fraud penalty assessed. No addition to the  tax under section 6651 shall be assessed with respect to an underpayment  of tax if a 50-percent addition to the tax for fraud is assessed with  respect to the same underpayment under section 6653(b). See section  6653(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples.
