To prove a child's dependency, an applicant may be asked to show that at a specific time the child lived with the employee, that the child received contributions for his or her support from the employee, or that the employee provided at least one-half of the child's support. The terms ``living with'', ``contributing to support'', and ``one-half support'' are defined in Sec. Sec. 222.58, 222.42, an 222.43.
