                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of the Veterans Choice Program under Sec. Sec.  17.1500  through 17.1540:</p><p class="depth0">Appointment means an authorized and scheduled encounter with a  health care provider for the delivery of hospital care or medical  services. A visit to an emergency room or an unscheduled visit to a  clinic is not an appointment.</p><p class="depth0">Attempt to schedule means contact with a VA scheduler or VA health  care provider in which a stated request by the veteran for an  appointment is made.</p><p class="depth0">Episode of care means a necessary course of treatment, including  follow-up appointments and ancillary and specialty services, which lasts  no longer than 60 days from the date of the first appointment with a  non-VA health care provider.</p><p class="depth0">Health-care plan means an insurance policy or contract, medical or  hospital service agreement, membership or subscription contract, or  similar arrangement not administered by the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs, under which health services for individuals are provided or the  expenses of such services are paid; and does not include any such  policy, contract, agreement, or similar arrangement pursuant to title  XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) or  chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code.</p><p class="depth0">Residence means a legal residence or personal domicile, even if such  residence is seasonal. A person may maintain more than one residence but  may only have one residence at a time. If a veteran lives in more than  one location during a year, the veteran's residence is the residence or  domicile where the person is staying at the time the veteran wants to  receive hospital care or medical services through the Program. A post  office box or other non-residential point of delivery does not  constitute a residence.</p><p class="depth0">Schedule means identifying and confirming a date, time, location,  and entity or health care provider for an appointment.</p><p class="depth0">VA medical facility means a VA hospital, a VA community-based  outpatient clinic, or a VA health care center. A Vet Center, or  Readjustment Counseling Service Center, is not a VA medical facility.</p><p class="depth0">Wait-time goals of the Veterans Health Administration means, unless  changed by further notice in the Federal Register, a date not more than  30 days from either:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The date that an appointment is deemed clinically appropriate by  a VA   health care provider. In the event a VA health care provider identifies  a time range when care must be provided (e.g., within the next 2  months), VA will use the last clinically appropriate date for  determining whether or not such care is timely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Or, if no such clinical determination has been made, the date  that a veteran prefers to be seen for hospital care or medical services.  (Authority: Sec. 101, Pub. L. 113-146, 128 Stat. 1754)</p>
