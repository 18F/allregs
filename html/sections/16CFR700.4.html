                                Sec. 700.4  Parties ``actually making'' a written warranty.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Section 110(f) of the Act provides that only the supplier ``actually  making'' a written warranty is liable for purposes of FTC and private  enforcement of the Act. A supplier who does no more than distribute or  sell a consumer product covered by a written warranty offered by another  person or business and which identifies that person or business as the  warrantor is not liable for failure of the written warranty to comply  with the Act or rules thereunder. However, other actions and written and  oral representations of such a supplier in connection with the offer or  sale of a warranted product may obligate that supplier under the Act. If  under State law the supplier is deemed to have ``adopted'' the written  affirmation of fact, promise, or undertaking, the supplier is also  obligated under the Act. Suppliers are advised to consult State law to  determine those actions and representations which may   make them co-warrantors, and therefore obligated under the warranty of  the other person or business.</p>
