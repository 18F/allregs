                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to Sec. 1902.20(b)(1)(iii) and Sec. 1954.3 of this chapter  under which an agreement has been entered into with Puerto Rico,  effective December 8, 1981, and based on a determination that Puerto  Rico is operational in the issues covered by the Puerto Rico  occupational safety and health plan, discretionary Federal enforcement  authority under section 18(e) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 667(e)) will not be  initiated with regard to Federal occupational safety and health  standards in issues covered under 29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926 except as  provided in this section. The U.S. Department of Labor will continue to  exercise authority, among other things, with regard to: complaints filed  with the U.S. Department of Labor alleging discrimination under section  11(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 660(c)); safety and health in private sector  maritime activities and will continue to enforce   all provisions of the Act, rules of orders, and all Federal standards,  current or future, specifically directed to maritime employment (29 CFR  Part 1915, shipyard employment; Part 1917, marine terminals; Part 1918,  longshoring; Part 1919, gear certification) as well as provisions of  general industry and construction standards (29 CFR Parts 1910 and 1926)  appropriate to hazards found in these employments; enforcement relating  to any contractors or subcontractors on any Federal establishment where  the State cannot obtain entry; enforcement of new Federal standards  until the State adopts a comparable standard; situations where the State  is refused entry and is unable to obtain a warrant or enforce the right  of entry; enforcement of unique and complex standards as determined by  the Assistant Secretary; situations when the State is temporarily unable  to exercise its enforcement authority fully or effectively; completion  of enforcement actions initiated prior to the effective date of the  agreement; and investigations and inspections for the purpose of the  evaluation of the Puerto Rico plan under sections 18(e) and (f) of the  Act (29 U.S.C. 667(e) and (f)). Federal OSHA will also retain authority  for coverage of Federal employers and employees, and the U.S. Postal  Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and  contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations. The OSHA  Regional Administrator will make a prompt recommendation for the  resumption of the exercise of Federal enforcement authority under  section 18(e) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 667(e)) whenever, and to the degree,  necessary to assure occupational safety and health protection to  employees in Puerto Rico.
