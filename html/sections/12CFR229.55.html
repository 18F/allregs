                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Circumstances giving rise to a claim. A bank that has an  indemnity claim under Sec. 229.53 with respect to a substitute check may  make an expedited recredit claim against an indemnifying bank if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant bank or a bank that the claimant bank has  indemnified--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has received a claim for expedited recredit from a consumer  under Sec. 229.54; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Would have been subject to such a claim if the consumer account  had been charged for the substitute check;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claimant bank is obligated to provide an expedited recredit  with respect to such substitute check under   Sec. 229.54 or otherwise has suffered a resulting loss; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The production of the original check or a sufficient copy is  necessary to determine the validity of the charge to the consumer  account or the validity of any warranty claim connected with such  substitute check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for making claims. A claimant bank shall send its  claim to the indemnifying bank, subject to the timing, content, and form  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Timing of claim. The claimant bank shall submit its claim such  that the indemnifying bank receives the claim by the end of the 120th  calendar day after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the  claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content of claim. The claimant bank's claim shall include the  following information--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the consumer's claim or the warranty claim  related to the substitute check, including why the bank believes that  the substitute check may not be properly charged to the consumer  account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement that the claimant bank is obligated to recredit a  consumer account under Sec. 229.54 or otherwise has suffered a loss and  an estimate of the amount of that recredit or loss, including interest  if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reason why production of the original check or a  sufficient copy is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to  the consumer account or the warranty claim; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sufficient information to allow the indemnifying bank to  identify the substitute check and investigate the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requirements relating to copies of substitute checks. If the  information submitted by a claimant bank under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section includes a copy of any substitute check, the claimant bank shall  take reasonable steps to ensure that the copy cannot be mistaken for the  legal equivalent of the check under Sec. 229.51(a) or sent or handled by  any bank, including the indemnifying bank, for forward collection or  return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Form and submission of claim; computation of time. The  indemnifying bank may, in its discretion, require the claimant bank to  submit the information required by this section in writing, including a  copy of the paper or electronic claim submitted by the consumer, if any.  An indemnifying bank that requires a written submission--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May permit the claimant bank to submit the written claim  electronically;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall inform a claimant bank that submits a claim orally of the  written claim requirement at the time of the oral claim; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shall compute the 10-day time period for acting on the claim  described in paragraph (c) of this section from the date on which the  bank received the written claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action on claims. No later than the 10th business day after the  banking day on which the indemnifying bank receives a claim that meets  the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the indemnifying bank  shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim, up to  the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide to the claimant bank the original check or a sufficient  copy; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide information to the claimant bank regarding why the  indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply with paragraph (c)(1) or  (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recredit does not abrogate other liabilities. Providing a  recredit to a claimant bank under this section does not absolve the  indemnifying bank from liability for claims brought under any other law  or from additional damages under Sec. 229.53 or Sec. 229.56.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Indemnifying bank's right to a refund. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a claimant bank  reverses a recredit it previously made to a consumer account under  Sec. 229.54 or otherwise receives reimbursement for a substitute check  that formed the basis of its claim under this section, the claimant bank  shall provide a refund promptly to any indemnifying bank that previously  advanced funds to the claimant bank. The amount of the refund to the  indemnifying bank shall be the amount of the reversal or reimbursement  obtained by the claimant bank, up to the amount previously advanced by  the indemnifying bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section,  Sec. 229.53(b)(3) governs the indemnifying bank's entitlement to  repayment of any amount provided to the claimant bank that exceeds the  amount of losses the claimant bank incurred up to that time.</p>
