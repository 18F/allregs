                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form of notice granting a request. After the FOIA Officer has  made a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, the  requester will be notified in writing. The notice shall describe the  manner in which the record will be disclosed, whether by providing a  copy of the record with the response or at a later date, or by making a  copy of the record available to the requester for inspection at a  reasonable time and place. The procedure for such an inspection may not  unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Office. The response letter  will also inform the requester in the response of any fees to be charged  in accordance with the provisions of subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of notice denying a request. When the FOIA Officer denies a  request in whole or in part, he will so notify the requester in writing.  The response will be signed by the FOIA Officer and will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and title or position of the person making the denial;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A brief statement of the reason or reasons for the denial,  including the FOIA exemption or exemptions which the FOIA Officer has  relied upon in denying the request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When only a portion of a document is being withheld, the amount  of information deleted and the FOIA exemption(s) justifying the deletion  will generally be indicated on the copy of the released portion of the  document. If technically feasible, such indications will appear at the  place in the copy of the document where any deletion is made. If a  document is withheld in its entirety, an estimate of the volume of the  withheld material will generally be given. However, neither an  indication of the amount of information deleted nor an estimation of the  volume of material withheld will be included in a response if doing so  would harm an interest protected by any of the FOIA exemptions pursuant  to which the deletion or withholding is made; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement that the denial may be appealed under Sec. 2604.304  of this subpart, and a description of the requirements of that section.
