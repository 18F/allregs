Sec.  292.309 and 292.310 relieving an electric utility of its obligation to  purchase electric energy, a qualifying cogeneration facility, a  qualifying small power production facility, a State agency, or any other  affected person may apply to the Commission for an order reinstating the  electric utility's obligation to purchase electric energy under this  section. Such application shall set forth the factual basis upon which  the application is based and describe why the conditions set forth in  Sec. 292.309(a), (b) or (c) are no longer met. After notice, including  sufficient notice to potentially affected electric utilities, and  opportunity for comment, the Commission shall issue an order within 90  days of such application reinstating the electric utility's obligation  to purchase electric energy under this section if the Commission finds  that the conditions set forth in Sec. 292.309(a), (b), or (c) which  relieved the obligation to purchase, are no longer met.
