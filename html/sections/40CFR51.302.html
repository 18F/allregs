This consultation must include the opportunity for the  affected Federal Land Managers to discuss their:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assessment of impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I  Federal area, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recommendations on the development of the long-term strategy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan must provide procedures for continuing consultation  between the State and Federal Land Manager on the implementation of the  visibility protection program required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General plan requirements for reasonably attributable visibility  impairment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The affected Federal Land Manager may certify to the  State, at any time, that there exists reasonably attributable impairment  of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plan must contain the following to address reasonably  attributable impairment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A long-term (10-15 years) strategy, as specified in Sec. 51.305  and Sec. 51.306, including such emission limitations, schedules of  compliance, and such other measures including schedules for the  implementation of the elements of the long-term strategy as may be  necessary to make reasonable progress toward the national goal specified  in Sec. 51.300(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An assessment of visibility impairment and a discussion of how  each element of the plan relates to the preventing of future or  remedying of existing impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I  Federal area within the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Emission limitations representing BART and schedules for  compliance with BART for each existing stationary facility identified  according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan must require each source to maintain control equipment  required by this subpart and establish procedures to ensure such control  equipment is properly operated and maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any existing reasonably attributable visibility impairment  the Federal Land Manager certifies to the   State under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, at least 6 months prior to  plan submission or revision:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State must identify and analyze for BART each existing  stationary facility which may reasonably be anticipated to cause or  contribute to impairment of visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal  area where the impairment in the mandatory Class I Federal area is  reasonably attributable to that existing stationary facility. The State  need not consider any integral vista the Federal Land Manager did not  identify pursuant to Sec. 51.304(b) at least 6 months before plan  submission.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the State determines that technologicial or economic  limitations on the applicability of measurement methodology to a  particular existing stationary facility would make the imposition of an  emission standard infeasible it may instead prescribe a design,  equipment, work practice, or other operational standard, or combination  thereof, to require the application of BART. Such standard, to the  degree possible, is to set forth the emission reduction to be achieved  by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation,  and must provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent  results.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> BART must be determined for fossil-fuel fired generating  plants having a total generating capacity in excess of 750 megawatts  pursuant to ``Guidelines for Determining Best Available Retrofit  Technology for Coal-fired Power Plants and Other Existing Stationary  Facilities'' (1980), which is incorporated by reference, exclusive of  appendix E to the Guidelines, except that options more stringent than  NSPS must be considered. Establishing a BART emission limitation  equivalent to the NSPS level of control is not a sufficient basis to  avoid the analysis of control options required by the guidelines.
