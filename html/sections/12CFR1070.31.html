                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Only the General Counsel is authorized to receive and accept  summonses or complaints sought to be served upon the CFPB or CFPB  employees sued in their official capacity. Such documents should be  served upon the General Counsel, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552. This authorization for receipt  shall in no way affect the requirements of service elsewhere provided in  applicable rules and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, any summons  or complaint described in that paragraph is delivered to an employee of  the CFPB, the employee shall decline to accept the proffered service and  may notify   the person attempting to make service of the regulations set forth  herein. If, notwithstanding this instruction, an employee accepts  service of a document described in paragraph (a) of this section, the  employee shall immediately notify and deliver a copy of the summons and  complaint to the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a CFPB employee is sued in an individual capacity for an  act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on behalf  of the CFPB (whether or not the officer or employee is also sued in an  official capacity), the employee by law is to be served personally with  process. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(i)(3). An employee sued in an individual  capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties  performed on behalf of the CFPB shall immediately notify, and deliver a  copy of the summons and complaint to, the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The CFPB will only accept service of process for an employee  sued in his or her official capacity. Documents for which the General  Counsel accepts service in official capacity shall be stamped ``Service  Accepted in Official Capacity Only.'' Acceptance of service shall not  constitute an admission or waiver with respect to jurisdiction,  propriety of service, improper venue, or any other defense in law or  equity available under applicable laws or rules.</p>
