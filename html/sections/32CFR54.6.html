The Military  Services will not be required to vary their normal military allotment  payment cycle to comply with the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If several notices are sent with respect to the same member,  payments shall be satisfied on a first-come, first-served basis within  the amount limitations in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the member identified in the notice is found not to be  entitled to money due from or payable by the Military Service, the  designated official shall return the notice to the authorized person and  shall advise him or her that no money is due from or payable by the  Military Service to the named individual.
