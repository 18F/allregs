                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the definitions provided in 40 CFR 122.2, the  following special definitions apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Actual Intake Flow (AIF) means the average volume of water  withdrawn on an annual basis by the cooling water intake structures over  the past three years. After October 14, 2019, Actual Intake Flow means  the average volume of water withdrawn on an annual basis by the cooling  water intake structures over the previous five years. Actual intake flow  is measured at a location within the cooling water intake structure that  the Director deems appropriate. The calculation of actual intake flow  includes days of zero flow. AIF does not include flows associated with  emergency and fire suppression capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All life stages of fish and shellfish means eggs, larvae,  juveniles, and adults. It does not include members of the infraclass  Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea (barnacles), green mussels (Perna  viridis), or zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). The Director may  determine that all life stages of   fish and shellfish does not include other specified nuisance species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Closed-cycle recirculating system means a system designed and  properly operated using minimized make-up and blowdown flows withdrawn  from a water of the United States to support contact or non-contact  cooling uses within a facility, or a system designed to include certain  impoundments. A closed-cycle recirculating system passes cooling water  through the condenser and other components of the cooling system and  reuses the water for cooling multiple times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Closed-cycle recirculating system includes a facility with wet,  dry, or hybrid cooling towers, a system of impoundments that are not  waters of the United States, or any combination thereof. A properly  operated and maintained closed-cycle recirculating system withdraws new  source water (make-up water) only to replenish losses that have occurred  due to blowdown, drift, and evaporation. If waters of the United States  are withdrawn for purposes of replenishing losses to a closed-cycle  recirculating system other than those due to blowdown, drift, and  evaporation from the cooling system, the Director may determine a  cooling system is a closed-cycle recirculating system if the facility  demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that make-up water  withdrawals attributed specifically to the cooling portion of the  cooling system have been minimized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Closed-cycle recirculating system also includes a system with  impoundments of waters of the U.S. where the impoundment was constructed  prior to October 14, 2014 and created for the purpose of serving as part  of the cooling water system as documented in the project purpose  statement for any required Clean Water Act section 404 permit obtained  to construct the impoundment. In the case of an impoundment whose  construction pre-dated the CWA requirement to obtain a section 404  permit, documentation of the project's purpose must be demonstrated to  the satisfaction of the Director. This documentation could be some other  license or permit obtained to lawfully construct the impoundment for the  purposes of a cooling water system, or other such evidence as the  Director finds necessary. For impoundments constructed in uplands or not  in waters of the United States, no documentation of a section 404 or  other permit is required. If waters of the United States are withdrawn  for purposes of replenishing losses to a closed-cycle recirculating  system other than those due to blowdown, drift, and evaporation from the  cooling system, the Director may determine a cooling system is a closed- cycle recirculating system if the facility demonstrates to the  satisfaction of the Director that make-up water withdrawals attributed  specifically to the cooling portion of the cooling system have been  minimized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contact cooling water means water used for cooling which comes  into direct contact with any raw material, product, or byproduct.  Examples of contact cooling water may include but are not limited to  quench water at facilities, cooling water in a cracking unit, and  cooling water directly added to food and agricultural products  processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cooling water means water used for contact or non-contact  cooling, including water used for equipment cooling, evaporative cooling  tower makeup, and dilution of effluent heat content. The intended use of  the cooling water is to absorb waste heat rejected from the process or  processes used, or from auxiliary operations on the facility's premises.  Cooling water obtained from a public water system, reclaimed water from  wastewater treatment facilities or desalination plants, treated effluent  from a manufacturing facility, or cooling water that is used in a  manufacturing process either before or after it is used for cooling as  process water, is not considered cooling water for the purposes of  calculating the percentage of a facility's intake flow that is used for  cooling purposes in Sec. 125.91(a)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cooling water intake structure means the total physical  structure and any associated constructed waterways used to withdraw  cooling water from waters of the United States. The cooling water intake  structure extends from the point at which water is first withdrawn from  waters of the United States up to, and including the intake pumps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Design intake flow (DIF) means the value assigned during the  cooling water intake structure design to the maximum instantaneous rate  of flow of water the cooling water intake system is capable of  withdrawing from a source waterbody. The facility's DIF may be adjusted  to reflect permanent changes to the maximum capabilities of the cooling  water intake system to withdraw cooling water, including pumps  permanently removed from service, flow limit devices, and physical  limitations of the piping. DIF does not include values associated with  emergency and fire suppression capacity or redundant pumps (i.e., back- up pumps).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Entrainment means any life stages of fish and shellfish in the  intake water flow entering and passing through a cooling water intake  structure and into a cooling water system, including the condenser or  heat exchanger. Entrainable organisms include any organisms potentially  subject to entrainment. For purposes of this subpart, entrainment  excludes those organisms that are collected or retained by a sieve with  maximum opening dimension of 0.56 inches. Examples of sieves meeting  this definition include but are not limited to a \3/8\ inch square mesh,  or a \1/2\ by \1/4\ inch mesh. A facility must use the same mesh size  when counting entrainment as is used when counting impingement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Entrainment mortality means death as a result of entrainment  through the cooling water intake structure, or death as a result of  exclusion from the cooling water intake structure by fine mesh screens  or other protective devices intended to prevent the passage of  entrainable organisms through the cooling water intake structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Entrapment means the condition where impingeable fish and  shellfish lack the means to escape the cooling water intake. Entrapment  includes but is not limited to: Organisms caught in the bucket of a  traveling screen and unable to reach a fish return; organisms caught in  the forebay of a cooling water intake system without any means of being  returned to the source waterbody without experiencing mortality; or  cooling water intake systems where the velocities in the intake pipes or  in any channels leading to the forebay prevent organisms from being able  to return to the source waterbody through the intake pipe or channel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Existing facility means any facility that commenced construction  as described in 40 CFR 122.29(b)(4) on or before January 17, 2002 (or  July 17, 2006 for an offshore oil and gas extraction facility) and any  modification of, or any addition of a unit at such a facility. A  facility built adjacent to another facility would be a new facility  while the original facility would remain as an exiting facility for  purposes of this subpart. A facility cannot both be an existing facility  and a new facility as defined at Sec. 125.83.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Flow reduction means any modification to a cooling water intake  structure or its operation that serves to reduce the volume of cooling  water withdrawn. Examples include, but are not limited to, variable  speed pumps, seasonal flow reductions, wet cooling towers, dry cooling  towers, hybrid cooling towers, unit closures, or substitution for  withdrawals by reuse of effluent from a nearby facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Fragile species means those species of fish and shellfish that  are least likely to survive any form of impingement. For purposes of  this subpart, fragile species are defined as those with an impingement  survival rate of less than 30 percent, including but not limited to  alewife, American shad, Atlantic herring, Atlantic long-finned squid,  Atlantic menhaden, bay anchovy, blueback herring, bluefish, butterfish,  gizzard shad, grey snapper, hickory shad, menhaden, rainbow smelt, round  herring, and silver anchovy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Impingement means the entrapment of any life stages of fish and  shellfish on the outer part of an intake structure or against a  screening device during periods of intake water withdrawal. For purposes  of this subpart, impingement includes those organisms collected or  retained on a sieve with maximum distance in the opening of 0.56 inches,  and excludes those organisms that pass through the sieve. Examples of  sieves meeting this definition include but are not limited to a \3/8\  inch square mesh, or a \1/2\ by \1/4\ inch mesh. This definition is  intended to prevent the conversion of entrainable   organisms to counts of impingement or impingement mortality. The owner  or operator of a facility must use a sieve with the same mesh size when  counting entrainment as is used when counting impingement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Impingement mortality (IM) means death as a result of  impingement. Impingement mortality also includes organisms removed from  their natural ecosystem and lacking the ability to escape the cooling  water intake system, and thus subject to inevitable mortality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Independent supplier means an entity, other than the regulated  facility, that owns and operates its own cooling water intake structure  and directly withdraws water from waters of the United States. The  supplier provides the cooling water to other facilities for their use,  but may itself also use a portion of the water. An entity that provides  potable water to residential populations (e.g., public water system) is  not a supplier for purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Latent mortality means the delayed mortality of organisms that  were initially alive upon being impinged or entrained but that do not  survive the delayed effects of impingement and entrainment during an  extended holding period. Delayed effects of impingement and entrainment  include but are not limited to temperature change, physical stresses,  and chemical stresses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Minimize means to reduce to the smallest amount, extent, or  degree reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Modified traveling screen means a traveling water screen that  incorporates measures protective of fish and shellfish, including but  not limited to: Screens with collection buckets or equivalent mechanisms  designed to minimize turbulence to aquatic life; addition of a guard  rail or barrier to prevent loss of fish from the collection system;  replacement of screen panel materials with smooth woven mesh, drilled  mesh, molded mesh, or similar materials that protect fish from descaling  and other abrasive injury; continuous or near-continuous rotation of  screens and operation of fish collection equipment to ensure any  impinged organisms are recovered as soon as practical; a low pressure  wash or gentle vacuum to remove fish prior to any high pressure spray to  remove debris from the screens; and a fish handling and return system  with sufficient water flow to return the fish directly to the source  water in a manner that does not promote predation or re-impingement of  the fish, or require a large vertical drop. The Director may approve of  fish being returned to water sources other than the original source  water, taking into account any recommendations from the Services with  respect to endangered or threatened species. Examples of modified  traveling screens include, but are not limited to: Modified Ristroph  screens with a fish handling and return system, dual flow screens with  smooth mesh, and rotary screens with fish returns or vacuum returns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Moribund means dying; close to death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> New unit means a new ``stand-alone'' unit at an existing  facility where construction of the new unit begins after October 14,  2014 and that does not otherwise meet the definition of a new facility  at Sec. 125.83 or is not otherwise already subject to subpart I of this  part. A stand-alone unit is a separate unit that is added to a facility  for either the same general industrial operation or another purpose. A  new unit may have its own dedicated cooling water intake structure, or  the new unit may use an existing or modified cooling water intake  structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Offshore velocity cap means a velocity cap located a minimum of  800 feet from the shoreline. A velocity cap is an open intake designed  to change the direction of water withdrawal from vertical to horizontal,  thereby creating horizontal velocity patterns that result in avoidance  of the intake by fish and other aquatic organisms. For purposes of this  subpart, the velocity cap must use bar screens or otherwise exclude  marine mammals, sea turtles, and other large aquatic organisms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Operational measure means a modification to any operation that  serves to minimize impact to all life stages of fish and shellfish from  the cooling water intake structure. Examples of operational measures  include, but are not limited to, more frequent rotation of traveling  screens, use of a low   pressure wash to remove fish prior to any high pressure spray to remove  debris, maintaining adequate volume of water in a fish return, and  debris minimization measures such as air sparging of intake screens and/ or other measures taken to maintain the design intake velocity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Social benefits means the increase in social welfare that  results from taking an action. Social benefits include private benefits  and those benefits not taken into consideration by private decision  makers in the actions they choose to take, including effects occurring  in the future. Benefits valuation involves measuring the physical and  biological effects on the environment from the actions taken. Benefits  are generally treated one or more of three ways: A narrative containing  a qualitative discussion of environmental effects, a quantified analysis  expressed in physical or biological units, and a monetized benefits  analysis in which dollar values are applied to quantified physical or  biological units. The dollar values in a social benefits analysis are  based on the principle of willingness-to-pay (WTP), which captures  monetary benefits by measuring what individuals are willing to forgo in  order to enjoy a particular benefit. Willingness-to-pay for nonuse  values can be measured using benefits transfer or a stated preference  survey.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Social costs means costs estimated from the viewpoint of  society, rather than individual stakeholders. Social cost represents the  total burden imposed on the economy; it is the sum of all opportunity  costs incurred associated with taking actions. These opportunity costs  consist of the value lost to society of all the goods and services that  will not be produced and consumed as a facility complies with permit  requirements, and society reallocates resources away from other  production activities and towards minimizing adverse environmental  impacts.
