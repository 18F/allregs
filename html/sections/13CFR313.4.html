A complete petition for an affirmative determination shall  contain the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The `Application for Federal Assistance' (Form SF-424) that  contains such information to allow EDA to determine that the petitioning  Community is significantly affected by the threat to, or the loss of,  jobs associated with one or more Cognizable Certifications;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable Cognizable Certification(s) upon which the  Community bases its petition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Such other information as EDA considers material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The petition for affirmative determination must contain  information about the impact(s) on the Community from the actual or  threatened loss of jobs attributable to trade that led to the applicable  Cognizable Certification(s) made by the Secretaries of Labor, Commerce  or Agriculture, in order for EDA to determine that the Community is  significantly affected.
