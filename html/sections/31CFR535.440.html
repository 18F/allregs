                                Sec. 535.440  Commercially reasonable interest rates.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 535.212 and 535.213, what is meant by  ``commercially reasonable rates'' depends on the particular  circumstances. In the case of time or savings deposits, the  ``commercially reasonable rate'' is that rate provided for by the  deposit agreement or applicable law. With respect to other obligations  where the rate remains to be determined, it is presently expected that  the ``commercially reasonable rate'' will be the rate agreed upon by the  bank and Iran. However, where a deposit has in fact operated as a demand  account under Treasury license, it would be appropriate to treat the  deposit for purposes of Sec. Sec. 535.212 and 535.213 as a non-interest  bearing account. Furthermore, in the event that the Iran-U.S Claims  Tribunal (the ``Tribunal'') determines that interest additional to that  agreed upon between the bank and Iran, or compensation or damages in  lieu of interest, is due Iran, then that amount determined by the  Tribunal to be owing to Iran shall be transferred as, or as part of, the  interest at ``commercially reasonable rates'' required to be transferred  pursuant to Sec. Sec. 535.212 and 535.213, regardless of any settlement  between the bank and Iran or any release or discharge that Iran may have  given the bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contingent interest of Iran in any liability for further or  additional interest, or compensation or damages in lieu of interest,  that may be claimed in, and determined by the Tribunal, constitutes an  interest of Iran in property for purposes of this part, and no agreement  between Iran and any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United  States is effective to extinguish such Iranian interest in property  unless so specifically licensed by the Treasury Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For deposits held as time deposits, no penalty shall be imposed  for early withdrawal. (In this connection, the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System has determined that application of the penalty  for early withdrawal of time deposits transferred before maturity,  pursuant to Sec. 535.213 is not required.)
