service(s), operating conditions, or valve designs associated with poorer than average emission performance. A superior performing valve technology is one for which a group of such valves has a leak frequency of less than 2 percent for specific applications in such a process unit.

The owner or operator shall continue to conduct performance trials as long as

no superior performing design or technology has been identified, except as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(vi) of this section.

The quality assurance program shall be developed considering the findings of the data analysis required under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, if applicable, the findings of the trial evaluation required in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, and the operating conditions in the process unit. The quality assurance program shall be reviewed and, as appropriate, updated each year as long as the process unit has 2 percent or more leaking valves.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The quality assurance program shall:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Establish minimum design standards for each category of valves. The design standards shall specify known critical parameters such as tolerance, manufacturer, materials of construction, previous usage, or other applicable identified critical parameters;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Require that all equipment orders specify the design standard (or minimum tolerances) for the valve;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Include a written procedure for bench testing of valves that specifies performance criteria for acceptance of valves and specifies criteria for the precision and accuracy of the test apparatus. All valves repaired off-line after preparation of the quality assurance plan shall be bench-tested for leaks. This testing may be conducted by the owner or operator of the process unit, by the vendor, or by a designated representative. The owner or operator shall install only those valves that have been documented through bench-testing to be nonleaking.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Require that all valves repaired on-line be monitored using the method specified in Sec. 63.180(b) of this subpart for leaks for 2 successive months, after repair.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Provide for an audit procedure for quality control of purchased equipment to ensure conformance with purchase specifications. The audit program may be conducted by the owner or operator of the process unit or by a designated representative.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Detail off-line valve maintenance and repair procedures. These procedures shall include provisions to ensure that rebuilt or refurbished valves will meet the design specifications for the valve type and will operate such that emissions are minimized.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The quality assurance program shall be established no later than the start of the third year of Phase III for plant sites with 400 or more valves or owned by a corporation with 100 or more employees; and no later than the start of the fourth year of Phase III for plant sites with less than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with less than 100 employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Beginning at the start of the third year of Phase III for plant sites with 400 or more valves or owned by a corporation with 100 or more employees and at the start of the fourth year of Phase III for plant sites with less than 400 valves and owned by a corporation with less than 100 employees, each valve that is replaced for any reason shall be replaced with a new or modified valve that complies with the quality assurance standards for the valve category and that is identified as superior emission performance technology. Superior emission performance technology means valves or valve technologies identified with emission performance that, combined with appropriate process, operating, and maintenance practices, will result in less than 2 percent leaking valves for specific applications in a large population, except as provided in paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The valves shall be maintained as specified in the quality assurance program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a superior emission performance technology cannot be identified, then valve replacement shall be with one of (if several) the lowest emission performance technologies that has been identified for the specific application.
