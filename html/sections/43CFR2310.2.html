                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following provisions apply only to applications or proposals to withdraw lands and not to applications or proposals seeking to modify or extend withdrawals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals submitted on or after October 21, 1976. Within 30 days of the submission for filing of a withdrawal application, or whenever a withdrawal proposal is made, a notice stating that the application has been submitted or that the proposal has been made, shall be published in the Federal Register by the authorized officer. Publication of the notice in the Federal Register shall segregate the lands described in the application or proposal from settlement, sale, location or entry under the public land laws, including the mining laws, to the extent specified in the notice, for 2 years from the date of publication of the notice unless the segregative effect is terminated sooner in accordance with the provisions of this part. The notices published pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be the same notices required by Sec. 2310.3-1 of this title. Publication of a notice of a withdrawal application that is based on a prior withdrawal proposal, notice of which was published in the Federal Register, shall not operate to extend the segregation period which commenced upon the publication of the prior withdrawal proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal applications submitted before October 21, 1976. The public lands described in a withdrawal application filed before October 21, 1976, shall remain segregated through October 20, 1991, from settlement, sale, location or entry under the public land laws, including the mining laws, to the extent specified in the Federal Register notice or notices that pertain to the application, unless the segregative effect of the application is terminated sooner in accordance with other provisions of this part. Any amendment made on or after October 21, 1976, of a withdrawal application submitted before October 21, 1976, for the purpose of adding Federal lands to the lands described in a previous application, shall require the publication in the Federal Register, within 30 days of receipt of the amended application, of a notice of the amendment of the withdrawal application. All of the lands described in the amended application which includes those lands described in the original application shall be segregated for 2 years from the date of publication of the notice of the amended application in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applications for licenses, permits, cooperative agreements or other discretionary land use authorizations of a temporary nature that are filed on or after October 21, 1976, regarding lands involved in a withdrawal application or

a withdrawal proposal and that are listed in the notices required by Sec. 2310.3-2 of this title as permissible during the segregation period, may be approved by the authorized officer while the lands remain segregated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, applications for the use of lands involved in a withdrawal application or a withdrawal proposal, the allowance of which is discretionary, shall be denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The temporary segregation of lands in connection with a withdrawal application or a withdrawal proposal shall not affect in any respect Federal agency administrative jurisdiction of the lands, and the segregation shall not have the effect of authorizing or permitting any use of the lands by the applicant or using agency.


Sec. 2310.2-1  Termination of the segregative effect of withdrawal applications or withdrawal proposals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The publication in the Federal Register of an order allowing a withdrawal application, in whole or in part, shall terminate the segregative effect of the application as to those lands withdrawn by the order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The denial of a withdrawal application, in whole or in part, shall result in the termination of the segregative effect of the application or proposal as to those lands where the withdrawal is disallowed. Within 30 days following the decision to disallow the application or proposal, in whole or in part, the authorized officer shall publish a notice in the Federal Register specifying the reasons for the denial and the date that the segregative period terminated. The termination date of the segregation period shall be noted promptly on the public land status records on or before the termination date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The cancellation, in whole or in part, of a withdrawal application or a withdrawal proposal shall result in the termination of the segregative effect of the application or proposal, as to those lands deleted from the application or proposal. The authorized officer shall publish a notice in the Federal Register, within 30 days following the date of receipt of the cancellation, specifying the date that the segregation terminated. The termination date of the segregation shall be noted promptly on the public land status records. If the cancellation applies to only a portion of the public lands that are described in the withdrawal application or withdrawal proposal, then the lands that are not affected by the cancellation shall remain segregated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The segregative effect resulting from the publication on or after October 21, 1976, of a Federal Register notice of the submission of a withdrawal application or the making of a withdrawal proposal shall terminate 2 years after the publication date of the Federal Register notice unless the segregation is terminated sooner by other provisions of this section. A notice specifying the date and time of termination shall be published in the Federal Register by the authorized officer 30 days in advance of the termination date. The public land status records shall be noted as to the termination date of the segregation period on or before the termination date. Such a termination shall not affect the processing of the withdrawal application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The segregative effect resulting from the submission of a withdrawal application or withdrawal proposal before October 21, 1976, shall terminate on October 20, 1991, unless the segregation is terminated sooner by other provisions of this part. A notice specifying the date and time of termination shall be published in the Federal Register by the authorized officer 30 days in advance of October 20, 1991. The public land status records shall be noted as to the termination date of the segregation period on or before October 20, 1991.</p>
