                            <p class="depth0">As previously stated, the interpretations of the law contained in  this part are official interpretations. So long as they remain effective  and are not modified, amended, rescinded or determined by judicial  authority to be incorrect, they may be relied upon as provided in  section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (63 Stat. 910, 29 U.S.C.  251 et seq., discussed in part 790 of this chapter). In addition, the  Supreme Court has recognized that such interpretations of this Act  ``provide a practical guide to employers and employees as to how the  office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to  apply it'' and ``constitute a body of experience and informed judgment  to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.''  Further, as stated by the Court: ``Good administration of the Act and  good judicial administration alike require that the standards of public  enforcement and those for determining private rights shall be at  variance only where justified by very good reasons.'' (Skidmore v.  Swift, 323 U.S. 134).</p>
