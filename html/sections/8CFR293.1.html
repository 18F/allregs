                            <p class="depth0">Interest shall be computed from the date of deposit occurring after April 27, 1966, or from the date cash deposited in

the postal savings system ceased to accrue interest, to and including the date of withdrawal or date of breach of the immigration bond, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this section, the date of deposit shall be the date shown on the Receipt of Immigration Officer for the cash received as security on an immigration bond. The date of withdrawal shall be the date upon which the interest is certified to the Treasury Department for payment. The date of breach shall be the date as of which the immigration bond was concluded to have been breached as shown on Form I-323, Notice--Immigration Bond Breached. In counting the number of days for which interest shall be computed, the day on which the cash was deposited, or the day which cash deposited in the postal savings system ceased to accrue interest, shall not be counted; however, the day of withdrawal or the day of breach of the immigration bond shall be counted. Interest shall be computed at the rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and set forth in Sec. 293.2. The simple interest table in Sec. 293.3 shall be utilized in the computation of interest under this part.</p>
