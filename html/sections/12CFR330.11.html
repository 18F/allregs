If  a corporation has divisions or units which are not separately  incorporated, the deposit accounts of those divisions or units shall be  added to any other deposit accounts of the corporation. If a corporation  maintains deposit accounts in a representative or fiduciary capacity,  such accounts shall not be treated as the deposit accounts of the  corporation but shall be treated as fiduciary accounts and insured in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 330.7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> shall exist for any trust or other  business arrangement established by a state or that is a state agency or  state public instrumentality as part of a qualified tuition savings  program under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 529).  A deposit account of such a trust or business arrangement shall not be  deemed to be the deposit of a corporation provided that: The funds in  the account may be traced to one or more particular investors or  participants; and the existence of the trust relationships is disclosed  in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 330.5. If these conditions  are satisfied, each participant's funds shall be insured as a deposit  account of the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Partnership accounts. The deposit accounts of a partnership  engaged in any ``independent activity'' (as defined in Sec. 330.1(g))  shall be added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate.  Such insurance coverage shall be separate from any insurance provided  for individually owned (single ownership) accounts maintained by the  individual partners. A partnership shall be deemed to exist, for  purposes of this paragraph, any time there is an association of two or  more persons or entities formed to carry on, as co-owners, an  unincorporated business for profit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unincorporated association accounts. The deposit accounts of an  unincorporated association engaged in any independent activity shall be  added together and insured up to the SMDIA in the aggregate, separately  from the accounts of the person(s) or entity(ies) comprising the  unincorporated association. An unincorporated association shall be  deemed to exist, for purposes of this paragraph, whenever there is an  association of two or   more persons formed for some religious, educational, charitable, social  or other noncommercial purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-qualifying entities. The deposit accounts of an entity which  is not engaged in an ``independent activity'' (as defined in  Sec. 330.1(g)) shall be deemed to be owned by the person or persons  owning the corporation or comprising the partnership or unincorporated  association, and, for deposit insurance purposes, the interest of each  person in such a deposit account shall be added to any other deposit  accounts individually owned by that person and insured up to the SMDIA  in the aggregate.
