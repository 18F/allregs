                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions in this section apply to rigid plastic IBCs  intended to contain solids or liquids. Rigid plastic IBC types are  designated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 11H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the  whole load when IBCs are stacked, for solids which are loaded or  discharged by gravity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 11H2 freestanding, for solids which are loaded or discharged by  gravity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 21H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the  whole load when IBCs are stacked, for solids which are loaded or  discharged under pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 21H2 freestanding, for solids which are loaded or discharged  under pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 31H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the  whole load when IBCs are stacked, for liquids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 31H2 freestanding, for liquids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rigid plastic IBCs consist of a rigid plastic body, which may  have structural equipment, together with appropriate service equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rigid plastic IBCs must be manufactured from plastic material of   known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity and  to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance to  Sec. 173.24 of this subchapter, plastic materials must be resistant to  aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If protection against ultraviolet radiation is necessary, it  must be provided by the addition of a pigment or inhibiter such as  carbon black. These additives must be compatible with the contents and  remain effective throughout the life of the IBC body. Where use is made  of carbon black, pigments or inhibitors, other than those used in the  manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if  changes in the carbon black content, the pigment content or the  inhibitor content do not adversely affect the physical properties of the  material of construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additives may be included in the composition of the plastic  material to improve the resistance to aging or to serve other purposes,  provided they do not adversely affect the physical or chemical  properties of the material of construction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No used material other than production residues or regrind from  the same manufacturing process may be used in the manufacture of rigid  plastic IBCs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rigid plastic IBCs intended for the transportation of liquids  must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor to prevent the  body of the IBC from rupturing if it is subjected to an internal  pressure in excess of that for which it was hydraulically tested. This  may be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief  devices or by other means of construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rigid plastic IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater  than 3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).
