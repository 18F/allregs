                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of the calculations required by this part, a lender may not use the Rule of 78s to calculate the outstanding principal balance of a loan, except for a loan made to a borrower who entered repayment before June 26, 1987 and who was informed in the promissory note that interest on the loan would be calculated using the Rule of 78s. For those loans, the Rule of 78s must be used for the life of the loan.
