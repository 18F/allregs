Performance test data must be submitted in the file format  generated through use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see  http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html). Only data collected using  test methods on the ERT Web site are   subject to this requirement for submitting reports electronically to  WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information  being submitted for performance tests is confidential business  information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information  claimed to be CBI on a compact disk, flash drive or other commonly used  electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be  clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office,  Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham,  NC 27703.

At the  discretion of the delegated authority, you must also submit these  reports, including the confidential business information, to the  delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority.  For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not  listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator shall submit the  results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate  address listed in Sec. 63.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ongoing compliance status reports for major sources. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  owner or operator of an affected source that is located at a major  source site shall submit a summary report to the Administrator to  document the ongoing compliance status of the affected source.

Once an owner or operator of an affected source reports an  exceedance, ongoing compliance status reports shall be submitted  quarterly until a request to reduce reporting frequency under paragraph  (g)(2) of this section is approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request to reduce frequency of ongoing compliance status  reports. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator who is required to submit ongoing  compliance status reports on a quarterly (or more frequent basis) may  reduce the frequency of reporting to semiannual if all of the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting  periods), the ongoing compliance status reports demonstrate that the  affected source is in compliance with the relevant emission limit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The owner or operator continues to comply with all applicable  recordkeeping and monitoring requirements of subpart A of this part and  this subpart; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Administrator does not object to a reduced reporting  frequency for the affected source, as provided in paragraphs (g)(2) (ii)  and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The frequency of submitting ongoing compliance status reports  may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the  Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change,  and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In  deciding whether to approve a reduced reporting frequency, the  Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire  previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period  prior to the intended change, or the recordkeeping period since the  source's compliance date, whichever is shorter. Records subject to  review may include performance test results, monitoring data, and  evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with emission  limitations and work practice standards. Such information may be used by  the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for  noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner  or operator's request to reduce reporting frequency, the Administrator  will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after  receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification  from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds  on which the disapproval is   based.
