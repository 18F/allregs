Sec. 291.90(a) or 291.200 will offer former mortgagors in occupancy who have defaulted on the mortgage the right of first refusal to repurchase the same property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HUD will offer tenants accepted under the occupied conveyance procedures outlined in 24 CFR 203.670 through 203.685 the right of first refusal to purchase the property only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The tenant has a recognized ability to acquire financing and a good

A property that requires no more than $5,000 for repairs to meet the MPS, as determined by the Secretary, will be offered for sale in ``as-is'' condition with FHA mortgage insurance available, provided the mortgagor establishes a cash escrow to ensure the completion of the required repairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Uninsured. A property that fails to qualify under either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section will be offered for sale either in ``as-is'' condition without mortgage insurance available, or in ``as-is'' condition under section 203(k) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(k)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Financing.

Mortgagors must meet FHA mortgage credit standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Purchase money mortgage (PMM). For purposes of this section, the term ``purchase money mortgage,'' or PMM means a note secured by a mortgage or trust deed given by a buyer, as mortgagor, to the seller, as mortgagee, as part of the purchase price of the real estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Environmental requirements and standards.

Real estate brokers that are involved in Real Estate Owned (REO) sales will be removed from HUD's qualified selling broker list and will be prohibited from using HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned single family properties for good cause in accordance with the procedures of this paragraph. Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking such other action against a broker as provided in 24 CFR part 24 or from seeking any other available remedy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Good cause. Good cause includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conviction under 18 U.S.C. 371 or 1010 of a broker or an agent supervised by that broker and acting within the scope of the agent's duties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any of the following actions by a broker or an agent supervised by that broker and acting within the scope of the agent's duties:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Falsifying loan documents or aiding or abetting persons in the use of false or misleading information including, but not limited to, forged or fraudulent gift letters and owner occupant certifications;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Acting in concert with an appraiser to arrive at an artificial appraised value;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Engaging in fraudulent activities (with or without the assistance of an appraiser) that have led to default and payment of an insurance claim;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Failing to comply with earnest money collection, management, and disbursement procedures as set forth in this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Failing to maintain a current state license;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Violating the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Non-compliance with civil rights requirements regarding the sale of HUD-owned single family properties;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Involvement in, or knowledge of, any fraudulent activity by any person involved in the REO sales transaction; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Any other actions or omissions that evidence a lack of business integrity or non-compliance with the laws, regulations, and rules applicable to housing, lending, or real estate sales.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written notice. Once HUD makes an initial finding that there is good cause to remove a broker, HUD will provide the broker with written notice of proposed removal from HUD's qualified selling broker list and deactivation of the broker's access to HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned properties. The notice will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the reasons that HUD is taking the action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the violations or deficiencies involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a citation to the relevant regulation, statute, or policy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> State the effective date and duration of the removal and deactivation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective date and duration of removal. (i) The effective date of the broker's removal will be the 30th day after the date of the notice, unless the broker submits a written response or requests a conference in accordance with paragraph (i)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The effective date of the broker's removal will be the 30th day after the date of the notice, unless the broker submits a written response or requests a conference in accordance with paragraph (i)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> HUD's determination of the duration of removal and deactivation will be based upon HUD's consideration of the number and seriousness of the broker's violations and deficiencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Response and conference. Real estate brokers will be given 20 days after the date of the notice (or longer, if provided in the notice) to submit a written response to HUD opposing the proposed removal and to request a conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted along with the written response. If a conference is requested, it will occur within 15 days after the date of receipt of the request. HUD may extend the 15-day period by providing written notice to the broker. HUD may request additional information at or following a conference and provide additional time to submit such information. If the information is not submitted by the time set by HUD, the conference is completed. If the information is timely submitted, the conference is not completed until HUD has considered the additional information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Disposition. (i) No response from real estate broker. If the real estate broker does not submit a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation take effect in accordance with the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No response from real estate broker. If the real estate broker does not submit a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation take effect in accordance with the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Response from real estate broker. If the real estate broker submits a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation are delayed until HUD considers the response and makes a final determination. HUD will consider the sufficiency of any corrective actions taken by a broker with respect to its procedures and, if relevant, its agents, in reaching its decision. Within 20 days after the date of receipt of the written response, or if a conference is requested, within 20 days after the date of completion of the conference, HUD will advise the real estate broker in writing of the decision to rescind, modify, or affirm the removal from HUD's qualified selling broker list and the deactivation of the broker's access to HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned properties. The written decision by HUD shall constitute final agency action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Effect of removal proceeding on bids. All bids submitted and commissions earned by the real estate broker prior to removal will be honored, unless HUD determines they were made under fraudulent circumstances.
