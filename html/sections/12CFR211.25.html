                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for termination--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Under sections 7(e) and  10(b) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3105(d), 3107(b)), the Board may order a  foreign bank to terminate the activities of its representative office,  state branch, state agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary if  the Board finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive consolidated  supervision in accordance with Sec. 211.24(c)(1), and the home country  supervisor is not making demonstrable progress in establishing  arrangements for the consolidated supervision of the foreign bank; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Both of the following criteria are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> There is reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank, or  any of its affiliates, has committed a violation of law or engaged in an  unsafe or unsound banking practice in the United States; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> As a result of such violation or practice, the continued  operation of the foreign bank's representative office, state branch,  state agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary would not be  consistent with the public interest, or with the purposes of the IBA,  the BHC Act, or the FDIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional ground. The Board also may enforce any condition  imposed in connection with an order issued under Sec. 211.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Factor. In making its findings under this section, the Board may  take into account the needs of the community, the history of operation  of the foreign bank, and its relative size in its home country, provided  that the size of the foreign bank shall not be the sole determining  factor in a decision to terminate an office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consultation with relevant state supervisor. Except in the case  of termination pursuant to the expedited procedure in paragraph (d)(3)  of this section, the Board shall request and consider the views of the  relevant state supervisor before issuing an order terminating the  activities of a state branch, state agency, representative office, or  commercial lending company subsidiary under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(3)</em> of this section, an order issued  under paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section shall be issued only after notice  to the relevant state supervisor and the foreign bank and after an  opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures for hearing. Hearings under this section shall be  conducted pursuant to the Board's Rules of Practice for Hearings (12 CFR  part 263).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expedited procedure. The Board may act without providing an  opportunity for a hearing, if it determines that expeditious action is  necessary in order to protect the public interest. When the Board finds  that it is necessary to act without providing an opportunity for a  hearing, the Board, solely in its discretion, may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide the foreign bank that is the subject of the termination  order with notice of the intended termination order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Grant the foreign bank an opportunity to present a written  submission opposing issuance of the order; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Take any other action designed to provide the foreign bank  with notice and an opportunity to present its views concerning the  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination of federal branch or federal agency. The Board may  transmit to the Comptroller a recommendation that the license of a  federal branch or federal agency be terminated if the Board has  reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank or any affiliate of  the foreign bank has engaged in conduct for which the activities of a  state branch or state agency may be terminated pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> is in addition to, and does not satisfy,  any other federal or state requirements relating to the termination of  an office or the requirement   for prior notice of the closing of a branch, pursuant to section 39 of  the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831p).</p>
