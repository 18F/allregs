                                Sec. 1610.4  Resource management planning process.

Sec. 1610.4-1  Identification of issues.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">At the outset of the planning process, the public, other Federal agencies, State and local governments and Indian tribes shall be given an opportunity to suggest concerns, needs, and resource use, development and protection opportunities for consideration in the preparation of the resource management plan. The Field Manager, in collaboration with any cooperating agencies, will analyze those suggestions and other available data, such as records of resource conditions, trends, needs, and problems, and select topics and determine the issues to be addressed during the planning process. Issues may be modified during the planning process to incorporate new information. The identification of issues shall also comply with the scoping process required by regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.7).
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14566, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-2  Development of planning criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Field Manager will prepare criteria to guide development of the resource management plan or revision, to ensure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is tailored to the issues previously identified; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That BLM avoids unnecessary data collection and analyses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Planning criteria will generally be based upon applicable law, Director and State Director guidance, the results of public participation, and coordination with any cooperating agencies and other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> BLM will make proposed planning criteria, including any significant changes, available for public comment prior to being approved by the Field Manager for use in the planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> BLM may change planning criteria as planning proceeds if we determine that public suggestions or study and assessment findings make such changes desirable.
[70 FR 14566, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-3  Inventory data and information collection.</p><p class="depth0">The Field Manager, in collaboration with any cooperating agencies, will arrange for resource, environmental, social, economic and institutional data

and information to be collected, or assembled if already available. New information and inventory data collection will emphasize significant issues and decisions with the greatest potential impact. Inventory data and information shall be collected in a manner that aids application in the planning process, including subsequent monitoring requirements.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14566, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-4  Analysis of the management situation.</p><p class="depth0">The Field Manager, in collaboration with any cooperating agencies, will analyze the inventory data and other information available to determine the ability of the resource area to respond to identified issues and opportunities. The analysis of the management situation shall provide, consistent with multiple use principles, the basis for formulating reasonable alternatives, including the types of resources for development or protection. Factors to be considered may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The types of resource use and protection authorized by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and other relevant legislation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opportunities to meet goals and objectives defined in national and State Director guidance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Resource demand forecasts and analyses relevant to the resource area;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The estimated sustained levels of the various goods, services and uses that may be attained under existing biological and physical conditions and under differing management practices and degrees of management intensity which are economically viable under benefit cost or cost effectiveness standards prescribed in national or State Director guidance;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Specific requirements and constraints to achieve consistency with policies, plans and programs of other Federal agencies, State and local government agencies and Indian tribes;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunities to resolve public issues and management concerns;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Degree of local dependence on resources from public lands;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The extent of coal lands which may be further considered under provisions of Sec. 3420.2-3(a) of this title; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Critical threshold levels which should be considered in the formulation of planned alternatives.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14566, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-5  Formulation of alternatives.</p><p class="depth2">At the direction of the Field Manager, in collaboration with any cooperating agencies, BLM will consider all reasonable resource management alternatives and develop several complete alternatives for detailed study. Nonetheless, the decision to designate alternatives for further development and analysis remains the exclusive responsibility of the BLM. The alternatives developed shall reflect the variety of issues and guidance applicable to the resource uses. In order to limit the total number of alternatives analyzed in detail to a manageable number for presentation and analysis, all reasonable variations shall be treated as subalternatives. One alternative shall be for no action, which means continuation of present level or systems of resource use. The plan shall note any alternatives identified and eliminated from detailed study and shall briefly discuss the reasons for their elimination.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-6  Estimation of effects of alternatives.</p><p class="depth2">The Field Manager, in collaboration with any cooperating agencies, will estimate and display the physical, biological, economic, and social effects of implementing each alternative considered in detail. The estimation of effects shall be guided by the planning criteria and procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. The estimate may be stated in terms of probable ranges where effects cannot be precisely determined.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]



Sec. 1610.4-7  Selection of preferred alternatives.</p><p class="depth2">The Field Manager, in collaboration with any cooperating agencies, will evaluate the alternatives, estimate their effects according to the planning criteria, and identify a preferred alternative that best meets Director and State Director guidance. Nonetheless, the decision to select a preferred alternative remains the exclusive responsibility of the BLM. The resulting draft resource management plan and draft environmental impact statement shall be forwarded to the State Director for approval, publication, and filing with the Environmental Protection Agency. This draft plan and environmental impact statement shall be provided for comment to the Governor of the State involved, and to officials of other Federal agencies, State and local governments and Indian tribes that the State Director has reason to believe would be concerned. This action shall constitute compliance with the requirements of Sec. 3420.1-7 of this title.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-8  Selection of resource management plan.</p><p class="depth2">After publication of the draft resource management plan and draft environmental impact statement, the Field Manager shall evaluate the comments received and select and recommend to the State Director, for supervisory review and publication, a proposed resource management plan and final environmental impact statement. After supervisory review of the proposed resource management plan, the State Director shall publish the plan and file the related environmental impact statement.
[48 FR 20368, May 5, 1983, as amended at 70 FR 14567, Mar. 23, 2005]


Sec. 1610.4-9  Monitoring and evaluation.</p><p class="depth2">The proposed plan shall establish intervals and standards, as appropriate, for monitoring and evaluation of the plan. Such intervals and standards shall be based on the sensitivity of the resource to the decisions involved and shall provide for evaluation to determine whether mitigation measures are satisfactory, whether there has been significant change in the related plans of other Federal agencies, State or local governments, or Indian tribes, or whether there is new data of significance to the plan. The Field Manager shall be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the plan in accordance with the established intervals and standards and at other times as appropriate to determine whether there is sufficient cause to warrant amendment or revision of the plan.
