The Board may, at any time, on its own initiative or in  response to a written request from any person, initiate a proceeding to  determine whether any activity is so closely related to banking or  managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for determination.

In the  case of a request submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, the  Board may determine not to publish notice of the request if the Board  determines that the requester has provided no reasonable basis for a  determination that the activity is so closely related to banking, or  managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and  notifies the requester of the determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Comments and hearing requests.
