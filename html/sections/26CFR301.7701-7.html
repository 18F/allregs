                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) A trust is a United States person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A trust is a United States person if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust (court test); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> One or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (control test).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A trust is a United States person for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) on any day that the trust meets both the court test and the control test. For purposes of the regulations in this chapter, the term domestic trust means a trust that is a United States person. The term foreign trust means any trust other than a domestic trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except as otherwise provided in part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, the taxable income of a foreign trust is computed in the same manner as the taxable income of a nonresident alien individual who is not present in the United States at any time. Section 641(b). Section 7701(b) is not applicable to trusts because it only applies to individuals. In addition, a foreign trust is not considered to be present in the United States at any time for purposes of section 871(a)(2), which deals with capital gains of nonresident aliens present in the United States for 183 days or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicable law. The terms of the trust instrument and applicable law must be applied to determine whether the court test and the control test are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The court test--(1) Safe harbor. A trust satisfies the court test if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Safe harbor. A trust satisfies the court test if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The trust instrument does not direct that the trust be administered outside of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The trust in fact is administered exclusively in the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The trust is not subject to an automatic migration provision described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A creates a trust for the equal benefit of A's two children, B and C. The trust instrument provides that DC, a State Y corporation, is the trustee of the trust. State Y is a state within the United States. DC administers the trust exclusively in State Y and the trust instrument is silent as to where the trust is to be administered. The trust is not subject to an automatic migration provision described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The trust satisfies the safe harbor of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the court test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Court. The term court includes any federal, state, or local court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The United States. The term the United States is used in this section in a geographical sense. Thus, for purposes of the court test, the United States includes only the States and the District of Columbia. See section 7701(a)(9). Accordingly, a court within a territory or possession of the United States or within a foreign country is not a court within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is able to exercise. The term is able to exercise means that a court has or would have the authority under applicable law to render orders or judgments resolving issues concerning administration of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Primary supervision. The term primary supervision means that a court has or would have the authority to determine substantially all issues regarding the administration of the entire trust. A court may have primary supervision under this paragraph (c)(3)(iv) notwithstanding the fact that another court has jurisdiction over a trustee, a beneficiary, or trust property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Administration. The term administration of the trust means the carrying out of the duties imposed by the terms of the trust instrument and applicable law, including maintaining the books and records of the trust, filing tax returns, managing and investing the assets of the trust, defending the trust from suits by creditors, and determining the amount and timing of distributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Situations that cause a trust to satisfy or fail to satisfy the court test. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section set forth some specific situations in which a trust satisfies the court test. The four situations described are not intended to be an exclusive list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, paragraphs (c)(4)(i) (A) through (D) of this section set forth some specific situations in which a trust satisfies the court test. The four situations described are not intended to be an exclusive list.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Uniform Probate Code. A trust meets the court test if the trust is registered by an authorized fiduciary or fiduciaries of the trust in a court within the United States pursuant to a state statute that has provisions substantially similar to Article VII, Trust Administration, of the Uniform Probate Code, 8 Uniform Laws Annotated 1 (West Supp. 1998), available from the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, 676 North St. Clair Street, Suite 1700, Chicago, Illinois 60611.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Testamentary trust. In the case of a trust created pursuant to the terms of a will probated within the United States (other than an ancillary probate), if all fiduciaries of the trust have been qualified as trustees of the trust by a court within the United States, the trust meets the court test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Inter vivos trust. In the case of a trust other than a testamentary trust, if the fiduciaries and/or beneficiaries take steps with a court within the United States that cause the administration of the trust to be subject to the primary supervision of the court, the trust meets the court test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A United States court and a foreign court are able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust. If both a United States court and a foreign court are able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust, the trust meets the court test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatic migration provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a court within the United States is not considered to have

primary supervision over the administration of the trust if the trust instrument provides that a United States court's attempt to assert jurisdiction or otherwise supervise the administration of the trust directly or indirectly would cause the trust to migrate from the United States. However, this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) will not apply if the trust instrument provides that the trust will migrate from the United States only in the case of foreign invasion of the United States or widespread confiscation or nationalization of property in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a United States citizen, creates a trust for the equal benefit of A's two children, both of whom are United States citizens. The trust instrument provides that DC, a domestic corporation, is to act as trustee of the trust and that the trust is to be administered in Country X, a foreign country. DC maintains a branch office in Country X with personnel authorized to act as trustees in Country X. The trust instrument provides that the law of State Y, a state within the United States, is to govern the interpretation of the trust. Under the law of Country X, a court within Country X is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust. Pursuant to the trust instrument, the Country X court applies the law of State Y to the trust. Under the terms of the trust instrument the trust is administered in Country X. No court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust. The trust fails to satisfy the court test and therefore is a foreign trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A, a United States citizen, creates a trust for A's own benefit and the benefit of A's spouse, B, a United States citizen. The trust instrument provides that the trust is to be administered in State Y, a state within the United States, by DC, a State Y corporation. The trust instrument further provides that in the event that a creditor sues the trustee in a United States court, the trust will automatically migrate from State Y to Country Z, a foreign country, so that no United States court will have jurisdiction over the trust. A court within the United States is not able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust because the United States court's jurisdiction over the administration of the trust is automatically terminated in the event the court attempts to assert jurisdiction. Therefore, the trust fails to satisfy the court test from the time of its creation and is a foreign trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Control test--(1) Definitions--(i) United States person. The term United States person means a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). For example, a domestic corporation is a United States person, regardless of whether its shareholders are United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definitions--(i) United States person. The term United States person means a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). For example, a domestic corporation is a United States person, regardless of whether its shareholders are United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> United States person. The term United States person means a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). For example, a domestic corporation is a United States person, regardless of whether its shareholders are United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial decisions. The term substantial decisions means those decisions that persons are authorized or required to make under the terms of the trust instrument and applicable law and that are not ministerial. Decisions that are ministerial include decisions regarding details such as the bookkeeping, the collection of rents, and the execution of investment decisions. Substantial decisions include, but are not limited to, decisions concerning--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether and when to distribute income or corpus;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of any distributions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The selection of a beneficiary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Whether a receipt is allocable to income or principal;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Whether to terminate the trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Whether to compromise, arbitrate, or abandon claims of the trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Whether to sue on behalf of the trust or to defend suits against the trust;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Whether to remove, add, or replace a trustee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Whether to appoint a successor trustee to succeed a trustee who has died, resigned, or otherwise ceased to act as a trustee, even if the power to make such a decision is not accompanied by an unrestricted power to remove a trustee, unless the power to make such a decision is limited such that it cannot be exercised in a manner that would change the trust's residency from foreign to domestic, or vice versa; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Investment decisions; however, if a United States person under section 7701(a)(30) hires an investment advisor for the trust, investment decisions made by the investment advisor will be considered substantial decisions controlled by the United States person if the United States person can terminate the investment advisor's power to make investment decisions at will.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Control. The term control means having the power, by vote or otherwise, to make all of the substantial decisions

of the trust, with no other person having the power to veto any of the substantial decisions. To determine whether United States persons have control, it is necessary to consider all persons who have authority to make a substantial decision of the trust, not only the trust fiduciaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Safe harbor for certain employee benefit trusts and investment trusts. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), the trusts listed in this paragraph (d)(1)(iv) are deemed to satisfy the control test set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, provided that United States trustees control all of the substantial decisions made by the trustees of the trust--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A qualified trust described in section 401(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A trust described in section 457(g);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A trust that is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A trust that is an individual retirement account described in section 408(k) or 408(p);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A trust that is a Roth IRA described in section 408A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> A trust that is an education individual retirement account described in section 530;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A trust that is a voluntary employees' beneficiary association described in section 501(c)(9);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> A group trust described in Rev. Rul. 81-100 (1981-1 C.B. 326) (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> An investment trust classified as a trust under Sec. 301.7701-4(c), provided that the following conditions are satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All trustees are United States persons and at least one of the trustees is a bank, as defined in section 581, or a United States Government-owned agency or United States Government-sponsored enterprise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All sponsors (persons who exchange investment assets for beneficial interests with a view to selling the beneficial interests) are United States persons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The beneficial interests are widely offered for sale primarily in the United States to United States persons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Such additional categories of trusts as the Commissioner may designate in revenue procedures, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Trust is a testamentary trust with three fiduciaries, A, B, and C. A and B are United States citizens, and C is a nonresident alien. No persons except the fiduciaries have authority to make any decisions of the trust. The trust instrument provides that no substantial decisions of the trust can be made unless there is unanimity among the fiduciaries. The control test is not satisfied because United States persons do not control all the substantial decisions of the trust. No substantial decisions can be made without C's agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the trust instrument provides that all substantial decisions of the trust are to be decided by a majority vote among the fiduciaries. The control test is satisfied because a majority of the fiduciaries are United States persons and therefore United States persons control all the substantial decisions of the trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that the trust instrument directs that C is to make all of the trust's investment decisions, but that A and B may veto C's investment decisions. A and B cannot act to make the investment decisions on their own. The control test is not satisfied because the United States persons, A and B, do not have the power to make all of the substantial decisions of the trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except A and B may accept or veto C's investment decisions and can make investments that C has not recommended. The control test is satisfied because the United States persons control all substantial decisions of the trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. X, a foreign corporation, conducts business in the United States through various branch operations. X has United States employees and has established a trust as part of a qualified employee benefit plan under section 401(a) for these employees. The trust is established under the laws of State A, and the trustee of the trust is B, a United States bank governed by the laws of State A. B holds legal title to the trust assets for the benefit of the trust beneficiaries. A plan committee makes decisions with respect to the plan and the trust. The plan committee can direct B's actions with regard to those decisions and under the governing documents B is not liable for those decisions. Members of the plan committee consist of United States persons and nonresident

aliens, but nonresident aliens make up a majority of the plan committee. Decisions of the plan committee are made by majority vote. In addition, X retains the power to terminate the trust and to replace the United States trustee or to appoint additional trustees. This trust is deemed to satisfy the control test under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section because B, a United States person, is the trust's only trustee. Any powers held by the plan committee or X are not considered under the safe harbor of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. In the event that X appoints additional trustees including foreign trustees, any powers held by such trustees must be considered in determining whether United States trustees control all substantial decisions made by the trustees of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Replacement of any person who had authority to make a substantial decision of the trust--(i) Replacement within 12 months. In the event of an inadvertent change in any person that has the power to make a substantial decision of the trust that would cause the domestic or foreign residency of the trust to change, the trust is allowed 12 months from the date of the change to make necessary changes either with respect to the persons who control the substantial decisions or with respect to the residence of such persons to avoid a change in the trust's residency. For purposes of this section, an inadvertent change means the death, incapacity, resignation, change in residency or other change with respect to a person that has a power to make a substantial decision of the trust that would cause a change to the residency of the trust but that was not intended to change the residency of the trust. If the necessary change is made within 12 months, the trust is treated as retaining its pre-change residency during the 12-month period. If the necessary change is not made within 12 months, the trust's residency changes as of the date of the inadvertent change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Replacement within 12 months. In the event of an inadvertent change in any person that has the power to make a substantial decision of the trust that would cause the domestic or foreign residency of the trust to change, the trust is allowed 12 months from the date of the change to make necessary changes either with respect to the persons who control the substantial decisions or with respect to the residence of such persons to avoid a change in the trust's residency. For purposes of this section, an inadvertent change means the death, incapacity, resignation, change in residency or other change with respect to a person that has a power to make a substantial decision of the trust that would cause a change to the residency of the trust but that was not intended to change the residency of the trust. If the necessary change is made within 12 months, the trust is treated as retaining its pre-change residency during the 12-month period. If the necessary change is not made within 12 months, the trust's residency changes as of the date of the inadvertent change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Request for extension of time. If reasonable actions have been taken to make the necessary change to prevent a change in trust residency, but due to circumstances beyond the trust's control the trust is unable to make the modification within 12 months, the trust may provide a written statement to the district director having jurisdiction over the trust's return setting forth the reasons for failing to make the necessary change within the required time period. If the district director determines that the failure was due to reasonable cause, the district director may grant the trust an extension of time to make the necessary change. Whether an extension of time is granted is in the sole discretion of the district director and, if granted, may contain such terms with respect to assessment as may be necessary to ensure that the correct amount of tax will be collected from the trust, its owners, and its beneficiaries. If the district director does not grant an extension, the trust's residency changes as of the date of the inadvertent change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A trust that satisfies the court test has three fiduciaries, A, B, and C. A and B are United States citizens and C is a nonresident alien. All decisions of the trust are made by majority vote of the fiduciaries. The trust instrument provides that upon the death or resignation of any of the fiduciaries, D, is the successor fiduciary. A dies and D automatically becomes a fiduciary of the trust. When D becomes a fiduciary of the trust, D is a nonresident alien. Two months after A dies, B replaces D with E, a United States person. Because D was replaced with E within 12 months after the date of A's death, during the period after A's death and before E begins to serve, the trust satisfies the control test and remains a domestic trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that at the end of the 12-month period after A's death, D has not been replaced and remains a fiduciary of the trust. The trust becomes a foreign trust on the date A died unless the district director grants an extension of the time period to make the necessary change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Automatic migration provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, United States persons are not considered to control all substantial decisions of the trust if an attempt by any governmental agency or creditor to collect information from or assert a claim against the trust would cause one or more substantial decisions of the trust to no longer be controlled by United States persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a nonresident alien individual, is the grantor and, during A's lifetime, the sole beneficiary of a trust that qualifies as an individual retirement account (IRA). A has the exclusive power to make decisions regarding withdrawals from the IRA and to direct its investments. The IRA's sole trustee is a United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30). The control test is satisfied with respect to this trust because the special rule of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A, a nonresident alien individual, is the grantor of a trust and has the power to revoke the trust, in whole or in part, and revest assets in A. A is treated as the owner of the trust under sections 672(f) and 676. A is not a fiduciary of the trust. The trust has one trustee, B, a United States person, and the trust has one beneficiary, C. B has the discretion to distribute corpus or income to C. In this case, decisions exercisable by A to have trust assets distributed to A are substantial decisions. Therefore, the trust is a foreign trust because B does not control all substantial decisions of the trust.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A trust, Trust T, has two fiduciaries, A and B. Both A and B are United States persons. A and B hire C, an investment advisor who is a foreign person, and may terminate C's employment at will. The investment advisor makes the investment decisions for the trust. A and B control all other decisions of the trust. Although C has the power to make investment decisions, A and B are treated as controlling these decisions. Therefore, the control test is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. G, a United States citizen, creates a trust. The trust provides for income to A and B for life, remainder to A's and B's descendants. A is a nonresident alien and B is a United States person. The trustee of the trust is a United States person. The trust instrument authorizes A to replace the trustee. The power to replace the trustee is a substantial decision. Because A, a nonresident alien, controls a substantial decision, the control test is not satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date--(1) General rule. Except for the election to remain a domestic trust provided in paragraph (f) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, this section is applicable to taxable years ending after February 2, 1999. This section may be relied on by trusts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996, and also may be relied on by trusts whose trustees have elected to apply sections 7701(a)(30) and (31) to the trusts for taxable years ending after August 20, 1996, under section 1907(a)(3)(B) of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, (the SBJP Act) Public Law 104-188, 110 Stat. 1755 (26 U.S.C. 7701 note).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except for the election to remain a domestic trust provided in paragraph (f) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, this section is applicable to taxable years ending after February 2, 1999.

If a trust is created after August 19, 1996, and before April 5, 1999, and the trust satisfies the control test set forth in the regulations project REG-251703-96 published under section 7701(a)(30) and (31) (1997-1 C.B. 795) (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), but does not satisfy the control test set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, the trust may be modified to satisfy the control test of paragraph (d) by December 31, 1999. If the modification is completed by December 31, 1999, the trust will be treated as satisfying the control test of paragraph (d) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996, (and for taxable years ending after August 20, 1996, if the election under section 1907(a)(3)(B) of the SBJP Act has been made for the trust).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date of safe harbor for certain employee benefit trusts and investment trusts.

A trust that was in existence on August 20, 1996, and that was treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, may elect to continue treatment as a domestic trust notwithstanding section 7701(a)(30)(E). This election is not available to a trust that was wholly-owned by its grantor under subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, of the Code on August 20, 1996. The election is available to a trust if only a portion of the trust was treated as owned by the grantor under subpart E on August 20, 1996. If a partially-owned grantor trust makes the election, the election is effective for the entire trust. Also, a trust may not make the

A trust that was in existence on August 20, 1996, and that was treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, may elect to continue treatment as a domestic trust notwithstanding section 7701(a)(30)(E).

election if the trust has made an election pursuant to section 1907(a)(3)(B) of the SBJP Act to apply the new trust criteria to the first taxable year of the trust ending after August 20, 1996, because that election, once made, is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determining whether a trust was treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996--(i) Trusts filing Form 1041 for the taxable year that includes August 19, 1996. For purposes of the election, a trust is considered to have been treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, if: the trustee filed a Form 1041, ``U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts,'' for the trust for the period that includes August 19, 1996 (and did not file a Form 1040NR, ``U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,'' for that year); and the trust had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under section 7701(a)(30) prior to amendment by the SBJP Act (prior law) for reporting as a domestic trust for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Trusts filing Form 1041 for the taxable year that includes August 19, 1996. For purposes of the election, a trust is considered to have been treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, if: the trustee filed a Form 1041, ``U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts,'' for the trust for the period that includes August 19, 1996 (and did not file a Form 1040NR, ``U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,'' for that year); and the trust had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under section 7701(a)(30) prior to amendment by the SBJP Act (prior law) for reporting as a domestic trust for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trusts not filing a Form 1041. Some domestic trusts are not required to file Form 1041. For example, certain group trusts described in Rev. Rul. 81-100 (1981-1 C.B. 326) (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) consisting of trusts that are parts of qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts are not required to file Form 1041. Also, a domestic trust whose gross income for the taxable year is less than the amount required for filing an income tax return and that has no taxable income is not required to file a Form 1041. Section 6012(a)(4). For purposes of the election, a trust that filed neither a Form 1041 nor a Form 1040NR for the period that includes August 19, 1996, will be considered to have been treated as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996, if the trust had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under prior law for being treated as a domestic trust for that period and for filing neither a Form 1041 nor a Form 1040NR for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedure for making the election to remain domestic--(i) Required Statement. To make the election, a statement must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in the manner and time described in this section. The statement must be entitled ``Election to Remain a Domestic Trust under Section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,'' be signed under penalties of perjury by at least one trustee of the trust, and contain the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required Statement. To make the election, a statement must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in the manner and time described in this section. The statement must be entitled ``Election to Remain a Domestic Trust under Section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,'' be signed under penalties of perjury by at least one trustee of the trust, and contain the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement that the trust is electing to continue to be treated as a domestic trust under section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement that the trustee had a reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) under prior law for treating the trust as a domestic trust on August 19, 1996. (The trustee need not explain the reasonable basis on the election statement.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A statement either that the trust filed a Form 1041 treating the trust as a domestic trust for the period that includes August 19, 1996, (and that the trust did not file a Form 1040NR for that period), or that the trust was not required to file a Form 1041 or a Form 1040NR for the period that includes August 19, 1996, with an accompanying brief explanation as to why a Form 1041 was not required to be filed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The name, address, and employer identification number of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Filing the required statement with the Internal Revenue Service. (A) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(E) through (G) of this section, the trust must attach the statement to a Form 1041. The statement may be attached to either the Form 1041 that is filed for the first taxable year of the trust beginning after December 31, 1996 (1997 taxable year), or to the Form 1041 filed for the first taxable year of the trust beginning after December 31, 1997 (1998 taxable year). The statement, however, must be filed no later than the due date for filing a Form 1041 for the 1998 taxable year, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated. If the trust filed a Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year without the statement attached, the statement should be attached to the Form 1041 filed for the 1998 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(E) through (G) of this section, the trust must attach the statement to a Form 1041. The statement may be attached to either the Form 1041 that is filed for the first taxable year of the trust beginning after December 31, 1996 (1997 taxable year), or to the Form 1041 filed for the first taxable year of the trust beginning after December 31, 1997 (1998 taxable year). The statement, however, must be filed no later than the due date for filing a Form 1041 for the 1998 taxable year, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated. If the trust filed a Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year without the statement attached, the statement should be attached to the Form 1041 filed for the 1998 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the trust has insufficient gross income and no taxable income for its 1997 or 1998 taxable year, or both, and therefore is not required to file a Form 1041 for either or both years, the trust must make the election by filing a

Form 1041 for either the 1997 or 1998 taxable year with the statement attached (even though not otherwise required to file a Form 1041 for that year). The trust should only provide on the Form 1041 the trust's name, name and title of fiduciary, address, employer identification number, date created, and type of entity. The statement must be attached to a Form 1041 that is filed no later than October 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the trust files a Form 1040NR for the 1997 taxable year based on application of new section 7701(a)(30)(E) to the trust, and satisfies paragraph (f)(1) of this section, in order for the trust to make the election the trust must file an amended Form 1040NR return for the 1997 taxable year. The trust must note on the amended Form 1040NR that it is making an election under section 1161 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The trust must attach to the amended Form 1040NR the statement required by paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section and a completed Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year. The items of income, deduction and credit of the trust must be excluded from the amended Form 1040NR and reported on the Form 1041. The amended Form 1040NR for the 1997 taxable year, with the statement and the Form 1041 attached, must be filed with the Philadelphia Service Center no later than the due date, plus extensions, for filing a Form 1041 for the 1998 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If a trust has made estimated tax payments as a foreign trust based on application of section 7701(a)(30)(E) to the trust, but has not yet filed a Form 1040NR for the 1997 taxable year, when the trust files its Form 1041 for the 1997 taxable year it must note on its Form 1041 that it made estimated tax payments based on treatment as a foreign trust. The Form 1041 must be filed with the Philadelphia Service Center (and not with the service center where the trust ordinarily would file its Form 1041).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If a trust forms part of a qualified stock bonus, pension, or profit sharing plan, the election provided by this paragraph (f) must be made by attaching the statement to the plan's annual return required under section 6058 (information return) for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1996, or to the plan's information return for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1997. The statement must be attached to the plan's information return that is filed no later than the due date for filing the plan's information return for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1997, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1996, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Any other type of trust that is not required to file a Form 1041 for the taxable year, but that is required to file an information return (for example, Form 5227) for the 1997 or 1998 taxable year must attach the statement to the trust's information return for the 1997 or 1998 taxable year. However, the statement must be attached to an information return that is filed no later than the due date for filing the trust's information return for the 1998 taxable year, plus extensions. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A group trust described in Rev. Rul. 81-100 consisting of trusts that are parts of qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (and any other trust that is not described above and that is not required to file a Form 1041 or an information return) need not attach the statement to any return and should file the statement with the Philadelphia Service Center. The trust must make the election provided by this paragraph (f) by filing the statement by October 15, 1999. The election will be effective for the 1997 taxable year, and thereafter, until revoked or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to file the statement in the required manner and time. If a trust fails to file the statement in the manner or time provided in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the trustee may provide a written statement to the district director having jurisdiction over the trust setting forth the reasons for failing to file the statement in the required manner or time. If the district director determines that the failure to file the statement in the required manner or time was due to reasonable cause, the district director may grant the trust an extension of time to file

the statement. Whether an extension of time is granted shall be in the sole discretion of the district director. However, the relief provided by this paragraph (f)(3)(iii) is not ordinarily available if the statute of limitations for the trust's 1997 taxable year has expired. Additionally, if the district director grants an extension of time, it may contain terms with respect to assessment as may be necessary to ensure that the correct amount of tax will be collected from the trust, its owners, and its beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Revocation or termination of the election--(i) Revocation of election. The election provided by this paragraph (f) to be treated as a domestic trust may only be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. See sections 684, 6048, and 6677 for the federal tax consequences and reporting requirements related to the change in trust residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Revocation of election. The election provided by this paragraph (f) to be treated as a domestic trust may only be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. See sections 684, 6048, and 6677 for the federal tax consequences and reporting requirements related to the change in trust residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Termination of the election. An election under this paragraph (f) to remain a domestic trust terminates if changes are made to the trust subsequent to the effective date of the election that result in the trust no longer having any reasonable basis (within the meaning of section 6662) for being treated as a domestic trust under section 7701(a)(30) prior to its amendment by the SBJP Act. The termination of the election will result in the trust changing its residency from a domestic trust to a foreign trust on the effective date of the termination of the election. See sections 684, 6048, and 6677 for the federal tax consequences and reporting requirements related to the change in trust residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (f) is applicable beginning on February 2, 1999.
