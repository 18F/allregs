                            <p class="depth0">Each method of release detection for piping used to meet the requirements of Sec.  280.41 must be conducted in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Automatic line leak detectors. Methods which alert the operator to the presence of a leak by restricting or shutting off the flow of regulated substances through piping or triggering an audible or visual alarm may be used only if they detect leaks of 3 gallons per hour at 10 pounds per square inch line pressure within 1 hour. An annual test of the operation of the leak detector must be conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Line tightness testing. A periodic test of piping may be conducted only if it can detect a 0.1 gallon per hour leak rate at one and one-half times the operating pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicable tank methods. Any of the methods in Sec.  280.43 (e) through (h) may be used if they are designed to detect a release from any portion of the underground piping that routinely contains regulated substances.</p>
