A petition to reopen the hearing  for the purpose of taking additional evidence may be filed at any time  prior to the issuance of the final order. Every such petition shall  state briefly the nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced,  shall show that such evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set  forth a good reason why such evidence was not adduced at the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Petitions to rehear or reargue proceedings, or to reconsider  orders. A petition to rehear or reargue the proceeding or to reconsider  the final order shall be filed within 15 days after the date of the  service of such order. Every such petition shall state specifically the  matters claimed to have been erroneously decided, and alleged errors  must be briefly stated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for disposition of petitions. Within 10 days following  the service of any petition provided for in this section, the other  party to the proceeding shall file with the hearing clerk an answer  thereto. As soon as practicable thereafter, the Secretary shall announce  the decision granting or denying the petition. Unless the Secretary  shall determine otherwise, the issuance or operation of the order shall  not be stayed pending the decision of the Secretary upon the petition.  In the event that any such petition is granted by the Secretary, the  applicable rules of practice, as set out elsewhere in this subpart,  shall be followed.
