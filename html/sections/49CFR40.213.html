You must be knowledgeable about the alcohol  testing procedures in this part and the current DOT guidance. These  documents and information are available from ODAPC (Department of  Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington DC, 20590, 202- 366-3784, or on the ODAPC web site, http://www.dot.gov/ost/dapc)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Qualification training must be in accordance with the DOT Model  BAT or STT Course, as applicable. The DOT Model Courses are available  from ODAPC (Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE.,  Washington DC, 20590, 202-366-3784, or on the ODAPC web site, http:// www.dot.gov/ost/dapc). The training can also be provided using a course  of instruction equivalent to the DOT Model Courses. On request, ODAPC  will review BAT and STT instruction courses for equivalency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualification training must include training to proficiency in  using the alcohol testing procedures of this part and in the operation  of the particular alcohol testing device(s) (i.e., the ASD(s) or EBT(s))  you will be using.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The training must emphasize that you are responsible for  maintaining the integrity of the testing process, ensuring the privacy  of employees being tested, and avoiding conduct or statements that could  be viewed as offensive or inappropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The instructor must be an individual who has demonstrated  necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities by regularly conducting DOT  alcohol tests as an STT or BAT, as applicable, for a period of at least  a year, who has conducted STT or BAT training, as applicable, under this  part for a year, or who has successfully completed a ``train the  trainer'' course.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial Proficiency Demonstration. Following your completion of  qualification training under paragraph (b) of this section, you must  demonstrate proficiency in alcohol testing under this part by completing  seven consecutive error-free mock tests (BATs) or five consecutive  error-free tests (STTs).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Another person must monitor and evaluate your performance, in  person or by a means that provides real-time observation and interaction  between the instructor and trainee, and attest in writing that the mock  collections are ``error-free.'' This person must be an individual who  meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> These tests must use the alcohol testing devices (e.g., EBT(s)  or ASD(s)) that you will use as a BAT or STT.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you are an STT who will be using an ASD that indicates  readings by changes, contrasts, or other readings in color, you must  demonstrate as part of the mock test that you are able to discern  changes, contrasts, or readings correctly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Schedule for qualification training and initial proficiency  demonstration.   The following is the schedule for qualification training and the initial  proficiency demonstration you must meet:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you became a BAT or STT before August 1, 2001, you were  required to have met the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and  (c) of this section, and you do not have to meet them again.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you become a BAT or STT on or after August 1, 2001, you must  meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section before  you begin to perform BAT or STT functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refresher training. No less frequently than every five years  from the date on which you satisfactorily complete the requirements of  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, you must complete refresher  training that meets all the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section. If you are a BAT or STT who completed qualification  training before January 1, 1998, you are not required to complete  refresher training until January 1, 2003.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Error Correction Training. If you make a mistake in the alcohol  testing process that causes a test to be cancelled (i.e., a fatal or  uncorrected flaw), you must undergo error correction training. This  training must occur within 30 days of the date you are notified of the  error that led to the need for retraining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Error correction training must be provided and your proficiency  documented in writing by a person who meets the requirements of  paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Error correction training is required to cover only the subject  matter area(s) in which the error that caused the test to be cancelled  occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As part of the error correction training, you must demonstrate  your proficiency in the alcohol testing procedures of this part by  completing three consecutive error-free mock tests. The mock tests must  include one uneventful scenario and two scenarios related to the area(s)  in which your error(s) occurred. The person providing the training must  monitor and evaluate your performance and attest in writing that the  mock tests were error-free.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Documentation. You must maintain documentation showing that you  currently meet all requirements of this section. You must provide this  documentation on request to DOT agency representatives and to employers  and C/TPAs who are negotiating to use your services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Other persons who may serve as BATs or STTs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Anyone meeting  the requirements of this section to be a BAT may act as an STT, provided  that the individual has demonstrated initial proficiency in the  operation of the ASD that he or she is using, as provided in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Law enforcement officers who have been certified by state or  local governments to conduct breath alcohol testing are deemed to be  qualified as BATs. They are not required to also complete the training  requirements of this section in order to act as BATs. In order for a  test conducted by such an officer to be accepted under DOT alcohol  testing requirements, the officer must have been certified by a state or  local government to use the EBT or ASD that was used for the test.
