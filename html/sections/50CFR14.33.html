Sec.  13.11 and 13.12 of this subchapter, and in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section, issue a permit authorizing importation or exportation of wildlife in order to alleviate undue economic hardship at one or more named Customs port(s) of entry not otherwise authorized by subpart B. Such permits may authorize a single importation or exportation, a series of importations or exportations, or importation or exportation during a specified period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application procedure. Applications for permits to import or export wildlife at a nondesignated port to alleviate undue economic hardship must be submitted to the Director. Each application must contain the general information and certification required in Sec.  13.12(a) of this subchapter, plus the following additional information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number and kinds of wildlife described by scientific and common names to be imported or exported, where such number and kinds can be determined, and a description of the form in which it is to be imported, such as ``live,'' ``frozen,'' ``raw hides,'' or a full description of any manufactured product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The country or place in which the wildlife was removed from the wild (if known), or where born in captivity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name and address of the supplier or consignee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The port(s) of entry where importation or exportation is requested, and the reasons why importation or exportation should be allowed at the requested port(s) of entry rather than at a designated port (information must be included to show the monetary difference between the cost of importation or exportation at the port requested and the lowest cost of importation or exportation at the port through which importation or exportation is authorized by subpart B without a permit); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement as to whether the exception is being requested for a single shipment, a series of shipments, or shipments over a specified period of time and the date(s) involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits to import or export wildlife at a nondesignated port issued under this section are subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Permittee shall file such reports as specified on the permit, if any; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permittee must pay fees in accordance with Sec.  14.94.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance criteria. The Director shall consider the following in determining whether to issue a permit under this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The difference between the cost of importing or exporting the wildlife at the port requested and the lowest cost of importing or exporting such wildlife at a port authorized by these regulations without a permit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The severity of the economic hardship that likely would result should the permit not be issued;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The kind of wildlife involved, including its form and place of origin; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Availability of a Service officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duration of permits. Any permit issued under this section expires on the date designated on the face of the permit. In no case will the permit be valid for more than 2 years from the date of issuance.
