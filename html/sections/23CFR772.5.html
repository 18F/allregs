                            <p class="depth0">Benefited receptor. The recipient of an abatement measure that  receives a noise reduction at or above the minimum threshold of 5 dB(A),  but not to exceed the highway agency's reasonableness design goal.</p><p class="depth0">Common Noise Environment. A group of receptors within the same  Activity Category in Table 1 that are exposed to similar noise sources  and levels; traffic volumes, traffic mix, and speed; and topographic  features. Generally, common noise environments occur between two  secondary noise sources, such as interchanges, intersections, cross- roads.</p><p class="depth0">Date of public knowledge. The date of approval of the Categorical  Exclusion (CE), the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or the  Record of Decision (ROD), as defined in 23 CFR part 771.</p><p class="depth0">Design year. The future year used to estimate the probable traffic  volume for which a highway is designed.</p><p class="depth0">Existing noise levels. The worst noise hour resulting from the  combination of natural and mechanical sources and human activity usually  present in a particular area.</p><p class="depth0">Feasibility. The combination of acoustical and engineering factors  considered in the evaluation of a noise abatement measure.</p><p class="depth0">Impacted Receptor. The recipient that has a traffic noise impact.</p><p class="depth0">L10. The sound level that is exceeded 10 percent of the time (the  90th percentile) for the period under consideration, with L10(h) being  the hourly value of L10.</p><p class="depth0">Leq. The equivalent steady-state sound level which in a stated  period of time contains the same acoustic energy as the time-varying  sound level during the same time period, with Leq(h) being the hourly  value of Leq.</p><p class="depth0">Multifamily dwelling. A residential structure containing more than  one residence. Each residence in a multifamily dwelling shall be counted  as one receptor when determining impacted and benefited receptors.</p><p class="depth0">Noise barrier. A physical obstruction that is constructed between  the highway noise source and the noise sensitive receptor(s) that lowers  the noise level, including stand alone noise walls, noise berms (earth  or other material), and combination berm/wall systems.</p><p class="depth0">Noise reduction design goal. The optimum desired dB(A) noise  reduction determined from calculating the difference between future  build noise levels with abatement, to future build noise levels without  abatement. The noise reduction design goal shall be at least 7 dB(A),  but not more than 10 dB(A).</p><p class="depth0">Permitted. A definite commitment to develop land with an approved  specific design of land use activities as evidenced by the issuance of a  building permit.</p><p class="depth0">Property owner. An individual or group of individuals that holds a  title, deed, or other legal documentation of ownership of a property or  a residence.</p><p class="depth0">Reasonableness. The combination of social, economic, and  environmental factors considered in the evaluation of a noise abatement  measure.</p><p class="depth0">Receptor. A discrete or representative location of a noise sensitive  area(s), for any of the land uses listed in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">Residence. A dwelling unit. Either a single family residence or each  dwelling unit in a multifamily dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">Statement of likelihood. A statement provided in the environmental  clearance document based on the feasibility and reasonableness analysis  completed   at the time the environmental document is being approved.</p><p class="depth0">Substantial construction. The granting of a building permit, prior  to right-of-way acquisition or construction approval for the highway.</p><p class="depth0">Substantial noise increase. One of two types of highway traffic  noise impacts. For a Type I project, an increase in noise levels of 5 to  15 dB(A) in the design year over the existing noise level.</p><p class="depth0">Traffic noise impacts. Design year build condition noise levels that  approach or exceed the NAC listed in Table 1 for the future build  condition; or design year build condition noise levels that create a  substantial noise increase over existing noise levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The construction of a highway on new location;  or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The physical alteration of an existing highway where there is  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Substantial Horizontal Alteration. A project that halves the  distance between the traffic noise source and the closest receptor  between the existing condition to the future build condition; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial Vertical Alteration. A project that removes  shielding therefore exposing the line-of-sight between the receptor and  the traffic noise source. This is done by either altering the vertical  alignment of the highway or by altering the topography between the  highway traffic noise source and the receptor; or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> The addition of a through-traffic lane(s). This includes the  addition of a through-traffic lane that functions as a HOV lane, High- Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane, bus lane, or truck climbing lane; or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> The addition of an auxiliary lane, except for when the auxiliary  lane is a turn lane; or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> The addition or relocation of interchange lanes or ramps added  to a quadrant to complete an existing partial interchange; or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Restriping existing pavement for the purpose of adding a  through-traffic lane or an auxiliary lane; or,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> The addition of a new or substantial alteration of a weigh  station, rest stop, ride-share lot or toll plaza.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(8)</em> If a project is determined to be a Type I project under this  definition then the entire project area as defined in the environmental  document is a Type I project.</p><p class="depth2">Type II project. A Federal or Federal-aid highway project for noise  abatement on an existing highway. For a Type II project to be eligible  for Federal-aid funding, the highway agency must develop and implement a  Type II program in accordance with section 772.7(e).</p><p class="depth2">Type III project. A Federal or Federal-aid highway project that does  not meet the classifications of a Type I or Type II project. Type III  projects do not require a noise analysis.</p>
