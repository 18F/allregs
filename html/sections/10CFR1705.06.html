This appeal should be  directed to The Chairman, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, 625  Indiana Avenue NW., suite 700, Washington, DC 20004. The appeal letter  must (a) specify those denied records which are still sought, and (b)  state why the denial by the Privacy Act Officer is erroneous. The  Chairman or his designee will respond to such appeals within twenty  working days after the appeal letter has been received in the Board's  offices. The appeal determination will explain the basis for continuing  to deny access to any requested records.</p>
