DOE will conduct a total system performance assessment to evaluate the ability of the geologic repository to meet the applicable radiation protection standard under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOE will conduct a total system performance assessment to evaluate the ability of the Yucca Mountain disposal system to limit radiological doses and radionuclide concentrations in the case where there is no human intrusion into the repository. DOE will model the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system using the method described in paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria in Sec. 963.17. DOE will consider the performance of the system in terms of the criteria to evaluate whether the Yucca Mountain disposal system is likely to comply with the applicable radiation protection standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOE will conduct a separate total system performance assessment to evaluate the ability of the Yucca Mountain disposal system to limit radiological doses in the case where there is a human intrusion as specified by 10 CFR 63.322. DOE will model the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system using the method described in paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria in Sec. 963.17. If required by applicable NRC regulations regarding a human intrusion standard, Sec. 63.321, DOE will consider the performance of the system in terms of the criteria to evaluate whether the Yucca Mountain disposal system is likely to comply with the applicable radiation protection standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In conducting a total system performance assessment under this section, DOE will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include data related to the suitability criteria in Sec. 963.17;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Account for uncertainties and variabilities in parameter values and provide the technical basis for parameter ranges, probability distributions, and bounding values;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Consider alternative models of features and processes that are consistent with available data and current scientific understanding, and evaluate the effects that alternative models would have on the estimated performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system ;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consider only events that have at least one chance in 10,000 of occurring over 10,000 years;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of specific features, events, and processes of the geologic setting, including appropriate details as to magnitude and timing regarding any exclusions that would significantly change the dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of degradation, deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers, including those processes that would adversely

affect natural barriers, (such as degradation of concrete liners affecting the pH of ground water or precipitation of minerals due to heat changing hydrologic processes), including appropriate details as to magnitude and timing regarding any exclusions that would significantly change the dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide the technical basis for models used in the total system performance assessment such as comparisons made with outputs of detailed process-level models and/or empirical observations (for example, laboratory testing, field investigations, and natural analogs);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Identify natural features of the geologic setting and design features of the engineered barrier system important to isolating radioactive waste;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Describe the capability of the natural and engineered barriers important to isolating radioactive waste, taking into account uncertainties in characterizing and modeling such barriers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Provide the technical basis for the description of the capability of the natural and engineered barriers important to isolating radioactive waste;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Use the reference biosphere and reasonably maximally exposed individual assumptions specified in applicable NRC regulations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Conduct appropriate sensitivity studies.</p>
