                            <p class="depth0">Project water may be delivered to headgates only as provided in Sec. Sec. 418.8 and 418.10. Water delivered to lands that are not entitled to be irrigated or not in accord with decreed water duties is difficult to quantify at best because it is not typically measured. Since it is not likely to be a part of the total actual headgate deliveries, yet is a part of the total deliveries to the Project, it will manifest itself directly as a lower efficiency. Thus, it will either reduce the District's incentive credit or increase the storage debit by the amount improperly diverted. All other users outside the Project are thereby held harmless but the District incurs the consequence. This approach should eliminate any potential disputes between the District and the Bureau regarding the quantity of water misappropriated.</p>
