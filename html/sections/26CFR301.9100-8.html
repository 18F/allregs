Sec. 301.9100-14T  Individual's election to terminate taxable year when case commences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The regulations prescribed in this section provide rules for making the election under section 1398(d)(2) to terminate the taxable year of an individual taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Availability of election. This election is available to an individual taxpayer in a case commenced after March 24, 1981, under chapter 7 (relating to liquidations) or chapter 11 (relating to reorganizations) of title 11 of the United States Code. If the case is dismissed, the taxpayer cannot make the election, and an election previously made will be void. For purposes of this section, a partnership is not treated as an individual. If the taxpayer making the election is married (within the meaning of section 143), the election is available to the taxpayer's spouse, but only if the spouse is eligible to file, and does file, a joint return with the taxpayer for the taxable year ended as a result of the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect of election. The election terminates the taxable year of the taxpayer (and of a spouse who joins in the election) on the day before the commencement date of the case. A new taxable year begins on the commencement date and (unless terminated earlier) ends on the date on which the taxpayer's taxable year in which the case commenced would have ended if the election had not been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time and manner. A taxpayer to whom the election is available makes the election by filing a return for the short taxable year ending the day before commencement of the case (the ``first short taxable year'') on or before the 15th day of the fourth full month following the end of that first short taxable year. The spouse of such a taxpayer makes the election by making a

joint return with the taxpayer for that first short taxable year within the time prescribed in the preceding sentence. To facilitate processing, the taxpayer should write ``Section 1398 Election'' at the top of the return. A taxpayer may also make the election by attaching a statement of election to an application for extension of time for filing a return that satisfies the requirements under section 6081 for the first short taxable year. The application for extension must be submitted under section 6081 on or before the due date of the return for the first short taxable year. The statement must state that the taxpayer elects under section 1398(d)(2) to close his or her taxable year as of the day before commencement of the case. If the taxpayer's spouse elects to close his or her taxable year, the spouse must join in the application for extension and in the statement of election. If a joint return is not filed for the first short taxable year, the election of the spouse made with the application is void.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Irrevocability of election. The election is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Subsequent bankruptcy case of debtor's spouse. If a case under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code commences with respect to the spouse of a debtor to whom an election under this section was available, the spouse can make an election under this section even if the spouse's case commences in the same taxable year in which the debtor's case commences. The spouse can make the election whether or not the spouse previously joined in the debtor's election. If the spouse joined in the debtor's election, or if the debtor did not make the election, the debtor may join in the spouse's election, assuming the debtor is otherwise eligible to file a joint return with the spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assume that husband and wife are calendar-year taxpayers, that a bankruptcy case involving only the husband commences on March 1, 1982, and that a bankruptcy case involving only the wife commences on October 10, 1982.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the husband does not make an election, his taxable year would not be affected; i.e., it does not terminate on February 28. If the husband does make an election, his first short taxable year would be January 1 through February 28; his second short taxable year would begin March 1. The tax return for his first short taxable year would be due on June 15. The wife could join in the husband's election, but only if they file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through February 28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The wife could elect to terminate her taxable year on October 9. If she did, and if the husband had not made an election or if the wife had not joined in the husband's election, she would have two taxable years in 1982--the first from January 1 through October 9, and the second from October 10 through December 31. The tax return for her first short taxable year would be due on February 15, 1983. If the husband had not made an election to terminate his taxable year on February 28, the husband could join in an election by his wife, but only if they file a joint return for the taxable year January 1 through October 9. If the husband had made an election but the wife had not joined in the husband's election, the husband could not join in an election by the wife to terminate her taxable year on October 9, since they could not file a joint return for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the wife makes the election relating to her own bankruptcy case, and had joined the husband in making an election relating to his case, she would have two additional taxable years with respect to her 1982 income and deductions--the second short taxable year would be March 1 through October 9, and the third short taxable year would be October 10 through December 31. The husband could join in the wife's election if they file a joint return for the second short taxable year. If the husband joins in the wife's election, they could file joint returns for the short taxable year ending December 31, but would not be required to do so.

This amendment, which applies to taxable years of electing small business corporations ending after April 14, 1966, provides, in general, that an election of a small business corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not terminate

for a taxable year of the corporation in which it has gross receipts more than 20 percent of which is passive investment income, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such taxable year is the first taxable year in which the corporation commenced the active conduct of any trade or business or the next succeeding taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of passive investment income for such taxable year is less than $3,000.
Section 3(b) of the Act of April 14, 1966, provides that the amendment made by section 3(a) thereof shall also apply to taxable years of a corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966, if the corporation elects to have the amendment apply to such years, and all persons (or their personal representatives) who were shareholders of such corporation at any time during any of such years consent to such election and the application of the amendment.

If an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code is not treated as terminated for a taxable year of the corporation as a result of an election and consents under this paragraph, such election under section 1372(a) of the Code shall be treated as being in effect with respect to all subsequent taxable years of the corporation unless it is otherwise terminated or revoked for any such subsequent year pursuant to section 1372(e) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Election by corporation.

Such election shall be filed within 3 years after the date prescribed by law (not including any extension thereof) on which such return was required to be filed, or within 90 days from February 28, 1967, whichever is later. (However, credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to the election may not be allowed or made if claim therefor has not been filed within the time prescribed by law; and, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph providing that the statutory period for assessment of certain deficiencies against shareholders may not have expired on the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed.) Such election shall be in the form of a statement, signed by a person authorized to sign the corporation's return of income, which shall expressly provide that the corporation elects the application of section 1372(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Pub. L. 89-389, with respect to its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966.

corporation; the internal revenue officer with whom the corporation's returns of income have been filed for each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; the names and addresses of all persons who have been shareholders of the corporation at any time during each of its taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962; computations showing the amount of the corporation's overpayment or deficiency of tax for any taxable year which is attributable to the election under this paragraph; and computations showing each shareholder's portion of the undistributed taxable income (determined as provided in section 1373(b) of the Code) or net operating loss (determined as provided in section 1374(c) of the Code) for each taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, unless such computations were made on the corporation's returns of income for each of such years.

An election by a corporation pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied by the consent of each person who was a shareholder of the corporation at any time during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, and ending before April 15, 1966. This includes persons who may not be shareholders on the date the election is filed. Where stock of the corporation was owned by a husband and wife as community property (or the income from which was community property), or was owned by tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety, each person who had a community interest in such stock and each tenant in common, joint tenant, and tenant by the entirety must consent to the election. The consent of a minor shall be made by the minor or by his legal guardian, or by his natural guardian if no legal guardian has been appointed. The consent of an estate shall be made by the executor or administrator thereof. If a person who is required to file a consent under this subparagraph is deceased, the executor or administrator of such person's estate, or other person charged with the property of such person, shall file the required consent. The consent of each shareholder shall be in the form of a statement signed by the shareholder in which he states that he consents to the election by the corporation under this paragraph. Each of such statements shall set forth the name and address of the corporation and of the shareholder; the number of shares of stock of the corporation owned by such shareholder at any time during any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962; the date (or dates) on which such stock was acquired, and, if disposed of, the date (or dates) of disposition; and the internal revenue officer with whom the shareholder's income tax returns have been filed for each of such taxable years in which he owned any such stock. In addition, a consent under this paragraph is not effective unless (i) the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for each taxable year for which there would be a deficiency attributable to the election and consents under this paragraph has not expired on the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed, and (ii) there is included in, or attached to, the statement of consent a written consent that the statutory period for assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year (to the extent that such deficiency is attributable to the election and consents under this paragraph) shall not expire before the expiration of 1 year after the date the election and consents under this paragraph are filed. Each of the statements of consent under this subparagraph shall be filed with the corporation's election under this paragraph. The consents of all shareholders may be incorporated in one statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Election and consents are binding. The election and consents under this paragraph are binding and may not be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> New shareholders. Section 1372(e)(1) of the Code provides that an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall terminate if certain new shareholders do not consent to such election within the time prescribed by regulations. New shareholders of a corporation which makes

an election under paragraph (b) of this section may not have consented to the corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code within such prescribed time as a result of a termination of such election under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 89-389. Therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, an election by a corporation under section 1372(a) of the Code shall not be treated as terminated for the failure of any new shareholder to file a timely consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code, for any of the taxable years of the corporation between and including the earliest taxable year determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and the taxable year during which the corporation files an election under paragraph (b) of this section, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The corporation's election under section 1372(a) of the Code would have terminated for a taxable year under section 1372(e)(5) of the Code in the event it had not made an election under paragraph (b) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A proper consent under section 1372(e)(1) of the Code is filed by such new shareholder with the corporation's election under paragraph (b) of this section.
