                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Office of Government Ethics provides, through the Federal  Supply Service of the General Services Administration (GSA), a standard  form, the SF 278 (Public Financial Disclosure Report), for reporting the  information described in subpart B of this part on executive branch  public disclosure. The Office of Government Ethics also provides two  uniform formats relating to confidential financial disclosure: OGE Form  450 (Confidential Financial Disclosure Report) for reporting the  information described in subpart I of this part on executive branch  confidential disclosure; and OGE Optional Form 450-A (Confidential  Certificate of No New Interests) for voluntary use by certain employees  in lieu of filing an annual OGE Form 450, if authorized by their agency,  in accordance with Sec. 2634.905(b) of subpart I of this part. Supplies  of the two confidential forms are to be reproduced locally by each  agency, from a camera-ready copy or an electronic format made available  by the Office of Government Ethics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject to the prior written approval of the Director of the  Office of Government Ethics, an agency may require employees to file  additional confidential financial disclosure forms which supplement  either or both of the standard forms referred to in paragraph (a) of  this section, if necessary because of special or unique agency  circumstances. The Director may approve such agency forms when, in his  opinion, the supplementation is shown to be necessary for a  comprehensive and effective agency ethics program to identify and  resolve conflicts of interest. See Secs. 2634.103 and 2634.901.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The information collection and recordkeeping requirements have  been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control  number 3209-0001 for the SF 278, and control number 3209-0006 for OGE  Form 450/SF 450. OGE Optional Form 450-A has been determined not to  require an OMB paperwork control number, as its use is strictly optional  for employees, it is used exclusively by current Government employees,  and it does not require affirmative disclosure of substantive  information.
