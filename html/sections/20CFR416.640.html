                                Sec. 416.640  Use of benefit payments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Current maintenance. We will consider that payments we certify to a representive payee have been used for the use and benefit of the beneficiary if they are used for the beneficiary's current maintenance. Current maintenance includes costs incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care and personal comfort items.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A Supplemental Security Income beneficiary is entitled to a monthly benefit of $264. The beneficiary's son, who is the representative payee, disburses the benefits in the following manner:
Rent and Utilities...............................................   $166Medical..........................................................     20Food.............................................................     60Clothing.........................................................     10Miscellaneous....................................................      8</p><p class="depth0">The above expenditures would represent proper disbursements on behalf of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Institution not receiving Medicaid funds on beneficiary's behalf. If a beneficiary is receiving care in a Federal, State, or private institution because of mental or physical incapacity, current maintenance will include the customary charges for the care and services provided by an institution, expenditures for those items which will aid in the beneficiary's recovery or release from the institution, and nominal expenses for personal needs (e.g., personal hygiene items, snacks, candy) which will improve the beneficiary's condition. Except as provided under Sec. 416.212, there is no restriction in using SSI benefits for a beneficiary's current maintenance in an institution. Any payments remaining from SSI benefits may be used for a temporary period to maintain the beneficiary's residence outside of the institution unless a physician has certified that the beneficiary is not likely to return home.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A hospitalized disabled beneficiary is entitled to a monthly benefit of $264. The beneficiary, who resides in a boarding home, has resided there for over 6 years. It is doubtful that the beneficiary will leave the boarding home in the near future. The boarding home charges $215 per month for the beneficiary's room and board.</p><p class="depth0">The beneficiary's representative payee pays the boarding home $215 (assuming an unsuccessful effort was made to negotiate a lower rate during the beneficiary's absence) and uses the balance to purchase miscellaneous personal items for the beneficiary. There are no benefits remaining which can be conserved on behalf of the beneficiary. The payee's use of the benefits is consistent with our guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Institution receiving Medicaid funds on beneficiary's behalf. Except in the case of a beneficiary receiving benefits payable under Sec. 416.212, if a beneficiary resides throughout a month in an institution that receives more than 50 percent of the cost of care on behalf of the beneficiary from Medicaid, any payments due shall be used only for the personal needs of the beneficiary and not for other items of current maintenance.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A disabled beneficiary resides in a hospital. The superintendent of the hospital receives $30 per month as the beneficiary's payee. The benefit payment is disbursed in the following manner, which would be consistent with our guidelines:
Miscellaneous canteen items........................................  $10Clothing...........................................................   15Conserved for future needs of the beneficiary......................    5</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Claims of creditors. A payee may not be required to use benefit payments to satisfy a debt of the beneficiary, if the debt arose prior to the first month for which payments are certified to a payee. If the debt arose prior to this time, a payee may satisfy it only if the current and reasonably foreseeable needs of the beneficiary are met.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A disabled beneficiary was determined to be eligible for a monthly benefit payment of $208 effective April 1981. The benefits were certified to the beneficiary's brother who was appointed as the representative payee. The payee conserved $27 of the benefits received. In June 1981 the payee received a bill from a doctor who had treated the beneficiary in February and March 1981. The bill was for $175.</p><p class="depth0">After reviewing the beneficiary's current needs and resources, the payee decided not to use any of the benefits to pay the doctor's bill. (Approximately $180 a month is required for the beneficiary's current monthly living expenses--rent, utilities, food, and insurance--and the beneficiary will need new shoes and a coat within the next few months.)</p><p class="depth0">Based upon the above, the payee's decision not to pay the doctor's bill is consistent with our guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Dedicated accounts for eligible individuals under age 18. (1) When past-due benefit payments are required to be paid into a separate dedicated account (see Sec. 416.546), the representative payee is required to establish in a financial institution an account dedicated to the purposes described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. This dedicated account may be a checking, savings or money market account subject to the titling requirements set forth in Sec. 416.645. Dedicated accounts may not be in the form of certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks, bonds or trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When past-due benefit payments are required to be paid into a separate dedicated account (see Sec. 416.546), the representative payee is required to establish in a financial institution an account dedicated to the purposes described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. This dedicated account may be a checking, savings or money market account subject to the titling requirements set forth in Sec. 416.645. Dedicated accounts may not be in the form of certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks, bonds or trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A representative payee shall use dedicated account funds, whether deposited on a mandatory or permissive basis (as described in Sec. 416.546), for the benefit of the child and only for the following allowable expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medical treatment and education or job skills training;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If related to the child's impairment(s), personal needs assistance; special equipment; housing modification; and therapy or rehabilitation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other items and services related to the child's impairment(s) that we determine to be appropriate. The representative payee must explain why or how the other item or service relates to the impairment(s) of the child. Attorney fees related to the pursuit of the child's disability claim and use of funds to prevent malnourishment or homelessness could be considered appropriate expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Representative payees must keep records and receipts of all deposits to and expenditures from dedicated accounts, and must submit these records to us upon our request, as explained in Secs. 416.635 and 416.665.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The use of funds from a dedicated account in any manner not authorized by this section constitutes a misapplication of benefits. These misapplied benefits are not an overpayment as defined in Sec. 416.537; however, if we determine that a representative payee knowingly misapplied funds in a dedicated account, that representative payee shall be liable to us in an amount equal to the total amount of the misapplied funds. In addition, if a

recipient who is his or her own payee knowingly misapplies benefits in a dedicated account, we will reduce future benefits payable to that recipient (or to that recipient and his or her spouse) by an amount equal to the total amount of the misapplied funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The restrictions described in this section and the income and resource exclusions described in Secs. 416.1124(c)(20) and 416.1247 shall continue to apply until all funds in the dedicated account are depleted or eligibility for benefits terminates, whichever comes first. This continuation of the restrictions and exclusions applies in situations where funds remain in the account in any of the following situations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A child attains age 18, continues to be eligible and receives payments directly;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A new representative payee is appointed. When funds remaining in a dedicated account are returned to us by the former representative payee, the new representative payee must establish an account in a financial institution into which we will deposit these funds, even if the amount is less than that prescribed in Sec. 416.546; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> During a period of suspension due to ineligibility as described in Sec. 416.1320, administrative suspension, or a period of eligibility for which no payment is due.

Sec. 416.640a  Compensation for qualified organizations serving as representative payees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Organizations that can request compensation. A qualified organization can request us to authorize it to collect a monthly fee from your benefit payment. A qualified organization is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any State or local government agency with fiduciary responsibilities or whose mission is to carry out income maintenance, social service, or health care-related activities; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any community-based nonprofit social service organization founded for religious, charitable or social welfare purposes, which is tax exempt under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and which is bonded/insured to cover misuse and embezzlement by officers and employees and which is licensed in each State in which it serves as representative payee (if licensing is available in the State). The minimum amount of bonding or insurance coverage must equal the average monthly amount of supplemental security income payments received by the organization plus the amount of the beneficiaries' conserved funds (i.e., beneficiaries' saved supplemental security income payments) plus interest on hand. For example, an organization that has conserved funds of $5,000 and receives an average of $12,000 a month in supplemental security income payments must be bonded/insured for a minimum of $17,000. The license must be appropriate under the laws of the State for the type of services the organization provides. An example of an appropriately licensed organization is a community mental health center holding a State license to provide community mental health services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements qualified organizations must meet. Organizations that are qualified under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section must also meet the following requirements before we can authorize them to collect a monthly fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A qualified organization must regularly provide representative payee services concurrently to at least five beneficiaries. An organization which has received our authorization to collect a fee for representative payee services, but is temporarily (not more than 6 months) not a payee for at least five beneficiaries, may request our approval to continue to collect fees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A qualified organization must demonstrate that it is not a creditor of the beneficiary. See paragraph (c) of this section for exceptions to the requirement regarding creditors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Creditor relationship. On a case-by-case basis, we may authorize an organization to collect a fee for payee services despite the creditor relationship. (For example, the creditor is the beneficiary's landlord.) To provide this authorization, we will review all of the evidence submitted by the organization and authorize collection of a fee when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The creditor services (e.g., providing housing) provided by the organization help to meet the current needs of the beneficiary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount the organization charges the beneficiary for these services is commensurate with the beneficiary's ability to pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Authorization process. (1) An organization must request in writing and receive an authorization from us before it may collect a fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An organization must request in writing and receive an authorization from us before it may collect a fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An organization seeking authorization to collect a fee must also give us evidence to show that it is qualified, pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, to collect a fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the evidence provided to us by the organization shows that it meets the requirements of this section, and additional investigation by us proves it suitable to serve, we will notify the organization in writing that it is authorized to collect a fee. If we need more evidence, or if we are not able to authorize the collection of a fee, we will also notify the organization in writing that we have not authorized the collection of a fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Revocation and cancellation of the authorization. (1) We will revoke an authorization to collect a fee if we have evidence which establishes that an organization no longer meets the requirements of this section. We will issue a written notice to the organization explaining the reason(s) for the revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We will revoke an authorization to collect a fee if we have evidence which establishes that an organization no longer meets the requirements of this section. We will issue a written notice to the organization explaining the reason(s) for the revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An organization may cancel its authorization at any time upon written notice to us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notices. The written notice we will send to an organization authorizing the collection of a fee will contain an effective date for the collection of a fee pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section. The effective date will be no earlier than the month in which the organization asked for authorization to collect a fee. The notice will be applicable to all beneficiaries for whom the organization was payee at the time of our authorization and all beneficiaries for whom the organization becomes payee while the authorization is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Limitation on fees. (1) An organization authorized to collect a fee under this section may collect from a beneficiary a monthly fee for expenses (including overhead) it has incurred in providing payee services to a beneficiary. The limit on the fee a qualified organization may collect for providing payee services increases by the same percentage as the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA). The increased fee amount (rounded to the nearest dollar) is taken beginning with the payment for January.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An organization authorized to collect a fee under this section may collect from a beneficiary a monthly fee for expenses (including overhead) it has incurred in providing payee services to a beneficiary. The limit on the fee a qualified organization may collect for providing payee services increases by the same percentage as the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA). The increased fee amount (rounded to the nearest dollar) is taken beginning with the payment for January.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any agreement providing for a fee in excess of the amount permitted shall be void and treated as misuse of your benefits by the organization under Sec. 416.641.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A fee may be collected for any month during which the organization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provides representative payee services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Receives a benefit payment for the beneficiary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is authorized to receive a fee for representative payee services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fees for services may not be taken from any funds conserved for the beneficiary by a payee in accordance with Sec. 416.645.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Generally, an organization may not collect a fee for months in which it does not receive a benefit payment. However, an organization will be allowed to collect a fee for months in which it did not receive a payment if we later issue payment for these months and the organization:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Received our approval to collect a fee for the months for which payment is made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provided payee services in the months for which payment is made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Was the payee when the retroactive payment was paid by us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fees for services may not be taken from beneficiary benefits for the months for which we or a court of competent jurisdiction determine(s) that the representative payee misused benefits. Any fees collected for such months will be treated as a part of the beneficiary's misused benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> An authorized organization can collect a fee for providing representative payee services from another source if the total amount of the fee collected from both the beneficiary and the

other source does not exceed the amount authorized by us.
