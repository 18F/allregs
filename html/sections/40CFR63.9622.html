                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For wet scrubbers subject to performance testing in Sec. 63.9620 and operating limits for pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate in Sec. 63.9590(b)(1), you must establish site-specific operating limits according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Using the CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631(b), measure and record the pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate every 15 minutes during each run of the particulate matter performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate and record the average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate for each individual test run. Your operating limits are established as the lowest average pressure drop and the lowest average scrubber water flow rate corresponding to any of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a rod-deck venturi scrubber is applied to an indurating furnace to meet any particulate matter emission

limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you may establish a lower average pressure drop operating limit by using historical average pressure drop data from a certified performance test completed on or after December 18, 2002 instead of using the average pressure drop value determined during the initial performance test, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If historical average pressure drop data are used to establish an operating limit (i.e., using data from a certified performance test conducted prior to the promulgation date of the final rule), then the average particulate matter concentration corresponding to the historical performance test must be at or below the applicable indurating furnace emission limit, as listed in Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For dynamic wet scrubbers subject to performance testing in Sec. 63.9620 and operating limits for scrubber water flow rate and either fan amperage or pressure drop in Sec. 63.9590(b)(2), you must establish site-specific operating limits according to the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Using the CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631(b), measure and record the scrubber water flow rate and either the fan amperage or pressure drop every 15 minutes during each run of the particulate matter performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate and record the average scrubber water flow rate and either the average fan amperage or average pressure drop for each individual test run. Your operating limits are established as the lowest average scrubber water flow rate and either the lowest average fan amperage or pressure drop value corresponding to any of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For a dry electrostatic precipitator subject to performance testing in Sec. 63.9620 and operating limits in Sec. 63.9590(b)(3), you must establish a site-specific operating limit according to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the operating limit for your dry electrostatic precipitator is a 6-minute average opacity of emissions value, then you must follow the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Using the continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) required in Sec. 63.9631(d)(1), measure and record the opacity of emissions from each control device stack during the particulate matter performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Compute and record the 6-minute opacity averages from 24 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period (e.g., at 15-second intervals) during the test runs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Using the opacity measurements from a performance test that meets the emission limit, determine the opacity value corresponding to the 99 percent upper confidence level of a normal distribution of the 6-minute opacity averages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the operating limit for your dry electrostatic precipitator is the daily average secondary voltage and daily average secondary current for each field, then you must follow the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Using the CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631(d)(2), measure and record the secondary voltage and secondary current for each dry electrostatic precipitator field every 15 minutes during each run of the particulate matter performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate and record the average secondary voltage and secondary current for each dry electrostatic precipitator field for each individual test run. Your operating limits are established as the lowest average secondary voltage and secondary current value for each dry electrostatic precipitator field corresponding to any of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For a wet electrostatic precipitator subject to performance testing in Sec. 63.9620 and operating limit in Sec. 63.9590(b)(4), you must establish a site-specific operating limit according to the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Using the CPMS required in Sec. 63.9631(e), measure and record the parametric values in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section for each wet electrostatic precipitator field every 15 minutes during each run of the particulate matter performance test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Secondary voltage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Water flow rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Stack outlet temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each individual test run, calculate and record the average value for each operating parameter in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section for each wet electrostatic precipitator field. Your operating limits are established as the lowest average value for each operating parameter corresponding to any of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, dynamic wet scrubber, dry electrostatic precipitator, wet electrostatic precipitator, or baghouse, and it is subject to performance testing in Sec. 63.9620, you must submit a site-specific monitoring plan in accordance with Sec. 63.9631(f). The site-specific monitoring plan must include the site-specific procedures for demonstrating initial and continuous compliance with the corresponding operating limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may change the operating limits for any air pollution control device as long as you meet the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a written notification to the Administrator of your request to conduct a new performance test to revise the operating limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limitation in Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establish revised operating limits according to the applicable procedures in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p>
