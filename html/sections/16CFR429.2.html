                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission is cognizant of the significant burden imposed  upon door-to-door sellers by the various and often inconsistent State  laws that provide the buyer the right to cancel a door-to-door sales  transaction. However, it does not believe that this constitutes  sufficient justification for preempting all of the provisions of such  laws and the ordinances of the political subdivisions of the various  States. The rulemaking record in this proceeding supports the view that  the joint and coordinated efforts of both the Commission and State and  local officials are required to insure that consumers who have purchased  from a door-to-door seller something they do not want, do not need, or  cannot afford, be accorded a unilateral right to rescind, without  penalty, their agreements to purchase those goods or services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part will not be construed to annul, or exempt any seller  from complying with, the laws of any State or the ordinances of a  political subdivision thereof that regulate door-to-door sales, except  to the extent that such laws or ordinances, if they permit door-to-door  selling, are directly inconsistent with the provisions of this part.  Such laws or ordinances which do not accord the buyer, with respect to  the particular transaction, a right to cancel a door-to-door sale that  is substantially the same or greater than that provided in this part,  which permit the imposition of any fee or penalty on the buyer for the  exercise of such right, or which do not provide for giving the buyer a  notice of the right to cancel the transaction in substantially the same  form and manner provided for in this part, are among those which will be  considered directly inconsistent.
