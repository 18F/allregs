If the procedures that the HA or owner intends to use to publicize the availability of this program are unlikely to reach persons of any particular race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or mental or physical disability who may qualify for admission to the program, the HA or owner must establish additional procedures that will ensure that such persons are made aware of the availability of the program. The HA or owner must also adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons can obtain information concerning the existence and location of services and facilities that are accessible to persons with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> First priority for homeless individuals.

The owner is responsible for tenant selection and may refuse any individual, provided the owner does not unlawfully discriminate. If the owner rejects an individual, and the individual believes that the owner's rejection was the result of unlawful discrimination, the individual may request the assistance of the HA in resolving the issue and may also file a complaint with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity in accordance with 24 CFR 103.25. If the individual requests the assistance of the HA, and if the HA cannot resolve the complaint promptly, the HA should advise the individual that he or she may file a complaint with HUD, and provide the individual with the address of the nearest HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Briefing of individuals.

The HA must reexamine the income of all individuals at least once every 12 months. After consultation with the individual and upon verification of the information, the HA must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and verify that only one individual is occupying the unit. The HA must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment. At each regular reexamination, the HA must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, subpart E concerning verification of immigration status of any new family member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interim reexaminations. The individual shall supply such certification, release, information, or documentation as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary, including submissions required for interim reexaminations of individual income and determinations as to whether only one individual is occupying the unit.

Section 882.510 applies to this program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Termination of tenancy. Section 882.511 applies to this program.

(1) Each approved applicant receiving assistance under this program, except HAs, must provide for the participation of not less than one homeless individual or formerly homeless individual on the board of directors or other equivalent policymaking entity of such applicant, to the extent that the entity considers and makes policies and decisions regarding the rehabilitation of any housing with assistance under this subpart. This requirement is waived if the applicant is unable to meet this requirement and presents a plan that HUD approves to consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making such policies and decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To the maximum extent practicable, each approved applicant must involve homeless individuals and families, through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, in rehabilitating and operating facilities assisted under this subpart, and in providing services for occupants of such facilities.
