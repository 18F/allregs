                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A keel cooler installation used for engine cooling must be designed to prevent flooding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e), a shutoff valve must be located where the cooler piping penetrates the shell, as near the shell as practicable, except where the penetration is forward of the collision bulkhead.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The thickness of the inlet and discharge connections, outboard of the shutoff values required by paragraph (b) of this section, must be at least Schedule 80.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Short lengths of approved nonmetallic flexible hose, fixed by two hose clamps at each end of the hose, may be used at machinery connections for a keel cooler installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shutoff valves are not required for integral keel coolers. A keel cooler is considered integral to the hull if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cooler structure is fabricated from material of the same thickness and quality as the hull;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The flexible connections are located well above the deepest subdivision draft;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The end of the structure is faired to the hull with a slope no greater than 4 to 1; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Full penetration welds are employed in the fabrication of the structure and its attachment to the hull.
