                            <p class="depth0">The fair market value of notes, secured or unsecured, is presumed to  be the amount of unpaid principal, plus interest accrued to the date of  death, unless the executor establishes that the value is lower or that  the notes are worthless. However, items of interest shall be separately  stated on the estate tax return. If not returned at face value, plus  accrued interest, satisfactory evidence must be submitted that the note  is worth less than the unpaid amount (because of the interest rate, date  of maturity, or other cause), or that the note is uncollectible, either  in whole or in part (by reason of the insolvency of the party or parties  liable, or for other cause), and that any property pledged or mortgaged  as security is insufficient to satisfy the obligation.</p>
