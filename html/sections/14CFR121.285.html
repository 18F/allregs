                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) or this section, no certificate holder may carry cargo in the passenger compartment of an airplane.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cargo may be carried anywhere in the passenger compartment if it is carried in an approved cargo bin that meets the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bin must withstand the load factors and emergency landing conditions applicable to the passenger seats of the airplane in which the bin is installed, multiplied by a factor of 1.15, using the combined weight of the bin and the maximum weight of cargo that may be carried in the bin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum weight of cargo that the bin is approved to carry and any instructions necessary to insure proper weight distribution within the bin must be conspicuously marked on the bin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bin may not impose any load on the floor or other structure of the airplane that exceeds the load limitations of that structure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The bin must be attached to the seat tracks or to the floor structure of the airplane, and its attachment must withstand the load factors and emergency landing conditions applicable to the passenger seats of the airplane in which the bin is installed, multiplied by either the factor 1.15 or the seat attachment factor specified for the airplane, whichever is greater, using the combined weight of the bin and the maximum weight of cargo that may be carried in the bin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The bin may not be installed in a position that restricts access to or use of any required emergency exit, or of the aisle in the passenger compartment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The bin must be fully enclosed and made of material that is at least flame resistant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Suitable safeguards must be provided within the bin to prevent the cargo from shifting under emergency landing conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The bin may not be installed in a position that obscures any passenger's view of the ``seat belt'' sign ``no smoking'' sign, or any required exit sign, unless an auxiliary sign or other approved means for proper notification of the passenger is provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cargo may be carried aft of a bulkhead or divider in any passenger compartment provided the cargo is restrained to the load factors in Sec. 25.561(b)(3) and is loaded as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is properly secured by a safety belt or other tiedown having enough strength to eliminate the possibility of shifting under all normally anticipated flight and ground conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is packaged or covered in a manner to avoid possible injury to passengers and passenger compartment occupants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It does not impose any load on seats or the floor structure that exceeds the load limitation for those components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Its location does not restrict access to or use of any required emergency or regular exit, or of the aisle in the passenger compartment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Its location does not obscure any passenger's view of the ``seat belt'' sign, ``no smoking'' sign, or required exit sign, unless an auxiliary sign or other approved means for proper notification of the passenger is provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cargo, including carry-on baggage, may be carried anywhere in the passenger compartment of a nontransport category airplane type certificated after December 31, 1964, if it is carried in an approved cargo rack, bin, or compartment installed in or on the airplane, if it is secured by an approved means, or if it is carried in accordance with each of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For cargo, it is properly secured by a safety belt or other tie-down having enough strength to eliminate the possibility of shifting under all normally anticipated flight and ground conditions, or for carry-on baggage, it is restrained so as to prevent its movement during air turbulence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is packaged or covered to avoid possible injury to occupants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It does not impose any load on seats or in the floor structure that exceeds the load limitation for those components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is not located in a position that obstructs the access to, or use of, any required emergency or regular exit, or the use of the aisle between the crew and the passenger compartment, or is located in a position that obscures any passenger's view of the ``seat belt'' sign, ``no smoking'' sign or placard, or any required exit sign, unless an auxiliary sign or other approved means for proper notification of the passengers is provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is not carried directly above seated occupants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> It is stowed in compliance with this section for takeoff and landing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For cargo-only operations, paragraph (d)(4) of this section does not apply if the cargo is loaded so that at least one emergency or regular exit is available to provide all occupants of the airplane a means of unobstructed exit from the airplane if an emergency occurs.
