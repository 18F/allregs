                                Sec. 1.881-3  Conduit financing arrangements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules and definitions--(1) Purpose and scope. Pursuant  to the authority of section 7701(l), this section provides rules that  permit the director of field operations to disregard, for purposes of  section 881, the participation of one or more intermediate entities in a  financing arrangement where such entities are acting as conduit  entities. For purposes of this section, any reference to tax imposed  under section 881 includes, except as otherwise provided and as the  context may require, a reference to tax imposed under sections 871 or  884(f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(A)</em> or required to be withheld under section 1441 or 1442. See  Sec. 1.881-4 for recordkeeping requirements concerning financing  arrangements. See Sec. Sec. 1.1441-3(g) and 1.1441-7(f) for withholding  rules applicable to conduit financing arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this section and Sec. Sec. 1.881-4, 1.1441-3(g) and 1.1441-7(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Financing arrangement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Financing arrangement  means a series of transactions by which one person (the financing  entity) advances money or other property, or grants rights to use  property, and another person (the financed entity) receives money or  other property, or rights to use property, if the advance and receipt  are effected through one or more other persons (intermediate entities)  and, except in cases to which paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section  applies, there are financing transactions linking the financing entity,  each of the intermediate entities, and the financed entity. A transfer  of money or other property in satisfaction of a repayment obligation is  not an advance of money or other property. A financing arrangement  exists regardless of the order in which the transactions are entered  into, but only for the period during which all of the financing  transactions coexist. See Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 of paragraph (e) of  this section for illustrations of the term financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Treatment of disregarded entities. For purposes of this section,  the term person includes a business entity that is disregarded as an  entity separate from its single member owner under Sec. 301.7701-1  through Sec. 301.7701-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Financing transaction--(A) In general. Financing transaction  means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Debt;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(B)</em> of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any lease or license; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> shall not apply to the posting of  collateral unless the collateral consists of cash or the person holding  the collateral is permitted to reduce the collateral to cash (through a  transfer, grant of a security interest or similar transaction) prior to  default on the financing transaction secured by the collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitation on inclusion of stock or similar interests--(1) In  general. Stock in a corporation (or a similar interest in a partnership,  trust, or other person) will constitute a financing transaction only if  one of the following conditions is satisfied--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The issuer is required to redeem the stock or similar interest  at a specified time or the holder has the right to require the issuer to  redeem the stock or similar interest or to make any other payment with  respect to the stock or similar interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The issuer has the right to redeem the stock or similar  interest, but only if, based on all of the facts and circumstances as of  the issue date, redemption pursuant to that right is more likely than  not to occur; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner of the stock or similar interest has the right to  require a person related to the issuer (or any other person who is  acting pursuant to a plan or arrangement with the issuer) to acquire the  stock or similar interest or make a payment with respect to the stock or  similar interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules of special application--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Existence of a right. For  purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B), a person will be considered to  have a right to cause a redemption or payment if the person has the  right (other than rights arising, in the ordinary course, between the  date that a payment is declared and the date that a payment is made) to  enforce the payment through a legal proceeding or to cause the issuer to  be liquidated if it fails to redeem the interest or to make a payment. A  person will not be considered to have a right to force a redemption or a  payment if the right is derived solely from ownership of a controlling  interest in the issuer in cases where the control does not arise from a  default or similar contingency under the instrument. The person is  considered to have such a right if the person has the right as of the  issue date or, as of the issue date, it is more likely than not that the  person will receive such a right, whether through the occurrence of a  contingency or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conduit entity means an intermediate entity whose  participation in the financing arrangement may be disregarded in whole  or in part pursuant to this section, whether or not the director of  field operations has made a determination that the intermediate entity  should be disregarded under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Conduit financing arrangement means a financing arrangement  that is effected through one or more conduit entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Related means related within the meaning of sections 267(b) or  707(b)(1), or controlled within the meaning of   section 482, and the regulations under those sections. For purposes of  determining whether a person is related to another person, the  constructive ownership rules of section 318 shall apply, and the  attribution rules of section 267(c) also shall apply to the extent they  attribute ownership to persons to whom section 318 does not attribute  ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disregard of participation of conduit entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Authority of  director of field operations. The director of field operations may  determine that the participation of a conduit entity in a conduit  financing arrangement should be disregarded for purposes of section 881.  For this purpose, an intermediate entity will constitute a conduit  entity if it meets the standards of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.  The director of field operations has discretion to determine the manner  in which the standards of paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply,  including the financing transactions and parties composing the financing  arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of disregarding conduit entity--(A) In general. If the  director of field operations determines that the participation of a  conduit entity in a financing arrangement should be disregarded, the  financing arrangement is recharacterized as a transaction directly  between the remaining parties to the financing arrangement (in most  cases, the financed entity and the financing entity) for purposes of  section 881. To the extent that a disregarded conduit entity actually  receives or makes payments pursuant to a conduit financing arrangement,  it is treated as an agent of the financing entity. Except as otherwise  provided, the recharacterization of the conduit financing arrangement  also applies for purposes of sections 871, 884(f)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, 1441, and 1442  and other procedural provisions relating to those sections. This  recharacterization will not otherwise affect a taxpayer's Federal income  tax liability under any substantive provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code. Thus, for example, the recharacterization generally applies for  purposes of section 1461, in order to impose liability on a withholding  agent who fails to withhold as required under Sec. 1.1441-3(g), but not  for purposes of Sec. 1.882-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> does not, however, extend to qualification of a  payment for any exemption from withholding tax under the Internal  Revenue Code or a provision of any applicable tax treaty if such  qualification depends on the terms of, or other similar facts or  circumstances relating to, the financing transaction to which the  financing entity is a party that do not apply to the financing  transaction to which the financed entity is a party. Thus, for example,  payments made by a financed entity that is not a bank cannot qualify for  the exemption provided by section 881(i) of the Code even if the loan  between the financing entity and the conduit entity is a bank deposit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effect of income tax treaties. Where the participation of a  conduit entity in a conduit financing arrangement is disregarded  pursuant to this section, it is disregarded for all purposes of section  881, including for purposes of applying any relevant income tax  treaties. Accordingly, the conduit entity may not claim the benefits of  a tax treaty between its country of residence and the United States to  reduce the amount of tax due under section 881 with respect to payments  made pursuant to the conduit financing arrangement. The financing entity  may, however, claim the benefits of any income tax treaty under which it  is entitled to benefits in   order to reduce the rate of tax on payments made pursuant to the conduit  financing arrangement that are recharacterized in accordance with  paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Effect on withholding tax. For the effect of recharacterization  on withholding obligations, see Sec. Sec. 1.1441-3(g) and 1.1441-7(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Special rule for a financing entity that is unrelated to both  intermediate entity and financed entity--(1) Liability of financing  entity. Notwithstanding the fact that a financing arrangement is a  conduit financing arrangement, a financing entity that is unrelated to  the financed entity and the conduit entity (or entities) shall not  itself be liable for tax under section 881 unless the financing entity  knows or has reason to know that the financing arrangement is a conduit  financing arrangement. But see Sec. 1.1441-3(g) for the withholding  agent's withholding obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Financing entity's knowledge--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A financing entity  knows or has reason to know that the financing arrangement is a conduit  financing arrangement only if the financing entity knows or has reason  to know of facts sufficient to establish that the financing arrangement  is a conduit financing arrangement, including facts sufficient to  establish that the participation of the intermediate entity in the  financing arrangement is pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. A person that  knows only of the financing transactions that comprise the financing  arrangement will not be considered to know or have reason to know of  facts sufficient to establish that the financing arrangement is a  conduit financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(E)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Limitation on taxpayer's use of this section. A taxpayer may  not apply this section to reduce the amount of its Federal income tax  liability by disregarding the form of its financing transactions for  Federal income tax purposes or by compelling the director of field  operations to do so. See, however, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section  for rules regarding the taxpayer's ability to show that the  participation of one or more intermediate entities results in no  significant reduction in tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Standard for treatment as a conduit entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An  intermediate entity is a conduit entity with respect to a financing  arrangement if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The participation of the intermediate entity (or entities) in  the financing arrangement reduces the tax imposed by section 881  (determined by comparing the aggregate tax imposed under section 881 on  payments made on financing transactions making up the financing  arrangement with the tax that would have been imposed under paragraph  (d) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The participation of the intermediate entity in the financing  arrangement is pursuant to a tax avoidance plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The intermediate entity is related to the financing entity or  the financed entity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The intermediate entity would not have participated in the  financing arrangement on substantially the same   terms but for the fact that the financing entity engaged in the  financing transaction with the intermediate entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple intermediate entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a financing  arrangement involves multiple intermediate entities, the director of  field operations will determine whether each of the intermediate  entities is a conduit entity. The director of field operations will make  the determination by applying the special rules for multiple  intermediate entities provided in this section or, if no special rules  are provided, applying principles consistent with those of paragraph  (a)(4)(i) of this section to each of the intermediate entities in the  financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule for related persons. The director of field  operations may treat related intermediate entities as a single  intermediate entity if he determines that one of the principal purposes  for the involvement of multiple intermediate entities in the financing  arrangement is to prevent the characterization of an intermediate entity  as a conduit entity, to reduce the portion of a payment that is subject  to withholding tax or otherwise to circumvent the provisions of this  section. This determination shall be based upon all of the facts and  circumstances, including, but not limited to, the factors set forth in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If a director of field operations  determines that related persons are to be treated as a single  intermediate entity, financing transactions between such related parties  that are part of the conduit financing arrangement shall be disregarded  for purposes of applying this section. See Examples 8 and 9 of paragraph  (e) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph  (a)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section are among the facts and  circumstances taken into account in determining whether the  participation of an intermediate entity in a financing arrangement has  as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of tax imposed by section  881.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Significant reduction in tax. The director of field operations  will consider whether the participation of the intermediate entity (or  entities) in the financing arrangement significantly reduces the tax  that otherwise would have been imposed under section 881. The fact that  an intermediate entity is a resident of a country that has an income tax  treaty with the United States that significantly reduces the tax that  otherwise would have been imposed under section 881 is not sufficient,  by itself, to establish the existence of a tax avoidance plan. The  determination of whether the participation of an intermediate entity  significantly reduces the tax generally is made by comparing the  aggregate tax imposed under section 881 on payments made on financing  transactions making up the financing arrangement with the tax that would  be imposed under paragraph (d) of this section. However, the taxpayer   is not barred from presenting evidence that the financing entity, as  determined by the director of field operations, was itself an  intermediate entity and another entity should be treated as the  financing entity for purposes of applying this test. A reduction in the  absolute amount of tax may be significant even if the reduction in rate  is not. A reduction in the amount of tax may be significant if the  reduction is large in absolute terms or in relative terms. See Examples  14, 15 and 16 of paragraph (e) of this section for illustrations of this  factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ability to make the advance. The director of field operations  will consider whether the intermediate entity had sufficient available  money or other property of its own to have made the advance to the  financed entity without the advance of money or other property to it by  the financing entity (or in the case of multiple intermediate entities,  whether each of the intermediate entities had sufficient available money  or other property of its own to have made the advance to either the  financed entity or another intermediate entity without the advance of  money or other property to it by either the financing entity or another  intermediate entity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Time period between financing transactions. The director of  field operations will consider the length of the period of time that  separates the advances of money or other property, or the grants of  rights to use property, by the financing entity to the intermediate  entity (in the case of multiple intermediate entities, from one  intermediate entity to another), and ultimately by the intermediate  entity to the financed entity. A short period of time is evidence of the  existence of a tax avoidance plan while a long period of time is  evidence that there is not a tax avoidance plan. See Example 17 of  paragraph (e) of this section for an illustration of this factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>  is evidence that the participation of the parties to that transaction in  the financing arrangement is not pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. A  loan will not be considered to occur in the ordinary course of the  active conduct of complementary or integrated trades or businesses  unless the loan is a trade receivable or the parties to the transaction  are actively engaged in a banking, insurance, financing or similar trade  or business and such business consists predominantly of transactions  with customers who are not related persons. See Example 18 of paragraph  (e) of this section for an illustration of this factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Presumption if significant financing activities performed by a  related intermediate entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. It shall be presumed that  the participation of an intermediate entity (or entities) in a financing  arrangement is not pursuant to a tax avoidance plan if the intermediate  entity is related to either or both the financing entity or the financed  entity and the intermediate entity performs significant financing  activities with respect to the financing transactions forming part of  the financing arrangement to which it is a party. This presumption may  be rebutted if the director of field operations establishes that the  participation of the intermediate entity in the financing arrangement is  pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. See Examples 22, 23 and 24 of  paragraph (e) of this section for illustrations of this presumption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>, to be   applied by substituting the term intermediate entity for the term  controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(2)</em> of  this section with respect to such financing transactions, and the  participation of the intermediate entity in the financing transactions  produces (or reasonably can be expected to produce) efficiency savings  by reducing transaction costs and overhead and other fixed costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Business activity and risk management requirements. An  intermediate entity will be considered to perform significant financing  activities only if, within the country in which the intermediate entity  is organized (or, if different, within the country with respect to which  the intermediate entity is claiming the benefits of a tax treaty), its  officers and employees--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exercise management over, and actively conduct, the day-to-day  operations of the intermediate entity. Such operations must consist of a  substantial trade or business or the supervision, administration and  financing for a substantial group of related persons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Actively manage, on an ongoing basis, material market risks  arising from such financing transactions as an integral part of the  management of the intermediate entity's financial and capital  requirements (including management of risks of currency and interest  rate fluctuations) and management of the intermediate entity's short- term investments of working capital by entering into transactions with  unrelated persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for trade receivables and payables entered into in  the ordinary course of business. If the activities of the intermediate  entity consist in whole or in part of cash management for a controlled  group of which the intermediate entity is a member, then employees of  the intermediate entity need not have participated in arranging any such  financing transactions that arise in the ordinary course of a  substantial trade or business of either the financed entity or the  financing entity. Officers or employees of the financing entity or  financed entity, however, must have participated actively and materially  in arranging the transaction that gave rise to the trade receivable or  trade payable. Cash management includes the operation of a sweep account  whereby the intermediate entity nets intercompany trade payables and  receivables arising from transactions among the other members of the  controlled group and between members of the controlled group and  unrelated persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Activities of officers and employees of related persons. Except  as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(3) of this section, in applying  this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B), the activities of an officer or employee  of an intermediate entity will not constitute significant financing  activities if any officer or employee of a related person participated  materially in any of the activities described in this paragraph, other  than to approve any guarantee of a financing transaction or to exercise  general supervision and control over the policies of the intermediate  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of whether an unrelated intermediate entity would  not have participated in financing arrangement on substantially the same  terms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The determination of whether an intermediate  entity would not have participated in a financing arrangement on  substantially the same terms but for the financing transaction between  the financing entity and the intermediate entity shall be based upon all  of the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of guarantee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The director of field  operations may presume that the intermediate entity would not have  participated in the financing arrangement on substantially the same  terms if there is a guarantee of the financed entity's liability to the  intermediate entity (or in the case of   multiple intermediate entities, a guarantee of the intermediate entity's  liability to the intermediate entity that advanced money or property, or  granted rights to use other property). However, a guarantee that was  neither in existence nor contemplated on the last date that any of the  financing transactions comprising the financing arrangement is entered  into does not give rise to this presumption. A taxpayer may rebut this  presumption by producing clear and convincing evidence that the  intermediate entity would have participated in the financing transaction  with the financed entity on substantially the same terms even if the  financing entity had not entered into a financing transaction with the  intermediate entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of guarantee. For the purposes of this paragraph  (c)(2), a guarantee is any arrangement under which a person, directly or  indirectly, assures, on a conditional or unconditional basis, the  payment of another person's obligation with respect to a financing  transaction. The term shall be interpreted in accordance with the  definition of the term in section 163(j)(6)(D)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of amount of tax liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amount of payment  subject to recharacterization--(i) In general. If a financing  arrangement is a conduit financing arrangement, a portion of each  payment made by the financed entity with respect to the financing  transactions that comprise the conduit financing arrangement shall be  recharacterized as a transaction directly between the financed entity  and the financing entity. If the aggregate principal amount of the  financing transaction(s) to which the financed entity is a party is less  than or equal to the aggregate principal amount of the financing  transaction(s) linking any of the parties to the financing arrangement,  the entire amount of the payment shall be so recharacterized. If the  aggregate principal amount of the financing transaction(s) to which the  financed entity is a party is greater than the aggregate principal  amount of the financing transaction(s) linking any of the parties to the  financing arrangement, then the recharacterized portion shall be  determined by multiplying the payment by a fraction the numerator of  which is equal to the lowest aggregate principal amount of the financing  transaction(s) linking any of the parties to the financing arrangement  (other than financing transactions that are disregarded pursuant to  paragraphs (a)(2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)</em> and (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section) and the  denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of the financing  transaction(s) to which the financed entity is a party. In the case of  financing transactions the principal amount of which is subject to  adjustment, the fraction shall be determined using the average  outstanding principal amounts for the period to which the payment  relates. The average principal amount may be computed using any method  applied consistently that reflects with reasonable accuracy the amount  outstanding for the period. See Example 25 of paragraph (e) of this  section for an illustration of the calculation of the amount of tax  liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of principal amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Unless  otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), the principal amount  equals the amount of money advanced, or the fair market value of other  property advanced or subject to a lease or license, in the financing  transaction. In general, fair market value is calculated in U.S. dollars  as of the close of business on the day on which the financing  transaction is entered into. However, if the property advanced, or the  right to use property granted, by the financing entity is the same as  the property or rights received by the financed entity, the fair market  value of the property or right shall be determined as of the close of  business on the last date that any of the financing transactions  comprising the financing arrangement is entered into. In the case of  fungible property, property of the same type shall be considered to be  the same property. See Example 26 of paragraph (e) for an illustration  of the calculation of the principal amount in the case of financing  transactions involving fungible property. The principal amount of a  financing transaction shall be subject to adjustments, as set forth in  this paragraph (d)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Debt instruments and certain stock. In the case of a debt  instrument or of   stock that is subject to the current inclusion rules of sections  305(c)(3) or (e), the principal amount generally will be equal to the  issue price. However, if the fair market value on the issue date differs  materially from the issue price, the fair market value of the debt  instrument shall be used in lieu of the instrument's issue price.  Appropriate adjustments will be made for accruals of original issue  discount and repayments of principal (including accrued original issue  discount).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Partnership and trust interests. In the case of a partnership  interest or an interest in a trust, the principal amount is equal to the  fair market value of the money or property contributed to the  partnership or trust in return for that partnership or trust interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Leases or licenses. In the case of a lease or license, the  principal amount is equal to the fair market value of the property  subject to the lease or license on the date on which the lease or  license is entered into. The principal amount shall be adjusted for  depreciation or amortization, calculated on a basis that accurately  reflects the anticipated decline in the value of the property over its  life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rate of tax. The rate at which tax is imposed under section 881  on the portion of the payment that is recharacterized pursuant to  paragraph (d)(1) of this section is determined by reference to the  nature of the recharacterized transaction, as determined under  paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this section. For  purposes of these examples, unless otherwise indicated, it is assumed  that FP, a corporation organized in country N, owns all of the stock of  FS, a corporation organized in country T, and DS, a corporation  organized in the United States. Country T, but not country N, has an  income tax treaty with the United States. The treaty exempts interest,  rents and royalties paid by a resident of one state (the source state)  to a resident of the other state from tax in the source state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1996, BK, a bank  organized in country T, lends $1,000,000 to DS in exchange for a note  issued by DS. FP guarantees to BK that DS will satisfy its repayment  obligation on the loan. There are no other transactions between FP and  BK.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> through (4) of this section. Therefore,  these transactions do not constitute a financing arrangement as defined  in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1996, FP lends  $1,000,000 to DS in exchange for a note issued by DS. On January 1,  1997, FP assigns the DS note to FS in exchange for a note issued by FS.  After receiving notice of the assignment, DS remits payments due under  its note to FS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this  section, and together constitute a financing arrangement within the  meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3.Participation of a disregarded intermediate entity. The  facts are the same as in Example 2, except that FS is an entity that is  disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, FP, under Sec.  301.7701-3. Under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section, FS is a person  and, therefore, may itself be an intermediate entity that is linked by  financing transactions to other persons in a financing arrangement. The  DS note held by FS and the FS note held by FP are financing transactions  within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, and together  constitute a financing arrangement within the meaning of paragraph  (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On December 1, 1994 FP creates  a special purposes subsidiary, FS. On that date FP capitalizes FS with  $1,000,000 in cash and $10,000,000 in debt from BK, a Country N bank. On  January 1, 1995, C, a U.S. person, purchases an automobile from DS in  return for an installment note. On August 1, 1995, DS sells a number of  installment notes, including C's, to FS in exchange for $10,000,000. DS  continues to service the installment notes for FS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em>  of this section, and together constitute a financing arrangement within  the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and DS has  received from M the statement required by section 881(c)(2)(B)(ii). One  of the principal purposes for the absence of a financing transaction  between BK and M is the avoidance of the application of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section for the authority to  treat BK and M as a single intermediate entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, FP lends $10,000,000 to FS in exchange for a 10- year note that pays interest annually at a rate of 8 percent per annum.  On January 2, 1995, FS contributes $10,000,000 to FS2, a wholly-owned  subsidiary of FS organized in country T, in exchange for common stock of  FS2. On January 1, 1996, FS2 lends $10,000,000 to DS in exchange for an  8-year note that pays interest annually at a rate of 10 percent per  annum. FS is a holding company whose most significant asset is the stock  of FS2. Throughout the period that the FP-FS loan is outstanding, FS  causes FS2 to make distributions to FS, most of which are used to make  interest and principal payments on the FP-FS loan. Without the  distributions from FS2, FS would not have had the funds with which to  make payments on the FP-FS loan. One of the principal purposes for the  absence of a financing transaction between FS and FS2 is the avoidance  of the application of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section. In  such a case, FS and FS2 would be considered a single intermediate entity  for purposes of this section. See also paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this  section for the authority to treat FS and FS2 as a single intermediate  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP is a corporation organized in country T that is actively engaged  in a substantial manufacturing business. FP has a revolving credit  facility with a syndicate of banks, none of which is related to FP and  FP's subsidiaries, which provides that FP may borrow up to a maximum of  $100,000,000 at a time. The revolving credit facility provides that DS  and certain other subsidiaries of FP may borrow directly from the  syndicate at the same interest rates as FP, but each subsidiary is  required to indemnify the syndicate banks for any withholding taxes  imposed on interest payments by the country in which the subsidiary is  organized. BK, a bank that is organized in country N, is the agent for  the syndicate. Some of the syndicate banks are organized in country N,  but others are residents of country O, a country that has an income tax  treaty with the United States which allows the United States to impose a  tax on interest at a maximum rate of 10 percent. It is reasonable for BK  and the syndicate banks to have determined that FP will be able to meet  its payment obligations on a maximum principal amount of $100,000,000  out of the cash flow of its manufacturing business. At various times  throughout 1995, FP borrows under the revolving credit facility until  the outstanding principal amount reaches the maximum amount of  $100,000,000. On December 31, 1995, FP receives $100,000,000 from a  public offering of its equity. On January 1, 1996, FP pays BK  $90,000,000 to reduce the outstanding principal amount under the  revolving credit facility and lends $10,000,000 to DS. FP would have  repaid the entire principal amount, and DS would have borrowed directly  from the syndicate, but for the fact that DS did not want to incur the  U.S. withholding tax that would have applied to payments made directly  by DS to the syndicate banks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, BK  and the syndicate banks are presumed not to know that the financing  arrangement is a conduit financing arrangement. The syndicate banks are  unrelated to both FP and DS, and FP is actively engaged in a substantial  trade or business--that is, the cash flow   from FP's manufacturing business is sufficient for the banks to expect  that FP will be able to make the payments required under the financing  transaction. See Sec. 1.1441-3(g) for the withholding obligations of  the withholding agents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, FP lends $10,000,000 to FS in exchange  for a 10-year note that pays interest annually at a rate of 8 percent  per annum. On January 2, 1995, FS contributes $9,900,000 to FS2, a  wholly-owned subsidiary of FS organized in country T, in exchange for  common stock and lends $100,000 to FS2. On January 1, 1996, FS2 lends  $10,000,000 to DS in exchange for an 8-year note that pays interest  annually at a rate of 10 percent per annum. FS is a holding company that  has no significant assets other than the stock of FS2. Throughout the  period that the FP-FS loan is outstanding, FS causes FS2 to make  distributions to FS, most of which are used to make interest and  principal payments on the FP-FS loan. Without the distributions from  FS2, FS would not have had the funds with which to make payments on the  FP-FS loan. One of the principal purposes for structuring the  transactions between FS and FS2 as primarily a contribution of capital  is to reduce the amount of the payment that would be recharacterized  under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section, the  director of field operations may treat FS and FS2 as a single  intermediate entity for purposes of this section since one of the  principal purposes for the participation of multiple intermediate  entities is to reduce the amount of the tax liability on any  recharacterized payment by inserting a financing transaction with a low  principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995,  FP deposits $1,000,000 with BK, a bank that is organized in country T  and is unrelated to FP and its subsidiaries, FS and DS. On January 1,  1996, at a time when the FP-BK deposit is still outstanding, BK lends  $500,000 to BK2, a bank that is wholly-owned by BK and is organized in  country T. On the same date, BK2 lends $500,000 to FS. On July 1, 1996,  FS lends $500,000 to DS. FP pledges its deposit with BK to BK2 in  support of FS' obligation to repay the BK2 loan. FS', BK's and BK2's  participation in the financing arrangement is pursuant to a tax  avoidance plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The conditions of paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this  section are satisfied because the participation of BK, BK2 and FS in the  financing arrangement reduces the tax imposed by section 881, and FS',  BK's and BK2's participation in the financing arrangement is pursuant to  a tax avoidance plan. However, since BK and BK2 are unrelated to FP and  DS, under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C)(2) of this section, BK and BK2 will be  treated as conduit entities only if BK and BK2 would not have  participated in the financing arrangement on substantially the same  terms but for the financing transaction between FP and BK.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> It is presumed that BK2 would not have participated in the  financing arrangement on substantially the same terms but for the BK-BK2  financing transaction because FP's pledge of an asset in support of FS'  obligation to repay the BK2 loan is a guarantee within the meaning of  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. If the taxpayer does not rebut  this presumption by clear and convincing evidence, then BK2 will be a  conduit entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Because BK and BK2 are related intermediate entities, the  director of field operations must determine whether one of the principal  purposes for the involvement of multiple intermediate entities was to  prevent characterization of an entity as a conduit entity. In making  this determination, the director of field operations may consider the  fact that the involvement of two related intermediate entities prevents  the presumption regarding guarantees from applying to BK. In the absence  of evidence showing a business purpose for the involvement of both BK  and BK2, the director of field operations may treat BK and BK2 as a  single intermediate entity for purposes of determining whether they  would have participated in the financing arrangement on substantially  the same terms but for the financing transaction between FP and BK. The  presumption that applies to BK2 therefore will apply to BK. If the  taxpayer does not rebut this presumption by clear and convincing  evidence, then BK will be a conduit entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On February 1, 1995, FP issues  debt to the public that would satisfy the requirements of section  871(h)(2)(A) (relating to obligations that are not in registered form)  if issued by a U.S. person. FP lends the proceeds of the debt offering  to DS in exchange for a note.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this  section and together constitute a financing arrangement within the  meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The holders of the FP  debt are the financing entities, FP is the intermediate entity and DS is  the financed entity. Because interest payments on the debt issued by FP  would not have been subject to withholding tax if the debt had been  issued by DS, there is no reduction in tax under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A)  of this section. Accordingly, FP is not a conduit entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, FP licenses to  FS the rights to use a patent in the United States to manufacture  product A. FS agrees to pay FP a fixed   amount in royalties each year under the license. On January 1, 1996, FS  sublicenses to DS the rights to use the patent in the United States.  Under the sublicense, DS agrees to pay FS royalties based upon the units  of product A manufactured by DS each year. Although the formula for  computing the amount of royalties paid by DS to FS differs from the  formula for computing the amount of royalties paid by FS to FP, each  represents an arm's length rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although the royalties paid by DS to FS are exempt from U.S.  withholding tax, the royalty payments between FS and FP are income from  U.S. sources under section 861(a)(4) subject to the 30 percent gross tax  imposed by Sec. 1.881-2(b) and subject to withholding under Sec.  1.1441-2(a). Because the rate of tax imposed on royalties paid by FS to  FP is the same as the rate that would have been imposed on royalties  paid by DS to FP, the participation of FS in the FP-FS-DS financing  arrangement does not reduce the tax imposed by section 881 within the  meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, FP is  not a conduit entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 1995, FS lends  $10,000,000 to DS in exchange for a 10-year note that pays interest  annually at a rate of 8 percent per annum. As was intended at the time  of the loan from FS to DS, on July 1, 1995, FP makes an interest-free  demand loan of $10,000,000 to FS. A principal purpose for FS'  participation in the FP-FS-DS financing arrangement is that FS generally  coordinates the financing for all of FP's subsidiaries (although FS does  not engage in significant financing activities with respect to such  financing transactions). However, another principal purpose for FS'  participation is to allow the parties to benefit from the lower  withholding tax rate provided under the income tax treaty between  country T and the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The financing arrangement satisfies the tax avoidance purpose  requirement of paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section because FS  participated in the financing arrangement pursuant to a plan one of the  principal purposes of which is to allow the parties to benefit from the  country T-U.S. treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DX is a U.S. corporation that  intends to purchase property to use in its manufacturing business. FX is  a partnership organized in country N that is owned in equal parts by LC1  and LC2, leasing companies that are unrelated to DX. BK, a bank  organized in country N and unrelated to DX, LC1 and LC2, lends  $100,000,000 to FX to enable FX to purchase the property. On the same  day, FX purchases the property and engages in a transaction with DX  which is treated as a lease of the property for country N tax purposes  but a loan for U.S. tax purposes. Accordingly, DX is treated as the  owner of the property for U.S. tax purposes. The parties comply with the  requirements of section 881(c) with respect to the debt obligation of DX  to FX. FX and DX structured these transactions in this manner so that  LC1 and LC2 would be entitled to accelerated depreciation deductions  with respect to the property in country N and DX would be entitled to  accelerated depreciation deductions in the United States. None of the  parties would have participated in the transaction if the payments made  by DX were subject to U.S. withholding tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The loan from BK to FX and from FX to DX are financing  transactions and, together constitute a financing arrangement. The  participation of FX in the financing arrangement reduces the tax imposed  by section 881 because payments made to FX, but not BK, qualify for the  portfolio interest exemption of section 881(c) because BK is a bank  making an extension of credit in the ordinary course of its trade or  business within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A). Moreover, because  DX borrowed the money from FX instead of borrowing the money directly  from BK to avoid the tax imposed by section 881, one of the principal  purposes of the participation of FX was to avoid that tax (even though  another principal purpose of the participation of FX was to allow LC1  and LC2 to take advantage of accelerated depreciation deductions in  country N). Assuming that FX would not have participated in the  financing arrangement on substantially the same terms but for the fact  that BK loaned it $100,000,000, FX is a conduit entity and the financing  arrangement is a conduit financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FS owns all of the  stock of FS1, which also is a resident of country T. FS1 owns all of the  stock of DS. On January 1, 1995, FP contributes $10,000,000 to the  capital of FS in return for perpetual preferred stock. On July 1, 1995,  FS lends $10,000,000 to FS1. On January 1, 1996, FS1 lends $10,000,000  to DS. Under the terms of the country T-U.S. income tax treaty, a  country T resident is not entitled to the reduced withholding rate on  interest income provided by the treaty if the resident is entitled to  specified tax benefits under country T law. Although FS1 may deduct  interest paid on the loan from FS, these deductions are not pursuant to  any special tax benefits provided by country T law. However, FS  qualifies for one of the enumerated tax benefits pursuant to which it  may deduct dividends paid with respect to the stock held by FP.  Therefore, if FS had made a loan directly to DS, FS would not have been  entitled to the benefits of the country T-U.S. tax treaty with respect  to payments it received from DS, and such payments would have been  subject to tax under section 881 at a 30 percent rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section and  together constitute a financing arrangement within the meaning of  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of  this section, the significant reduction in tax resulting from the  participation of FS1 in the financing arrangement is evidence that the  participation of FS1 in the financing arrangement is pursuant to a tax  avoidance plan. However, other facts relevant to the presence of such a  plan must also be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP owns 90 percent of  the voting stock of FX, an unlimited liability company organized in  country T. The other 10 percent of the common stock of FX is owned by  FP1, a subsidiary of FP that is organized in country N. Although FX is a  partnership for U.S. tax purposes, FX is entitled to the benefits of the  U.S.-country T income tax treaty because FX is subject to tax in country  T as a resident corporation. On January 1, 1996, FP contributes  $10,000,000 to FX in exchange for an instrument denominated as preferred  stock that pays a dividend of 7 percent and that must be redeemed by FX  in seven years. For U.S. tax purposes, the preferred stock is a  partnership interest. On July 1, 1996, FX makes a loan of $10,000,000 to  DS in exchange for a 7-year note paying interest at 6 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section,  together the transactions constitute a financing arrangement within the  meaning of (a)(2)(i) of this section. Payments of interest made directly  by DS to FP and FP1 would not be eligible for the portfolio interest  exemption and would not be entitled to a reduction in withholding tax  pursuant to a tax treaty. Therefore, there is a significant reduction in  tax resulting from the participation of FX in the financing arrangement,  which is evidence that the participation of FX in the financing  arrangement is pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. However, other facts  relevant to the existence of such a plan must also be taken into  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP owns a 10 percent  interest in the profits and capital of FX, a partnership organized in  country N. The other 90 percent interest in FX is owned by G, an  unrelated corporation that is organized in country T. FX is not engaged  in business in the United States. On January 1, 1996, FP contributes  $10,000,000 to FX in exchange for an instrument documented as perpetual  subordinated debt that provides for quarterly interest payments at 9  percent per annum. Under the terms of the instrument, payments on the  perpetual subordinated debt do not otherwise affect the allocation of  income between the partners. FP has the right to require the liquidation  of FX if FX fails to make an interest payment. For U.S. tax purposes,  the perpetual subordinated debt is treated as a partnership interest in  FX and the payments on the perpetual subordinated debt constitute  guaranteed payments within the meaning of section 707(c). On July 1,  1996, FX makes a loan of $10,000,000 to DS in exchange for a 7-year note  paying interest at 8 percent per annum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section, together the transactions are a  financing arrangement within the meaning of (a)(2)(i) of this section.  Without regard to this section, 90 percent of each interest payment  received by FX would be treated as exempt from U.S. withholding tax  because it is beneficially owned by G, while 10 percent would be subject  to a 30 percent withholding tax because beneficially owned by FP. If FP  held directly the note issued by DS, 100 percent of the interest  payments on the note would have been subject to the 30 percent  withholding tax. The significant reduction in the tax imposed by section  881 resulting from the participation of FX in the financing arrangement  is evidence that the participation of FX in the financing arrangement is  pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. However, other facts relevant to the  presence of such a plan must also be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1,  1995, FP lends $10,000,000 to FS in exchange for a 10-year note that  pays no interest annually. When the note matures, FS is obligated to pay  $24,000,000 to FP. On January 1, 1996, FS lends $10,000,000 to DS in  exchange for a 10-year note that pays interest annually at a rate of 10  percent per annum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this  section and together constitute a financing arrangement within the  meaning of (a)(2)(i) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)  of this section, the short period of time (twelve months) between the  loan by FP to FS and the loan by FS to DS is evidence that the  participation of FS in the financing arrangement is pursuant to a tax  avoidance plan. However, other facts relevant to the presence of such a  plan must also be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP is a holding company. FS is actively engaged in country  T in the business of manufacturing and selling product A. DS  manufactures product B, a principal component in which is product A. FS'  business activity is substantial. On January 1, 1995, FP lends  $100,000,000 to FS to finance FS' business operations. On January 1,  1996, FS ships $30,000,000 of product A to DS. In return, FS creates an  interest-bearing account receivable on its books. FS' shipment is in the  ordinary course of the active conduct of its trade or business (which is  complementary to DS' trade or business.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section and together constitute a  financing arrangement within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this  section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the fact that  DS' liability to FS is created in the ordinary course of the active  conduct of DS' trade or business that is complementary to a business  actively engaged in by DS is evidence that the participation of FS in  the financing arrangement is not pursuant to a tax avoidance plan.  However, other facts relevant to the presence of such a plan must also  be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On February 1,  1995, FP issues debt in Country N that is in registered form within the  meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A). The FP debt would satisfy the  requirements of section 881(c) if the debt were issued by a U.S. person  and the withholding agent received the certification required by section  871(h)(2)(B)(ii). The purchasers of the debt are financial institutions  and there is no reason to believe that they would not furnish Forms W-8.  On March 1, 1995, FP lends a portion of the proceeds of the offering to  DS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section and  together constitute a financing arrangement within the meaning of  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. The owners of the FP debt are the  financing entities, FP is the intermediate entity and DS is the financed  entity. Interest payments on the debt issued by FP would be subject to  withholding tax if the debt were issued by DS, unless DS received all  necessary Forms W-8. Therefore, the participation of FP in the financing  arrangement potentially reduces the tax imposed by section 881(a).  However, because it is reasonable to assume that the purchasers of the  FP debt would have provided certifications in order to avoid the  withholding tax imposed by section 881, there is not a tax avoidance  plan. Accordingly, FP is not a conduit entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Over a period of  years, FP has maintained a deposit with BK, a bank organized in the  United States, that is unrelated to FP and its subsidiaries. FP often  sells goods and purchases raw materials in the United States. FP opened  the bank account with BK in order to facilitate this business and the  amounts it maintains in the account are reasonably related to its  dollar-denominated working capital needs. On January 1, 1995, BK lends  $5,000,000 to DS. After the loan is made, the balance in FP's bank  account remains within a range appropriate to meet FP's working capital  needs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this  section and together constitute a financing arrangement within the  meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Pursuant to section  881(i), interest paid by BK to FP with respect to the bank deposit is  exempt from withholding tax. Interest paid directly by DS to FP would  not be exempt from withholding tax under section 881(i) and therefore  would be subject to a 30% withholding tax. Accordingly, there is a  significant reduction in the tax imposed by section 881, which is  evidence of the existence of a tax avoidance plan. See paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section. However, the director of field operations  also will consider the fact that FP historically has maintained an  account with BK to meet its working capital needs and that, prior to and  after BK's loan to DS, the balance within the account remains within a  range appropriate to meet those business needs as evidence that the  participation of BK in the FP-BK-DS financing arrangement is not  pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. In determining the presence or absence  of a tax avoidance plan, all relevant facts will be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assume the same  facts as in Example 20, except that on January 1, 2000, FP's deposit  with BK substantially exceeds FP's expected working capital needs and on  January 2, 2000, BK lends additional funds to DS. Assume also that BK's  loan to DS provides BK with a right of offset against FP's deposit.  Finally, assume that FP would have lent the funds to DS directly but for  the imposition of the withholding tax on payments made directly to FP by  DS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 19, the transactions in paragraph (i) of this  Example 21 are a financing arrangement within the meaning of paragraph  (a)(2)(i) and the participation of the BK reduces the section 881 tax.  In this case, the presence of funds substantially in excess of FP's  working capital needs and the fact that FP would have been willing to  lend funds directly to DS if not for the withholding tax are evidence  that the participation of BK in the FP-BK-FS financing arrangement is  pursuant to a tax avoidance   plan. However, other facts relevant to the presence of such a plan must  also be taken into account. Even if the director of field operations  determines that the participation of BK in the financing arrangement is  pursuant to a tax avoidance plan, BK may not be treated as a conduit  entity unless BK would not have participated in the financing  arrangement on substantially the same terms in the absence of FP's  deposit with BK. BK's right of offset against FP's deposit (a form of  guarantee of BK's loan to DS) creates a presumption that BK would not  have made the loan to DS on substantially the same terms in the absence  of FP's deposit with BK. If the taxpayer overcomes the presumption by  clear and convincing evidence, BK will not be a conduit entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FS is responsible  for coordinating the financing of all of the subsidiaries of FP, which  are engaged in substantial trades or businesses and are located in  country T, country N, and the United States. FS maintains a centralized  cash management accounting system for FP and its subsidiaries in which  it records all intercompany payables and receivables; these payables and  receivables ultimately are reduced to a single balance either due from  or owing to FS and each of FP's subsidiaries. FS is responsible for  disbursing or receiving any cash payments required by transactions  between its affiliates and unrelated parties. FS must borrow any cash  necessary to meet those external obligations and invests any excess cash  for the benefit of the FP group. FS enters into interest rate and  foreign exchange contracts as necessary to manage the risks arising from  mismatches in incoming and outgoing cash flows. The activities of FS are  intended (and reasonably can be expected) to reduce transaction costs  and overhead and other fixed costs. FS has 50 employees, including  clerical and other back office personnel, located in country T. At the  request of DS, on January 1, 1995, FS pays a supplier $1,000,000 for  materials delivered to DS and charges DS an open account receivable for  this amount. On February 3, 1995, FS reverses the account receivable  from DS to FS when DS delivers to FP goods with a value of $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)(1)</em> of this section, and the transactions  together constitute a financing arrangement within the meaning of  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. FS's activities constitute  significant financing activities with respect to the financing  transactions even though FS did not actively and materially participate  in arranging the financing transactions because the financing  transactions consisted of trade receivables and trade payables that were  ordinary and necessary to carry on the trades or businesses of DS and  the other subsidiaries of FP. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph  (b)(3)(i) of this section, FS' participation in the financing  arrangement is presumed not to be pursuant to a tax avoidance plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 22, except that, in  addition to its short-term funding needs, DS needs long-term financing  to fund an acquisition of another U.S. company; the acquisition is  scheduled to close on January 15, 1995. FS has a revolving credit  agreement with a syndicate of banks located in Country N. On January 14,  1995, FS borrows [yen]10 billion for 10 years under the revolving credit  agreement, paying yen LIBOR plus 50 basis points on a quarterly basis.  FS enters into a currency swap with BK, an unrelated bank that is not a  member of the syndicate, under which FS will pay BK [yen]10 billion and  will receive $100 million on January 15, 1995; these payments will be  reversed on January 15, 2004. FS will pay BK U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 50  basis points on a notional principal amount of $100 million semi- annually and will receive yen LIBOR plus 50 basis points on a notional  principal amount of [yen]10 billion quarterly. Upon the closing of the  acquisition on January 15, 1995, DS borrows $100 million from FS for 10  years, paying U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 50 basis points semiannually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although FS performs significant financing activities with  respect to certain financing transactions to which it is a party, FS  does not perform significant financing activities with respect to the  financing transactions between FS and the syndicate of banks and between  FS and DS because FS has eliminated all material market risks arising  from those financing transactions through its currency swap with BK.  Accordingly, the financing arrangement does not benefit from the  presumption of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and the director of  field operations must determine whether the participation of FS in the  financing arrangement is pursuant to a tax avoidance plan on the basis  of all the facts and circumstances. However, if additional facts  indicated that FS reviews its currency swaps daily to determine whether  they are the most cost efficient way of managing their currency risk  and, as a result, frequently terminates swaps in favor of entering into  more cost efficient hedging arrangements with unrelated parties, FS  would be considered to perform significant financing activities and FS'  participation in the financing arrangements would not be pursuant to a  tax avoidance plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 22, except that, on January 1,  1995, FP lends to FS DM 15,000,000 (worth $10,000,000) in exchange for a  10 year note that pays interest annually at a rate of   5 percent per annum. Also, on March 15, 1995, FS lends $10,000,000 to DS  in exchange for a 10-year note that pays interest annually at a rate of  8 percent per annum. FS would not have had sufficient funds to make the  loan to DS without the loan from FP. FS does not enter into any long- term hedging transaction with respect to these financing transactions,  but manages the interest rate and currency risk arising from the  transactions on a daily, weekly or quarterly basis by entering into  forward currency contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because FS performs significant financing activities with  respect to the financing transactions between FS, DS and FP, the  participation of FS in the financing arrangement is presumed not to be  pursuant to a tax avoidance plan. The director of field operations may  rebut this presumption by establishing that the participation of FS is  pursuant to a tax avoidance plan, based on all the facts and  circumstances. The mere fact that FS is a resident of country T is not  sufficient to establish the existence of a tax avoidance plan. However,  the existence of a plan can be inferred from other factors in addition  to the fact that FS is a resident of country T. For example, the loans  are made within a short time period and FS would not have been able to  make the loan to DS without the loan from FP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January  1, 1996, FP makes two three-year installment loans of $250,000 each to  FS that pay interest at a rate of 9 percent per annum. The loans are  self-amortizing with payments on each loan of $7,950 per month. On the  same date, FS lends $1,000,000 to DS in exchange for a two-year note  that pays interest semi-annually at a rate of 10 percent per annum,  beginning on June 30, 1996. The FS-DS loan is not self-amortizing.  Assume that for the period of January 1, 1996 through June 30, 1996, the  average principal amount of the financing transactions between FP and FS  that comprise the financing arrangement is $469,319. Further, assume  that for the period of July 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996, the  average principal amount of the financing transactions between FP and FS  is $393,632. The average principal amount of the financing transaction  between FS and DS for the same periods is $1,000,000. The director of  field operations determines that the financing transactions between FP  and FS, and FS and DS, are a conduit financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the portion of  the $50,000 interest payment made by DS to FS on June 30, 1996, that is  recharacterized as a payment to FP is $23,450 computed as follows:  ($50,000x$469,319/$1,000,000) = $23,450. The portion of the interest  payment made on December 31, 1996 that is recharacterized as a payment  to FP is $19,650, computed as follows: ($50,000x$393,632/$1,000,000) =  $19,650. Furthermore, under Sec. 1.1441-3(g), DS is liable for  withholding tax at a 30 percent rate on the portion of the $50,000  payment to FS that is recharacterized as a payment to FP, i.e., $7,035  with respect to the June 30, 1996 payment and $5,895 with respect to the  December 31, 1996 payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> FP lends DM  5,000,000 to FS in exchange for a ten year note that pays interest semi- annually at a rate of 8 percent per annum. Six months later, pursuant to  a tax avoidance plan, FS lends DM 10,000,000 to DS in exchange for a 10  year note that pays interest semi-annually at a rate of 10 percent per  annum. At the time FP make its loan to FS, the exchange rate is DM 1.5/ $1. At the time FS makes its loan to DS the exchange rate is DM 1.4/$1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FP's loan to FS and FS' loan to DS are financing transactions  and together constitute a financing arrangement. Furthermore, because  the participation of FS reduces the tax imposed under section 881 and  FS' participation is pursuant to a tax avoidance plan, the financing  arrangement is a conduit financing arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the amount  subject to recharacterization is a fraction the numerator of which is  the lowest aggregate principal amount advanced and the denominator of  which is the principal amount advanced from FS to DS. Because the  property advanced in these financing transactions is the same type of  fungible property, under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, both  are valued on the date of the last financing transaction. Accordingly,  the portion of the payments of interest that is recharacterized is ((DM  5,000,000xDM 1.4/$1)/(DM 10,000,000xDM 1.4/$1) or 0.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is effective for  payments made by financed entities on or after September 11, 1995. This  section shall not apply to interest payments covered by section  127(g)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, and to interest payments with  respect to other debt obligations issued prior to October 15, 1984  (whether or not such debt was issued by a Netherlands Antilles  corporation). Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) and Example 3 of paragraph (e) of  this section apply to payments made on or after December 9, 2011.
