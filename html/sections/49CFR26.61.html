                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In determining whether to certify a firm as eligible to  participate as a DBE, you must apply the standards of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The firm seeking certification has the burden of demonstrating  to you, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it meets the  requirements of this subpart concerning group membership or individual  disadvantage, business size, ownership, and control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must rebuttably presume that members of the designated  groups identified in Sec. 26.67(a) are socially and economically  disadvantaged. This means they do not have the burden of proving to you  that they are socially and economically disadvantaged. In order to  obtain the benefit of the rebuttable presumption, individuals must  submit a signed, notarized statement that they are a member of one of  the groups in Sec. 26.67(a). Applicants do have the obligation to  provide you information concerning their economic disadvantage (see  Sec. 26.67).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individuals who are not presumed to be socially and economically  disadvantaged, and individuals concerning whom the presumption of  disadvantage has been rebutted, have the burden of proving to you, by a  preponderance of the evidence, that they are socially and economically  disadvantaged. (See Appendix E of this part.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must make determinations concerning whether individuals and  firms have met their burden of demonstrating group membership,  ownership, control, and social and economic disadvantage (where  disadvantage must be demonstrated on an individual basis) by considering  all the facts in the record, viewed as a whole.
