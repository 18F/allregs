                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As the MRO, you normally may verify a confirmed positive test (for any drug or drug metabolite, including opiates), or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, only after interviewing the employee as provided in Sec. Sec. 40.135-40.145 . However, there are three circumstances in which you may verify such a result without an interview:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applicable, if the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the test with you. You must maintain complete documentation of this occurrence, including notation of informing, or attempting to inform, the employee of the consequences of not exercising the option to speak with the you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applicable, if the DER has successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact you and more than 72 hours have passed since the time the DER contacted the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applicable, if neither you nor the DER, after making and documenting all reasonable efforts, has been able to contact the employee within ten days of the date on which the MRO receives the confirmed test result from the laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As the MRO, you may verify an invalid test result as cancelled (with instructions to recollect immediately under direct observation) without interviewing the employee, as provided at Sec. 40.159:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the test with you;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the DER has successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact you and more than 72 hours have passed since the time the DER contacted the employee; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If neither you nor the DER, after making and documenting all reasonable efforts, has been able to contact the employee within ten days of the date on which you received the confirmed invalid test result from the laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As the MRO, after you verify a test result as a positive or as a refusal to test under this section, you must document the date and time and reason, following the instructions in Sec. 40.163. For a cancelled test due to an invalid result under this section, you must follow the instructions in Sec. 40.159(a)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As the MRO, after you have verified a test result under this section and reported the result to the DER, you must allow the employee to present information to you within 60 days of the verification to document that serious illness, injury, or other circumstances unavoidably precluded contact with the MRO and/or DER in the times provided. On the basis of such information, you may reopen the verification, allowing the employee to present information concerning whether there is a legitimate medical explanation of the confirmed test result.
