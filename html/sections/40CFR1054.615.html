Introducing these engines into U.S. commerce without a valid  exemption or certificate of conformity violates the prohibitions in 40  CFR 1068.101(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Engines exempted under this section are subject to all the  requirements affecting engines under 40 CFR part 1048, including  evaporative emission standards. The requirements and restrictions of 40  CFR part 1048 apply to anyone manufacturing these engines, anyone  manufacturing equipment that uses these engines, and all other persons  in the same manner as if these were nonroad spark-ignition engines above  19 kW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Engines exempted under this section may not generate or use  emission credits under this part 1054.</p>
