When using alternative spectra or instrumental analysis, the person must submit a spectrum or instrumental readout for the substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The estimated date (month/year) in which the person intends to submit a Premanufacture Notice (PMN) for this substance if EPA informs the notice submitter that the substance is not on the Inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The address of the facility under the control of the submitter at which the manufacture or processing of the substance would most likely occur.

In addition, a letter of support for the notice must then be sent to EPA by the chemical supplier of the confidential reactant, providing the specific chemical identity of the proprietary reactant. The letter of support must reference the manufacturer's notice. If the appropriate supporting document from the supplier is not received within 30 days after EPA receives the manufacturer's notice, the notice will be considered incomplete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> EPA will review the information submitted by the proposed manufacturer or importer under this paragraph to determine whether it has a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the chemical substance. If necessary, EPA will compare this information either to the information requested for the confidential chemical substance under Sec. 710.7(e)(2)(v) of this chapter or the information requested under Sec. 720.85(b)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the proposed manufacturer or importer has shown a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the substance, and provide sufficient unambiguous chemical identity information so

EPA can make a conclusive determination of the chemical substance's Inventory status, EPA will search the confidential Inventory and inform the proposed manufacturer or importer whether the chemical substance is on the confidential Inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the chemical substance is found on the confidential Inventory, EPA will notify the person(s) who originally reported the chemical substance that another person has demonstrated a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the substance and therefore was told that the chemical substance is on the Inventory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A disclosure of a confidential chemical identity to a person with a bona fide intent to manufacture or import the particular chemical substance will not be considered a public disclosure of confidential business information under section 14 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> EPA will answer an inquiry on whether a particular chemical substance is on the confidential Inventory within 30 days after receipt of a complete submission under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If the required chemical identity information has not been reported correctly or completely in the notice (except as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) or if any other required data or information has been omitted or is incomplete, EPA will consider the whole notice to be incomplete. As soon as an incomplete notice is identified as such by EPA, the Agency will immediately return the notice directly to the submitter. The submitter must then resubmit the whole, completed bona fide notice to EPA in order to have the Agency perform the desired Inventory search and respond to the notice.
