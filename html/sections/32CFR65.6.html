                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General eligibility. Eligibility and administration of the Post- 9/11 GI Bill are the responsibility of the VA.

Those policies and procedures are codified in 38 CFR part 21 and  presented and updated at http://www.gibill.va.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Kickers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Enlistment kickers. The use of enlistment kickers  should be based on the criticality of the skill or the length of  enlistment commitment and may be offered in amounts from $150 to $950 a  month in increments of $100.

If an individual is already eligible  for an enlistment kicker, the amount of the affiliation kicker is  limited to the amount that would take the total to $950. For those  individuals who are offered an affiliation kicker on top of an  enlistment kicker, the increases above the enlistment kicker will be in  $100 increments. Reporting codes for affiliation kickers are the same as  the codes for enlistment kickers listed in DoD Instruction 1336.05 and  DoD Manual 7730.54-M-V1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reenlistment kickers.
