                            <p class="depth0">Registration is not required under this part for warehouses and  similar places that are used by dealers merely for the storage of  liquors and that are not places where orders for liquors are accepted.  When orders for liquors are received and duly accepted at a place that  the dealer has registered under this part, the subsequent actual  delivery of the liquors from a place of storage does not require  registration at that place of storage. Except as otherwise provided in  Sec. Sec. 31.52 and 31.53, a dealer who registered a given place, and  who makes actual delivery of liquors from a warehouse at another place,  must register for the place where ownership of the liquors is  transferred if there was no prior constructive delivery by the  acceptance of an order for the liquors at the place covered by the  existing registration.</p>
