The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We will consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels (described in Sec. 416.2098) for a particular month or months after March 1983 if the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels have not been reduced below the levels in effect in March 1983 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after March 1983, the combined supplementary/SSI payment levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments), increased by any subsequent Federal SSI benefit increases, except as provided in Sec. 416.2097(b) and Sec. 416.2097(c). We will consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months between June 1977 and April 1983 if the supplementary payment levels have not been reduced below the levels in effect in December 1976 (or if a State first made supplementary payments after December 1976, the levels in effect the first month the State made supplementary payments, or in certain cases described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the levels in effect in December 1981.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will also consider a State to have met the requirements for maintaining its supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months in the period July 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, if the State had met the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section for a particular month or months in the 12-month period July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982, and, with respect to any month in the period July 1, 1982 through March 31, 1983, the State maintained the payment levels in effect in December 1981.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a State reduced any of its supplementary payment levels for a month or months within any 12-month period beginning with the effective date of a Federal benefit increase, we will consider the State to have met the requirement to maintain its supplementary payment levels if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 12 months after the relevant 12-month period, the State restores the levels retroactively; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State makes a single retroactive benefit payment to each of the beneficiaries eligible for the retroactive payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Meeting the passalong requirement--total expenditures. Exception-- The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities (see paragraph (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a State does not meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, we will consider a State to have met the requirement for maintaining supplementary payment levels for a particular month or months if total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period within which the month or months fall, beginning on the effective date of a Federal SSI benefit increase, are at least equal to the total State expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period immediately before the Federal SSI benefit increase provided that the State was in compliance for such preceding 12-month period. The combined Federal/State payment level for those persons receiving a mandatory minimum State supplementary payment can be no lower than the recipient's total income for December 1973 as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of Pub. L. 93-66.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If total State expenditures in the relevant 12-month period are less than the total expenditures in the preceding 12-month period (a ``shortfall''), we also will consider a State to have met the requirement for maintaining supplementary payment levels for the relevant 12-month period if in the following 12-month period the State increases the total expenditures required for that period by an amount at least equal to the amount of the shortfall in

the relevant 12-month period. The increased amount up to the amount needed to correct the shortfall shall be deemed to be an expenditure in the relevant 12-month period, for pass-along purposes only. (See paragraph (c)(5) of this section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> Exception for the 6-month period from July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983: We will consider the State to have met the total-expenditures requirement for the 6-month period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Exception for the 6-month period from July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983: We will consider the State to have met the total-expenditures requirement for the 6-month period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, equal or exceed the total of such expenditures for the period July l, 1982 through December 31, 1982;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period January 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983, equal or exceed the total of such expenditures for the period January 1, 1982 through December 31, 1982; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Total expenditures for State supplementary payments for the period July 1, 1983 through December 31, 1983 equal or exceed one-half of the total of such expenditures for the period July 1, 1982 through June 30, 1983. The provisions of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section and of Sec. 416.2099 (b), (c), and (d) shall apply to this 6-month period in the same manner as they apply to the 12-month periods referred to therein.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1981: If a State did not meet the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, we will consider a State to have met the maintenance-of-supplementary-payment-levels requirement for this 12-month period if the State's expenditures for supplementary payments in that period were at least equal to its expenditures for such payments for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1977 (or, if the State made no supplementary payments in that period, the expenditures for the first 12-month period ending June 30 in which the State made such payments); if a State made additional State supplementary payments during the period July 1, 1981 through June 30, 1982, in order to make up a shortfall in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1981 (determined by a comparison with the preceding 12-month period) which later resulted in an excess payment (determined by comparison with the 12-month period July 1, 1976 through June 30, 1977) we will credit the State with the amount of the excess payments if the State so requests. This credit will be applied to any shortfall(s) in total expenditures (should one exist) in any period(s) ending on or before December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Total State expenditures for supplementary payments are the State's total payments for both mandatory minimum and optional State supplementary payments in the appropriate 12-month period less any amounts deemed to be expenditures for another 12-month period under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, less the amount of any payments recovered and other adjustments made in that period. Total State expenditures do not include State administrative expenses, interim assistance payments, vendor payments, or payments made under other Federal programs, such as titles IV, XIX, or XX of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Adjustments in total State supplementary payments made after the expiration of the relevant 12-month period for purposes of meeting total State expenditures under paragraph (c) of this section shall be considered a State expenditure in the relevant 12-month period only for purposes of the pass-along requirement. For purposes of Sec. 416.2090 of this part, which discusses the rules for limitation on fiscal liability of States (hold harmless), these retroactive adjustments are State expenditures when made and shall be counted as a State expenditure in the fiscal year in which the adjustments are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To determine whether a State's expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of SSI benefits are not less than the State's expenditures for the payments in the preceding 12-month period, in computing the State's expenditures, we disregard, pursuant to a one-time election of the State, all expenditures by the State for the retroactive supplementary payments that

are required to be made under the Sullivan v. Zebley, 493 U.S. 521 (1990) class action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payments to residents to Medicaid facilities. A Medicaid facility is a medical care facility where Medicaid pays more than 50 percent of the cost of a person's care. In order to be eligible to receive Medicaid reimbursement, any State that has a supplementary payment level for residents of Medicaid facilities on or after October 1, 1987, must have in effect an agreement with the Commissioner to maintain such supplementary payment level at least equal to the October 1987 level (or if a State first makes such supplementary payments after October 1, 1987, but before July 1, 1988, the level for the first month the State makes such supplementary payments).
