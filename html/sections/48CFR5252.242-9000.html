                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 5242.9000 insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Refunds (Spares and Support Equipment) (DEC 1986)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the event that the price of a spare part or item of support equipment delivered under this contract significantly exceeds its intrinsic value, the contractor agrees to refund the difference. Refunds will only be made for the difference between the intrinsic value of the item at the time an agreement on price was reached and the contract price. Refunds will not be made to recoup the amount of cost decreases that occur over time due to productivity gains (beyond economic purchase quantity considerations) or changes in market conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this clause, the intrinsic value of an item is defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the item is one which is sold, or is substantially similar or functionally equivalent to one that is sold in substantial quantities to the general public, intrinsic value is the established catalog or market price, plus the value of any unique requirements, including delivery terms, inspection, packaging, or labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is no comparable item sold in substantial quantities to the general public, intrinsic value is defined as the price an individual would expect to pay for the item based upon an economic quantity as defined in FAR 52.207-4, plus the value of any unique requirements, including delivery terms, inspection, packaging, or labeling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At any time up to two years after delivery of a space part or item of support equipment, the contracting officer may notify the contractor that based on all information available at the time of the notice, the price of the part or item apparently exceeds its intrinsic value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If notified in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contractor agrees to enter into good faith negotiations with the Government to determine if, and in what amount, the Government is entitled to a refund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If agreement pursuant to paragraph (d) of this clause, cannot be reached, and the Navy's return of the new or unused item to the contractor is practical, the Navy, subject to the contractor's agreement, may elect to return the item to the contractor. Upon return of the item to its original point of government acceptance, the contractor shall refund in full the price paid. If no agreement pursuant to paragraph (d) of this clause is reached, and return of the item by the Navy is impractical, the contracting officer may, with the approval of the Head of the Contracting Activity, issue a contracting officer's final decision on the matter, subject to contractor appeal as provided in the Disputes clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The contractor will make refunds, as required under this clause, in accordance with instructions from the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The contractor shall not be liable for a refund if the contractor advised the contracting officer in a timely manner that the price it would propose for a spare part or item of support equipment exceeded its intrinsic value, and with such advice, specified the estimated proposed price, the estimated intrinsic value, and known alternative sources or items, if any, that can meet the requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> This clause does not apply to any spare parts or items of support equipment whose price is determined through adequate price competition. This clause also does not apply to any spare part or item of support equipment with a unit price in excess of $100,000; or in excess of $25,000 if the contractor submitted, and certified the currency, accuracy and completeness of, cost or pricing data applicable to the item.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
