                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The operator shall conduct operations in a manner which protects the mineral resources, other natural resources, and environmental quality. In that respect, the operator shall comply with the pertinent orders of the authorized officer and other standards and procedures as set forth in the applicable laws, regulations, lease terms and conditions, and the approved drilling plan or subsequent operations plan. Before approving any Application for Permit to Drill submitted pursuant to Sec. 3162.3-1 of this title, or other plan requiring environmental review, the authorized officer shall prepare an environmental record of review or an environmental assessment, as appropriate. These environmental documents will be used in determining whether or not an environmental impact statement is required and in determining any appropriate terms and conditions of approval of the submitted plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The operator shall exercise due care and diligence to assure that leasehold operations do not result in undue damage to surface or subsurface resources or surface improvements. All produced water must be disposed of by injection into the subsurface, by approved pits, or by other methods which have been approved by the authorized officer. Upon the conclusion of operations, the operator shall reclaim the disturbed surface in a manner approved or reasonably prescribed by the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All spills or leakages of oil, gas, produced water, toxic liquids, or waste materials, blowouts, fires, personal injuries, and fatalities shall be reported by the operator in accordance with these regulations and as prescribed in

applicable order or notices. The operator shall exercise due diligence in taking necessary measures, subject to approval by the authorized officer, to control and remove pollutants and to extinguish fires. An operator's compliance with the requirements of the regulations in this part shall not relieve the operator of the obligation to comply with other applicable laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> When reasonably required by the authorized officer, a contingency plan shall be submitted describing procedures to be implemented to protect life, property, and the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The operator's liability for damages to third parties shall be governed by applicable law.

The operator shall take all necessary precautions to keep each well under control at all times, and shall utilize and maintain materials and equipment necessary to insure the safety of operating conditions and procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Vertical drilling. The operator shall conduct drilling operations in a manner so that the completed well does not deviate significantly from the vertical without the prior written approval of the authorized officer. Significant deviation means a projected deviation of the well bore from the vertical of 10[deg] or more, or a projected bottom hole location which could be less than 200 feet from the spacing unit or lease boundary. Any well which deviates more than 10[deg] from the vertical or could result in a bottom hole location less than 200 feet from the spacing unit or lease boundary without prior written approval must be promptly reported to the authorized officer. In these cases, a directional survey is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> High pressure or loss of circulation. The operator shall take immediate steps and utilize necessary resources to maintain or restore control of any well in which the pressure equilibrium has become unbalanced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Protection of usable water and other minerals. The operator must isolate all usable water and other mineral-bearing formations and protect them from contamination. Tests and surveys of the effectiveness of such measures shall be conducted by the operator using procedures and practices approved or prescribed by the authorized officer.
