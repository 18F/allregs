One means of implementing this policy is to give employees adversely affected by closure of a military installation the right of first refusal for jobs created by award of contracts arising from the closure effort that the employee is qualified to fill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Closure efforts include the acquisitions for preparing the installation for closure (such as environmental restoration and utilities modification) and maintaining the property after closure (such as security and fire prevention services).</p>
