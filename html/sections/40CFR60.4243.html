You must also meet  the requirements as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subparts A through D,  as they apply to you. If you adjust engine settings according to and  consistent with the manufacturer's instructions, your stationary SI  internal combustion engine will not be considered out of compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal  combustion engine less than 100 HP, you must keep a maintenance plan and  records of conducted maintenance to demonstrate compliance and must, to  the extent practicable, maintain and operate the engine in a manner  consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing  emissions, but no performance testing is required if you are an owner or  operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you are an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal  combustion engine greater than or equal to 100 HP and less than or equal  to 500 HP, you must keep a maintenance plan and records of conducted  maintenance and must, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate  the engine in a manner consistent with good air pollution control  practice for minimizing emissions. In addition, you must conduct an  initial performance test within 1 year of engine startup to demonstrate  compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If you are an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal  combustion engine greater than 500 HP, you must keep a maintenance plan  and records of conducted maintenance and must, to the extent  practicable, maintain and operate the engine in a manner consistent with  good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. In  addition, you must conduct an initial performance test within 1 year of  engine startup and conduct subsequent performance testing every 8,760  hours or 3 years, whichever comes first, thereafter to demonstrate  compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> and (2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchasing an engine certified according to procedures specified  in this subpart, for the same model year and demonstrating compliance  according to one of the methods specified in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal  combustion engine greater than 25 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP,  you must keep a maintenance plan and records of conducted maintenance  and must, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the engine in  a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for  minimizing emissions.

The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for  approval of additional hours to be used for maintenance checks and  readiness testing, but a petition is not required if the owner or  operator maintains records indicating that federal, state, or local  standards require maintenance and testing of emergency ICE beyond 100  hours per calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Emergency stationary ICE may be operated for emergency demand  response for periods in which the Reliability Coordinator under the  North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability  Standard EOP-002-3, Capacity and Energy Emergencies (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 60.17), or other authorized entity as determined by  the Reliability Coordinator, has declared an Energy Emergency Alert  Level 2 as defined in the NERC Reliability Standard EOP-002-3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Emergency stationary ICE may be operated for periods where  there is a deviation of voltage or frequency of 5 percent or greater  below standard voltage or frequency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> of this section, the 50 hours per year for non- emergency situations cannot be used for peak shaving or non-emergency  demand response, or to generate income for a facility to an electric  grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with  another entity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations can be used  to supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity  if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or  local   transmission and distribution system operator;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or  distribution limitations so as to avert potential voltage collapse or  line overloads that could lead to the interruption of power supply in a  local area or region.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The dispatch follows reliability, emergency operation or similar  protocols that follow specific NERC, regional, state, public utility  commission or local standards or guidelines.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support  the local transmission and distribution system.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The owner or operator identifies and records the entity that  dispatches the engine and the specific NERC, regional, state, public  utility commission or local standards or guidelines that are being  followed for dispatching the engine.

If propane is used for more than 100 hours per  year in an engine that is not certified to the emission standards when  using propane, the owners and operators are required to conduct a  performance test to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards  of Sec. 60.4233.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you are an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal  combustion engine that is less than or equal to 500 HP and you purchase  a non-certified engine or you do not operate and maintain your certified  stationary SI internal combustion engine and control device according to  the manufacturer's written emission-related instructions, you are  required to perform initial performance testing as indicated in this  section, but you are not required to conduct subsequent performance  testing unless the stationary engine is rebuilt or undergoes major  repair or maintenance. A rebuilt stationary SI ICE means an engine that  has been rebuilt as that term is defined in 40 CFR 94.11(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> It is expected that air-to-fuel ratio controllers will be used  with the operation of three-way catalysts/non-selective catalytic  reduction. The AFR controller must be maintained and operated  appropriately in order to ensure proper operation of the engine and  control device to minimize emissions at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchasing an engine certified according to 40 CFR part 1048.  The engine must be installed and configured according to the  manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Keeping records of performance test results for each pollutant  for a test conducted on a similar engine. The test must have been  conducted using the same methods specified in this subpart and these  methods must have been followed correctly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Keeping records of engine manufacturer data indicating  compliance with the standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Keeping records of control device vendor data indicating  compliance with the standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)(1)</em> or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchasing, or otherwise owning or operating, an engine  certified to the emission standards in Sec. 60.4233(f), as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conducting a performance test to demonstrate initial compliance  with the emission standards according to the requirements specified in  Sec. 60.4244.
