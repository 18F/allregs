                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved GAP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing GAP or require a revision to your GAP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved GAP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your GAP. If the review indicates that the GAP should be revised to meet the requirement of this part, we will require you to submit the needed revisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Activities for which a proposed revision to your GAP will likely be necessary include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Activities not described in your approved GAP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Change in the surface location of a facility or structure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Addition of a facility or structure not contemplated in your approved GAP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Change in the location of your onshore support base from one State to another or to a new base requiring expansion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Changes in the locations of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains, etc.) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations. If a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Structural failure of one or more facilities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Change to any other activity specified by BOEM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and any relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require any additional Federal authorizations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Otherwise consistent with the provisions of subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act.</p>
