Bids offering ``equal'' products (including products of  the brand   name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be  considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids  and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient  characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder  is offering an ``equal'' product, the bid shall be considered as  offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the bidder proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the  brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in  the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be  otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the  determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the  responsibility of the Government and will be based on information  furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other  information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO  BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or  securing any information that is not identified in the bid and  reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure  that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a  part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts,  illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the  purchasing activity to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine whether the product offered meets the salient  characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what  the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award.  The information furnished may include specific references to information  previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the  purchasing activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it  conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed  modifications, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed  modifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product  conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids  will not be considered.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)</p>
