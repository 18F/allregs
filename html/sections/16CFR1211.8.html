                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A secondary entrapment protection device supplied with, or as an accessory to, an operator shall consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An external photoelectric sensor that when activated results in an operator that is closing a door to reverse direction of the door and the sensor prevents an operator from closing an open door,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An external edge sensor installed on the edge of the door that, when activated results in an operator that is closing a door to reverse direction of

the door and the sensor prevents an operator from closing an open door,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An inherent door sensor independent of the system used to comply with Sec. 1211.7 that, when activated, results in an operator that is closing a door to reverse direction of the door and the sensor prevents an operator from closing an open door, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other external or internal device that provides entrapment protection equivalent to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to paragraph (a) of this section, the operator shall monitor for the presence and correct operation of the device, including the wiring to it, at least once during each close cycle. In the event the device is not present or a fault condition occurs which precludes the sensing of an obstruction, including an open or short circuit in the wiring that connects an external entrapment protection device to the operator and device's supply source, the operator shall be constructed such that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A closing door shall open and an open door shall not close more than 1 foot (305 mm) below the upmost position, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The operator shall function as required by Sec. 1211.6(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An external entrapment protection device shall comply with the applicable requirements in Sec. Sec. 1211.10, 1211.11 and 1211.12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An inherent secondary entrapment protection device shall comply with the applicable requirements in Sec. 1211.13. Software used in an inherent entrapment protection device shall comply with the Standard for Safety for Software in Programmable Components, UL 1998, Second Edition, May 29, 1998.
