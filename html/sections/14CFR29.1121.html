Each exhaust system component must be separated by a fireproof shield from adjacent parts of the rotorcraft that are outside the engine and auxiliary power unit compartments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No exhaust gases may discharge so as to cause a fire hazard with respect to any flammable fluid vent or drain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No exhaust gases may discharge where they will cause a glare seriously affecting pilot vision at night.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each exhaust system component must be ventilated to prevent points of excessively high temperature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each exhaust shroud must be ventilated or insulated to avoid, during normal operation, a temperature high enough to ignite any flammable fluids or vapors outside the shroud.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If significant traps exist, each turbine engine exhaust system must have drains discharging clear of the rotorcraft, in any normal ground and flight attitudes, to prevent fuel accumulation after the failure of an attempted engine start.
