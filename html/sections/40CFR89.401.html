The

exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow (raw analysis), and the power output during each mode. Emissions are reported as grams per kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for emission test equipment and calibrating this equipment are found in subpart D of this part.
