                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets under subparts D  and E of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The offsetting transaction must be identified by the CCP as a  transaction for the clearing member client.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The collateral supporting the transaction must be held in a  manner that prevents the Board-regulated institution from facing any  loss due to an event of default, including from a liquidation,  receivership, insolvency, or similar proceeding of either the clearing  member or the clearing member's other clients. Omnibus accounts  established under 17 CFR parts 190 and 300 satisfy the requirements of  this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Board-regulated institution must conduct sufficient legal  review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient  written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal  challenge (including one resulting from a default or receivership,  insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding) the relevant court and  administrative authorities would find the arrangements of paragraph  (a)(2) of this section to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under  the law of the relevant jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The offsetting transaction with a clearing member must be  transferable under the transaction documents and applicable laws in the  relevant jurisdiction(s) to another clearing member should the clearing  member default, become insolvent, or enter receivership, insolvency,  liquidation, or similar proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible margin loan. In order to recognize an exposure as an  eligible margin loan as defined in Sec. 217.2, a Board-regulated  institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a  well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of  that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of the definition  of eligible margin loan in Sec. 217.2, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law  in the relevant jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualifying cross-product master netting agreement. In order to  recognize an agreement as a qualifying cross-product master netting  agreement as defined in Sec. 217.101, a Board-regulated institution  must obtain a written legal opinion verifying the validity and  enforceability of the agreement under applicable law of the relevant  jurisdictions if the counterparty fails to perform upon an event of  default, including upon receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or  similar proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Qualifying master netting agreement. In order to recognize an  agreement as a qualifying master netting agreement as defined in Sec.  217.2, a Board-regulated institution must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded  basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of that legal  review) that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agreement meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of the  definition of qualifying master netting agreement in Sec. 217.2; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from  default or from receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar  proceeding) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find  the agreement to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the law  of the relevant jurisdictions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish and maintain written procedures to monitor possible  changes in relevant law and to ensure that the agreement continues to  satisfy the requirements of the definition of qualifying master netting  agreement in Sec. 217.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Repo-style transaction. In order to recognize an exposure as a  repo-style transaction as defined in Sec. 217.2, a Board-regulated  institution must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a  well-founded basis (and maintain sufficient written documentation of  that legal review) that the agreement underlying the exposure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of the definition of  repo-style transaction in Sec. 217.2, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under applicable law  in the relevant jurisdictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure of a QCCP to satisfy the rule's requirements. If a  Board-regulated institution determines that a CCP ceases to be a QCCP  due to the failure of the CCP to satisfy one or more of the requirements  set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a  QCCP in Sec. 217.2, the Board-regulated institution may continue to  treat the CCP as a QCCP for up to three months following the  determination. If the CCP fails to remedy the relevant deficiency within  three months after the initial determination, or the CCP fails to  satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii)  of the definition of a QCCP continuously for a three-month period after  remedying the relevant deficiency, a Board-regulated institution may not  treat the CCP as a QCCP for the purposes of this part until after the  Board-regulated institution has determined that the CCP has satisfied  the requirements in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition  of a QCCP for three continuous months.    Sec. Sec. 217.4-217.9  [Reserved]</p>
