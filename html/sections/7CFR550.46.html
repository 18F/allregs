                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to  provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The  Cooperator shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as  well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or  eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure  objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive  advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications,  requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests  for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements.  Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is  responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the  Cooperator, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations  shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offer shall  fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the Cooperator.  Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the  Cooperator's interest to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who  possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms  and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given  to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance,  financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary  resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are  restricted by agencies' implementation of Executive Orders 12549   and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recipients shall, on request, make available for the REE Agency,  pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for  proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc.</p>
