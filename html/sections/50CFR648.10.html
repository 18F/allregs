As a condition to obtaining a limited access scallop,  multispecies, an Atlantic herring, a surfclam, ocean quahog, or Maine  mahogany quahog permit; or as a condition of using a VMS unit; all  vessel owners must allow NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized officers  or designees access to the vessel's DAS data, if applicable, and to  location data obtained from its VMS   unit, if required, at the time of or after its transmission to the  vendor or receiver, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tampering. Tampering with a VMS, a VMS unit, or a VMS signal, is  prohibited. Tampering includes any activity that may affect the unit's  ability to operate or signal properly, or to accurately compute or  report the vessel's position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fishery participation notification. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A vessel subject to the  VMS requirements of Sec. 648.9 and paragraphs (b) through (d) of this  section that has crossed the VMS Demarcation Line under paragraph (a) of  this section is deemed to be fishing under the DAS program, the Access  Area Program, the LAGC IFQ or NGOM scallop fishery, or other fishery  requiring the operation of VMS as applicable, unless prior to leaving  port, the vessel's owner or authorized representative declares the  vessel out of the scallop, NE multispecies, or monkfish fishery, as  applicable, for a specific time period. NMFS must be notified by  transmitting the appropriate VMS code through the VMS, or unless the  vessel's owner or authorized representative declares the vessel will be  fishing in the Eastern U.S./Canada Area, as described in  Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii), under the provisions of that program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notification that the vessel is not under the DAS program, the  Access Area Program, the LAGC IFQ or NGOM scallop fishery, or any other  fishery requiring the operation of VMS, must be received by NMFS prior  to the vessel leaving port. A vessel may not change its status after the  vessel leaves port or before it returns to port on any fishing trip,  unless the vessel is a scallop vessel and is exempted, as specified in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> DAS counting for a vessel that is under the VMS notification  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, with the exception of  vessels that have elected to fish exclusively in the Eastern U.S./Canada  Area on a particular trip, as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this  section, begins with the first location signal received showing that the  vessel crossed the VMS Demarcation Line after leaving port. DAS counting  ends with the first location signal received showing that the vessel  crossed the VMS Demarcation Line upon its return to port, unless the  vessel is declared into a limited access scallop DAS trip and, upon its  return to port, declares out of the scallop fishery shoreward of the VMS  Demarcation Line at or south of 39 N. lat., as specified in paragraph  (f)(6) of this section, and lands in a port south of 39 N. lat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For those vessels that have elected to fish exclusively in the  Eastern U.S./Canada Area pursuant to Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii), the  requirements of this paragraph (b) begin with the first location signal  received showing that the vessel crossed into the Eastern U.S./Canada  Area and end with the first location signal received showing that the  vessel crossed out of the Eastern U.S./Canada Area upon beginning its  return trip to port, unless the vessel elects to also fish outside the  Eastern U.S./Canada Area on the same trip, in accordance with  Sec. 648.85(a)(3)(ii)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Regional Administrator may authorize or require the use of  the call-in system instead of the use of VMS, as described under  paragraph (h) of this section. Furthermore, the Regional Administrator  may authorize or require the use of letters of authorization as an  alternative means of enforcing possession limits, if VMS cannot be used  for such purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Atlantic sea scallop vessel VMS notification requirements. Less  than 1 hr prior to leaving port, the owner or authorized representative  of a scallop vessel that is required to use VMS as specified in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section must notify the Regional Administrator  by transmitting the appropriate VMS code that the vessel will be  participating in the scallop DAS program, Area Access Program, LAGC  scallop fishery, or will be fishing outside of the scallop fishery under  the requirements of its other Federal permits, or that the vessel will  be steaming to another location prior to commencing its fishing trip by  transmitting a ``declared out of fishery'' VMS code. If the owner or  authorized representative of a scallop vessel declares out of the  fishery for the steaming portion of the trip, the vessel cannot possess,  retain, or land scallops, or fish for any other fish. Prior to  commencing the fishing trip following a ``declared out of fishery''   trip, the owner or authorized representative must notify the Regional  Administrator by transmitting the appropriate VMS code, before first  crossing the VMS Demarcation Line, that the vessel will be participating  in the scallop DAS program, Area Access Program, or LAGC scallop  fishery. VMS codes and instructions are available from the Regional  Administrator upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> IFQ scallop vessels. An IFQ scallop vessel that has crossed the  VMS Demarcation Line specified under paragraph (a) of this section is  deemed to be fishing under the IFQ program, unless prior to the vessel  leaving port, the vessel's owner or authorized representative declares  the vessel out of the scallop fishery by notifying the Regional  Administrator through the VMS. If the vessel has not fished for any fish  (i.e., steaming only), after declaring out of the fishery, leaving port,  and steaming to another location, the owner or authorized representative  of an IFQ scallop vessel may declare into the IFQ fishery without  entering another port by making a declaration before first crossing the  VMS Demarcation Line. An IFQ scallop vessel that is fishing north of  4220 N. lat. is deemed to be fishing under the NGOM scallop fishery  unless prior to the vessel leaving port, the vessel's owner or  authorized representative declares the vessel out of the scallop  fishery, as specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.  After declaring out of the fishery, leaving port, and steaming to  another location, if the IFQ scallop vessel has not fished for any fish  (i.e., steaming only), the vessel may declare into the NGOM fishery  without entering another port by making a declaration before first  crossing the VMS Demarcation Line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> NGOM scallop fishery. A NGOM scallop vessel is deemed to be  fishing in Federal waters of the NGOM management area and will have its  landings applied against the NGOM management area TAC, specified in  Sec. 648.62(b)(1), unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> and (ii) of this section,  and the vessel does not possess, retain, or land scallops while under  such a declaration. After declaring out of the fishery, leaving port,  and steaming to another location, if the NGOM scallop vessel has not  fished for any other fish (i.e., steaming only), the vessel may declare  into the NGOM fishery without entering another port by making a  declaration before first crossing the VMS Demarcation Line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The vessel has specifically declared into the state-only NGOM  fishery, thus is fishing exclusively in the state waters portion of the  NGOM management area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incidental scallop fishery. An Incidental scallop vessel that  has crossed the VMS Demarcation Line on any declared fishing trip for  any species is deemed to be fishing under the Incidental scallop  fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Catch reports. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of a limited access or  LAGC IFQ vessel that fishes for, possesses, or retains scallops, and is  not fishing under a NE Multispecies DAS or sector allocation, must  submit reports through the VMS, in accordance with instructions to be  provided by the Regional Administrator, for each day fished, including  open area trips, access area trips as described in Sec. 648.60(a)(9),  and trips accompanied by a NMFS-approved observer. The reports must be  submitted for each day (beginning at 0000 hr and ending at 2400 hr) and  not later than 0900 hr of the following day. Such reports must include  the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> VTR serial number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Date fish were caught;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Total pounds of scallop meats kept;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Total pounds of all fish kept.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Scallop Pre-Landing Notification Form for IFQ and NGOM vessels.  A vessel issued an IFQ or NGOM scallop permit must report through VMS,  using the Scallop Pre-Landing Notification Form, the amount of any  scallops kept on each trip declared as a scallop trip, including  declared scallop trips where no scallops were landed. In addition,  vessels with an IFQ or NGOM permit must submit a Scallop Pre-Landing  Notification Form on trips that are not declared as scallop trips, but  on which   scallops are kept incidentally. A limited access vessel that also holds  an IFQ or NGOM permit must submit the Scallop Pre-Landing Notification  Form only when fishing under the provisions of the vessel's IFQ or NGOM  permit. VMS Scallop Pre-Landing Notification forms must be submitted no  less than 6 hours prior to arrival, or, if fishing ends less than 6  hours before arrival, immediately after fishing ends. If scallops will  be landed, the report must include the vessel operator's permit number,  the amount of scallop meats in pounds to be landed, the number of  bushels of in-shell scallops to be landed, the estimated time of arrival  in port, the landing port and state where the scallops will be  offloaded, the VTR serial number recorded from that trip's VTR (the same  VTR serial number as reported to the dealer), and whether any scallops  were caught in the NGOM. If no scallops will be landed, a vessel issued  an IFQ or NGOM scallop permit must provide only the vessel's captain/ operator's permit number, the VTR serial number recorded from that  trip's VTR (the same VTR serial number as reported to the dealer), and  confirmation that no scallops will be landed.
