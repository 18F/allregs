                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agreements. The Exchange must enter into agreements with agencies administering Medicaid, CHIP, and the BHP, if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange, as are necessary to fulfill the requirements of this subpart and provide copies of any such agreements to HHS upon request. Such agreements must include a clear delineation of the responsibilities of each agency to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Minimize burden on individuals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure prompt determinations of eligibility and enrollment in the appropriate program without undue delay, based on the date the application is submitted to or redetermination is initiated by the Exchange or the agency administering Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ensure compliance with paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibilities related to individuals potentially eligible for Medicaid based on other information or through other coverage groups. For an applicant who is not eligible for Medicaid based on the standards specified in Sec. 155.305(c), the Exchange must assess the information provided by the applicant on his or her application to determine whether he or she is potentially eligible for Medicaid based on factors not otherwise considered in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Individuals requesting additional screening. The Exchange must notify an applicant of the opportunity to request a full determination of eligibility for Medicaid based on eligibility criteria that are not described in Sec. 155.305(c), and provide such an opportunity. The Exchange must also make such notification to an enrollee and provide an enrollee such opportunity in any determination made in accordance with Sec. 155.330 or Sec. 155.335.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notification of applicant and State Medicaid agency. If an Exchange identifies an applicant as potentially eligible for Medicaid under paragraph (b) of this section or an applicant requests a full determination for Medicaid under paragraph (c) of this section, the Exchange must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transmit all information provided on the application and any information obtained or verified by, the Exchange to the State Medicaid agency, promptly and without undue delay; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify the applicant of such transmittal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of referrals to Medicaid on eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions. The Exchange must consider an applicant who is described in paragraph (d) of this section and has not been determined eligible for Medicaid based on the standards specified in Sec. 155.305(c) as ineligible for Medicaid for purposes of eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit or cost-sharing reductions until the State Medicaid agency notifies the Exchange that the applicant is eligible for Medicaid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special rule. If the Exchange verifies that a tax filer's household income, as defined in 26 CFR 1.36B-1(e), is less than 100 percent of the FPL for the benefit year for which coverage is requested, determines that the tax filer is not eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit based on Sec. 155.305(f)(2), and one or more applicants in the tax filer's household has been determined ineligible for Medicaid and CHIP based on income, the Exchange must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the applicant with any information regarding income used in the Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Follow the procedures specified in Sec. 155.320(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Determination of eligibility for individuals submitting applications directly to an agency administering Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP. The Exchange, in consultation with the agency or agencies administering Medicaid, CHIP, and the

BHP if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange, must establish procedures to ensure that an eligibility determination for enrollment in a QHP, advance payments of the premium tax credit, and cost-sharing reductions is performed when an application is submitted directly to an agency administering Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange. Under such procedures, the Exchange must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accept, via secure electronic interface, all information provided on the application and any information obtained or verified by, the agency administering Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP, if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange, for the individual, and not require submission of another application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify such agency of the receipt of the information described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and final eligibility determination for enrollment in a QHP, advance payments of the premium tax credit, and cost-sharing reductions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not duplicate any eligibility and verification findings already made by the transmitting agency, to the extent such findings are made in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Not request information or documentation from the individual already provided to another agency administering an insurance affordability program and included in the transmission of information provided on the application or other information transmitted from the other agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determine the individual's eligibility for enrollment in a QHP, advance payments of the premium tax credit, and cost-sharing reductions, promptly and without undue delay, and in accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Follow a streamlined process for eligibility determinations regardless of the agency that initially received an application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Adherence to state decision regarding Medicaid and CHIP. The Exchange and the Exchange appeals entity must adhere to the eligibility determination or appeals decision for Medicaid or CHIP made by the State Medicaid or CHIP agency, or the appeals entity for such agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Standards for sharing information between the Exchange and the agencies administering Medicaid, CHIP, and the BHP. (1) The Exchange must utilize a secure electronic interface to exchange data with the agencies administering Medicaid, CHIP, and the BHP, if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange, including to verify whether an applicant for insurance affordability programs has been determined eligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP, as specified in Sec. 155.320(b)(1)(ii), and for other functions required under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Exchange must utilize a secure electronic interface to exchange data with the agencies administering Medicaid, CHIP, and the BHP, if a BHP is operating in the service area of the Exchange, including to verify whether an applicant for insurance affordability programs has been determined eligible for Medicaid, CHIP, or the BHP, as specified in Sec. 155.320(b)(1)(ii), and for other functions required under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Model agreements.
