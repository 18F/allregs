In any event, the peak  EIRP power density shall not exceed 1 Watt in any one-megahertz slice of  spectrum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section,  transmitters operating in the 3650-3700 MHz band that emit multiple  directional beams, simultaneously or sequentially, for the purpose of  directing signals to individual receivers or to groups of receivers  provided the emissions comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Different information must be transmitted to each receiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the transmitter employs an antenna system that emits multiple  directional beams but does not emit multiple directional beams  simultaneously, the total output power conducted to the array or arrays  that comprise the device, i.e., the sum of the power supplied to all  antennas, antenna elements, staves, etc. and summed across all carriers  or frequency channels, shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph  (a) of this section, as applicable. The directional antenna gain shall  be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The directional gain, in dBi, shall be calculated as the sum of  10 log (number of array elements or staves) plus the directional gain,  in dBi, of the individual element or stave having the highest gain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A lower value for the directional gain than that calculated in  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will be accepted if sufficient  evidence is presented, e.g., due to shading of the array or coherence  loss in the beam-forming.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a transmitter employs an antenna that operates simultaneously  on multiple directional beams using the same or different frequency  channels and if transmitted beams overlap, the power shall be reduced to  ensure that the aggregate power from the overlapping beams does not  exceed the limit specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In  addition, the aggregate power   transmitted simultaneously on all beams shall not exceed the limit  specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by more than 8 dB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transmitters that emit a single directional beam shall operate  under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mobile and portable stations are limited to 1 watt/25 MHz EIRP.
