                                Sec. 102.25  Responsibility for responding to requests for access
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, the office that first receives a  request for access to a record, and has possession of that record, is  the office responsible for responding to the request. That office shall  acknowledge receipt of the request not later than 10 days (excluding  Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt  of the request in writing. In determining which records are responsive  to a request, an office ordinarily shall include only those records in  its possession as of the date the office begins its search for them. If  any other date is used, the office shall inform the requester of that  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority to grant or deny requests. The Program/Support Office  Head, or designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for access  to a record of that office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consultations and referrals. When an office receives a request  for access to a record in its possession, it shall determine whether  another office, or another agency of the Federal Government, is better  able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under the  Privacy Act. If the receiving office determines that it is best able to  process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If  the receiving office determines that it is not best able to process the  record, then it shall either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting  with the office or agency best able to determine whether the record is  exempt from access and with any other office or agency that has a  substantial interest in it; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the  office best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access  or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency  is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily the office or agency that  originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine  whether it is exempt from access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Law enforcement information. Whenever a request is made for  access to a record containing information that relates to an  investigation of a possible violation of law and that was originated by  SBA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or another agency, the  receiving office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the  request regarding that information to either SBA's OIG or the other  agency ``depending on where the investigation originated.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Classified information. Whenever a request is made for access to  a record containing information that has been classified by or may be  appropriate for classification by another office or agency under  Executive Order 12958 or any other executive order concerning the  classification of records, the receiving office shall refer the  responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information  to the office or agency that classified the information, should consider  the information for classification, or has the primary interest in it,  as appropriate. Whenever a record contains information that has been  derivatively classified by an office   because it contains information classified by another office or agency,  the office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request  regarding that information to the office or agency that classified the  underlying information. Information determined to no longer require  classification shall not be withheld from a requester on the basis of  Exemption (k)(1) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of referral. Whenever an office refers all or any part of  the responsibility for responding to a request to another office or  agency, it shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the  requester of the name of each office or agency to which the request has  been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and  referrals shall be processed according to the date the access request  was initially received by the first office or agency, not any later  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Offices may  make agreements with other offices or agencies to eliminate the need for  consultations or referrals for particular types of records.</p>
