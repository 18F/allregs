                                Sec. 170.220  What is the Population Adjustment Factor?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Population Adjustment Factor (PAF) is a special portion of the total IRR Program distribution calculated annually that provides for broader participation in the IRR Program by tribes (or a governmental subdivision of a tribe authorized to administer the tribe's IRR Program funding). The PAF is based upon the population ranges and distribution factors in appendix B to subpart C. The population data used is the American Indian and Alaska Native Service Population developed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA), (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.). Appendix B to subpart C explains how the PAF is derived. The funds generated by the PAF can be used for transportation planning or IRR projects.</p>
