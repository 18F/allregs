                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Promotion work is one type of activity often performed by  persons who make sales, which may or may not be exempt outside sales  work, depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed.  Promotional work that is actually performed incidental to and in  conjunction with an employee's own outside sales or solicitations is  exempt work. On the other hand, promotional work that is incidental to  sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not exempt outside sales  work. An employee who does not satisfy the requirements of this subpart  may still qualify as an exempt employee under other subparts of this  rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A manufacturer's representative, for example, may perform  various types of promotional activities such as putting up displays and  posters, removing damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant's shelves  or rearranging the merchandise. Such an employee can be considered an  exempt outside sales employee if the employee's primary duty is making  sales or contracts. Promotion activities directed toward consummation of  the employee's own sales are exempt. Promotional activities designed to  stimulate sales that will be made by someone else are not exempt outside  sales work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Another example is a company representative who visits chain  stores, arranges the merchandise on shelves, replenishes stock by  replacing old with new merchandise, sets up displays and consults with  the store manager when inventory runs low, but does not obtain a  commitment for additional purchases. The arrangement of merchandise on  the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is  incidental to and in conjunction with the employee's own outside sales.  Because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor  direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not exempt  outside sales work.</p>
