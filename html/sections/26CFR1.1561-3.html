Such form shall contain the information required for each such member.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No apportionment plan in effect. If the component members of a controlled group of corporations do not have an apportionment plan in effect, the amounts of the section 1561(a) items must be divided equally among all such members.
