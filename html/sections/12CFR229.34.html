                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Warranties. Each paying bank or returning bank that transfers a  returned check and receives a settlement or other consideration for it  warrants to the transferee returning bank, to any subsequent returning  bank, to the depositary bank, and to the owner of the check, that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The paying bank, or in the case of a check payable by a bank and  payable through another bank, the bank by which the check is payable,  returned the check within its deadline under the U.C.C., Regulation J  (12 CFR part 210), or Sec. 229.30(c) of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is authorized to return the check;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The check has not been materially altered; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of a notice in lieu of return, the original check  has not and will not be returned.  These warranties are not made with respect to checks drawn on the  Treasury of the United States, U.S. Postal Service money orders, or  checks drawn on a state or a unit of general local government that are  not payable through or at a bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Warranty of notice of nonpayment. Each paying bank that gives a  notice of nonpayment warrants to the transferee bank, to any subsequent  transferee bank, to the depositary bank, and to the owner of the check  that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The paying bank, or in the case of a check payable by a bank and  payable through another bank, the bank by which the check is payable,  returned or will return the check within its deadline under the U.C.C.,  Regulation J (12 CFR part 210), or Sec. 229.30(c) of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is authorized to send the notice; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The check has not been materially altered.  These warranties are not made with respect to checks drawn on a state or  a unit of general local government that are not payable through or at a  bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Warranty of settlement amount, encoding, and offset. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each  bank that presents one or more checks to a paying bank and in return  receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the paying bank  that the total amount of the checks presented is equal to the total  amount of the settlement demanded by the presenting bank from the paying  bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each bank that transfers one or more checks or returned checks  to a collecting, returning, or depositary bank and in return receives a  settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee bank that  the accompanying information, if any, accurately indicates the total  amount of the checks or returned checks transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each bank that presents or transfers a check or returned check  warrants to any bank that subsequently handles it that, at the time of  presentment or transfer, the information encoded after issue in magnetic  ink on the check or returned check is correct. For purposes of this  paragraph, the information encoded after issue on the check or returned  check includes any information placed in the MICR line of a substitute  check that represents that check or returned check.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a bank settles with another bank for checks presented, or for  returned checks for which it is the depositary bank, in amount exceeding  the total amount of the checks, the settling bank may set off the excess  settlement amount against subsequent settlements for checks presented,  or for returned checks for which it is the depositary bank, that it  receives from the other bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, ``account'' includes an account as defined in Sec. 229.2(a) as  well as   a credit or other arrangement that allows a person to draw checks that  are payable by, through, or at a bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a paying bank asserts a claim for breach of warranty under  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the warranting bank may defend by  proving that the customer of the paying bank is precluded under U.C.C.  4-406, as applicable, from asserting against the paying bank the  unauthorized issuance of the check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Damages. Damages for breach of these warranties shall not exceed  the consideration received by the bank that presents or transfers a  check or returned check, plus interest compensation and expenses related  to the check or returned check, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tender of defense. If a bank is sued for breach of a warranty  under this section, it may give a prior bank in the collection or return  chain written notice of the litigation, and the bank notified may then  give similar notice to any other prior bank. If the notice states that  the bank notified may come in and defend and that failure to do so will  bind the bank notified in an action later brought by the bank giving the  notice as to any determination of fact common to the two litigations,  the bank notified is so bound unless after seasonable receipt of the  notice the bank notified does come in and defend.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of claim. Unless a claimant gives notice of a claim for  breach of warranty under this section to the bank that made the warranty  within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and  the identity of the warranting bank, the warranting bank is discharged  to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the  claim.
