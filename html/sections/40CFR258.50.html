This demonstration must be certified by a qualified ground-water scientist and approved by the Director of an approved State, and must be based upon:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Site-specific field collected measurements, sampling, and analysis of physical, chemical, and biological processes affecting contaminant fate and transport, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contaminant fate and transport predictions that maximize contaminant migration and consider impacts on human health and environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Owners and operators of MSWLF units, except those meeting the conditions of Sec. 258.1(f), must comply with the ground-water monitoring requirements of this part according to the following schedule unless an alternative schedule is specified under paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing MSWLF units and lateral expansions less than one mile from a drinking water intake (surface or subsurface) must be in compliance with the ground-water monitoring requirements specified in Sec.
