The conditions to be imposed in any instrument of authorization will be recommended by the district engineer when forwarding the report to the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), through the Chief of Engineers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> District engineers are authorized to decide whether DA authorization for a dam or dike in an intrastate navigable water of the United States will be issued (see 33 CFR 325.8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Processing a DA application under section 9 will not be completed until the approval of the United States Congress has been obtained if the navigable water of the United States is an interstate waterbody, or until the approval of the appropriate state legislature has been obtained if the navigable water of the United States is an intrastate waterbody (i.e., the navigable portion of the navigable water of the United States is solely within the boundaries of one state). The district engineer, upon receipt of such an application, will notify the applicant that the consent of Congress or the state legislature must be obtained before a permit can be issued.</p>
