All conditions of Federal, state,  and/or KSC regulations and permits for manatee protection shall be  binding to the contract. Notification and coordination of all water  related activities at KSC will be done through the Environmental  Management Branch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall incorporate the provisions of this clause  in applicable subcontracts.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [80 FR 36723, June 26, 2015]</p>
