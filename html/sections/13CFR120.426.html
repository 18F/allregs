                                Sec. 120.426  What action will SBA take if a securitizer transfers  period?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If a securitizer transfers the subordinated tranche prior to the  termination of the holding period, SBA will suspend   immediately the securitizer's ability to make new 7(a) loans. The  securitizer will have 30 calendar days to submit an explanation to  Lender Oversight Committee (``Committee''). The Committee will have 30  calendar days to review the explanation and determine whether to lift  the suspension. If an explanation is not received within 30 calendar  days or the explanation is not satisfactory to the Committee, SBA may  transfer the servicing of the applicable securitized loans, including  the securitizers' servicing fee on the guaranteed and unguaranteed  portions and the premium protection fee on the guaranteed portion, to  another SBA participating Lender.
