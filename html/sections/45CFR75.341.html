This information must be  collected with the frequency required by the terms and conditions of the  Federal award, but no less frequently than annually nor more frequently  than quarterly except in unusual circumstances, for example where more  frequent reporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the  Federal award or could significantly affect program outcomes, and  preferably in coordination with performance reporting.</p>
