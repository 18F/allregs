                            <p class="depth0">If a State wishes to apply for a waiver of a requirement of this part, the Director may waive such requirement with respect to such State, unless required by statute, if the Director determines that such waiver will advance the purposes of this part and is appropriate and consistent with Federal refugee policy objectives. To the fullest extent practicable, the Director will approve or disapprove an application for a waiver within 130 days of receipt of such application. The Director shall provide timely written notice of the reasons for denial to States whose applications are disapproved.
