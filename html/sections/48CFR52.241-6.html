                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 41.501(c)(5), insert a clause substantially the  same as the following:</p><p class="depth0">Service Provisions (FEB 1995)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Measurement of service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All service furnished by the  Contractor shall be measured by suitable metering equipment of standard  manufacture, to be furnished, installed, maintained, repaired,  calibrated, and read by the Contractor at its expense. When more than a  single meter is installed at a service location, the readings thereof  may be billed conjunctively, if appropriate. In the event any meter  fails to register (or registers incorrectly) the service furnished, the  parties shall agree upon the length of time of meter malfunction and the  quantity of service delivered during such period of time. An appropriate  adjustment shall be made to the next invoice for the purpose of  correcting such errors. However, any meter which registers not more than  ---- percent slow or fast shall be deemed correct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor shall read all meters at periodic intervals of  approximately 30 days or in accordance with the policy of the cognizant  regulatory body or applicable bylaws. All billings based on meter  readings of less than ---- days shall be prorated accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Meter test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor, at its expense, shall  periodically inspect and test Contractor-installed meters at intervals  not exceeding ---- year(s). The Government has the right to have  representation during the inspection and test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the written request of the Contracting Officer, the  Contractor shall make additional tests of any or all such meters in the  presence of Government representatives. The cost of such additional  tests shall be borne by the Government if the percentage of errors is  found to be not more than ---- percent slow or fast.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No meter shall be placed in service or allowed to remain in  service which has an error in registration in excess of ---- percent  under normal operating conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Change in volume or character. Reasonable notice shall be given  by the Contracting Officer to the Contractor regarding any material  changes anticipated in the volume or characteristics of the utility  service required at each location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continuity of service and consumption. The Contractor shall use  reasonable diligence to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of  service at each service location, but shall not be liable for damages,  breach of contract or otherwise, to the Government for failure,  suspension, diminution, or other variations of service occasioned by or  in consequence of any cause beyond the control of the Contractor,  including but not limited to acts of God or of the public enemy, fires,  floods, earthquakes, or other catastrophe, strikes, or failure or  breakdown of transmission or other facilities. If any such failure,  suspension, diminution, or other variation of service shall aggregate  more than ---- hour(s) during any billing period hereunder, an equitable  adjustment shall be made in the monthly billing specified in this  contract (including the minimum monthly charge).</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [59 FR 67024, Dec. 28, 1994; 60 FR 5870, Jan. 31, 1995]</p>
