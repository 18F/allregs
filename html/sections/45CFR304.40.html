                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic conditions. When a State has been reimbursed Federal funds  for expenditures claimed under title IV-D, which is later determined to  be unallowable for Federal financial participation, the State may make  repayment of such Federal funds in installments provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the repayment exceeds 2\1/2\ percent of the  estimated annual State share of expenditures for the IV-D program as set  forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State has notified the OCSE Regional Office in writing of  its intent to make installment repayments. Such notice must be given  prior to the time repayment of the total was otherwise due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Criteria governing installment repayments. (1) The number of  quarters over which the repayment of the total unallowable expenditures  will be made will be determined by the percentage the total of such  repayment is of the estimated State share of the annual expenditures for  the IV-D program as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Number of</p><p class="depth0">Total repayment amount as percentage of State share of      quarters</p><p class="depth0">annual expenditures for the IV-D program              to make</p><p class="depth0">repayment ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2.5 percent or less.........................................           1 Greater than 2.5, but not greater than 5....................           2 Greater than 5, but not greater than 7.5....................           3 Greater than 7.5, but not greater than 10...................           4 Greater than 10, but not greater than 15....................           5 Greater than 15, but not greater than 20....................           6 Greater than 20, but not greater than 25....................           7 Greater than 25, but not greater than 30....................           8 Greater than 30, but not greater than 47.5..................           9 Greater than 47.5, but not greater than 65..................          10 Greater than 65, but not greater than 82.5..................          11 Greater than 82.5, but not greater than 100.................          12 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   The quarterly repayment amounts for each of the quarters in the  repayment schedule shall not be less than the following percentages of  estimated State share of the annual expenditures for the program against  which the recovery is made.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Repayment</p><p class="depth0">installment</p><p class="depth0">may not be</p><p class="depth0">For each of the following quarters               less than</p><p class="depth0">these</p><p class="depth0">percentages ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1 to 4.....................................................          2.5</p><p class="depth0">5 to 8.....................................................          5.0 9 to 12....................................................         17.5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages  during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required  minimum percentages would be applied first to the last scheduled  payment, then to the next to the last payment, and so forth as  necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The latest required financial reports submitted by the State  shall be used to estimatethe State's share of annual expenditures for  the IV-D program. That estimated share shall be the sum of the State's  share of the estimates for four quarters, beginning with the quarter in  which the first installment is to be paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In case of termination of the program, the actual State share-- rather than the estimate--shall be used for determining whether the  amount of the repayment exceeds 2\1/2\ percent of the annual State share  for the IV-D program. The annual State share in these cases will be  determined using payments computable for Federal funding as reported for  the program by the State on its Quarterly Report of Expenditures and  Estimates submitted for the last four quarters preceding the date on  which the program was terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Repayment shall be accomplished through adjustment in the  quarterly grants over the period covered by the repayment schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The amount of the repayment for purpose of paragraphs (a) and  (b) of this section may not include any amount previously approved for  installment repayment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly  installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100% of the estimated  State share of annual expenditures.  In these circumstances, the criteria in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) or  (3) of this section, as appropriate, shall be followed for repayment of  the amount equal to 100% of the annual State share. The remaining amount  of the repayment shall be in quarterly amounts not less than those for  the 9th through 12th quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The amount of a retroactive claim to be paid a State will be  offset against any amounts to be, or already being, repaid by the State  in installments, under the same title of the Social Security Act. Under  this provision the State may choose to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Suspend payments until the retroactive claim due the State has,  in fact, been offset; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Continue payments until the reduced amount of its debt  (remaining after the offset), has been paid in full. This second option  would result in a shorter payment period.  A retroactive claim for the purpose of this regulation is a claim  applicable to any period ending 12 months or more prior to the beginning  of the quarter in which the payment is to be made by the Service.
