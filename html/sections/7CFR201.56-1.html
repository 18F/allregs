Any cluster  which produces at least one normal seedling is classified as normal;  only one normal seedling per cluster is to be counted (see  Sec. 201.56(d)). Toxic substances from the clusters of beet and Swiss  chard may cause discoloring of the hypocotyl and/or root. Seedlings  which are slightly discolored are to be classified as normal; however,  if there is excessive discoloration, retest by the method in  Sec. 201.58(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Abnormal seedling description.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cotyledons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Less than half of the original cotyledon tissue remaining  attached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Less than half of the original cotyledon tissue free of  necrosis or decay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Epicotyl:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Missing.
