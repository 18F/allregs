                            <p class="depth0">Section 6 of the Act states:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever radiotelephone capability is required by this Act, a  vessel's radiotelephone equipment shall be maintained in effective  operating condition. If the radiotelephone equipment carried aboard a  vessel ceases to operate, the master shall exercise due diligence to  restore it or cause it to be restored to effective operating condition  at the earliest practicable time. The failure of a vessel's  radiotelephone equipment shall not, in itself, constitute a violation of  this   Act, nor shall it obligate the master of any vessel to moor or anchor  his vessel; however, the loss of radiotelephone capability shall be  given consideration in the navigation of the vessel.</p>
