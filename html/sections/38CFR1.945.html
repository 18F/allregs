The member of the Armed  Services must have been serving on active duty on or after September 11,  2001. In any case where all or any part of a debt of a covered member of  the Armed Forces was collected, the Secretary may refund the amount  collected, but only if the Secretary determines that, under the  circumstances applicable with respect to the deceased member of the  Armed Forces, it is appropriate to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any case where all or any part of a debt of a covered member  of the Armed Forces or veteran, as described under paragraph (b) of this  section, was   collected on or after September 11, 2001, the Secretary may refund the  amount collected if, in the Secretary's determination, the indebtedness  would have been terminated under authority of 38 U.S.C. 5302A.

Such requests for suspension or  termination and/or refund may be initiated by the head of the VA  administration having responsibility for the program that gave rise to  the indebtedness, or any concerned staff office, or by the Chairman of  the Board of Veterans' Appeals. When a recommendation for refund under  this section is initiated by the head of a staff office, or by the  Chairman, Board of Veterans' Appeals, the views of the head of the  administration that administers the program that gave rise to the  indebtedness will be obtained and transmitted with the recommendation of  the initiating office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The provisions of this section concerning suspension or  termination of collection actions and the refunding of moneys previously  collected do not apply to any amounts owed the United States under any  program carried out under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37.
