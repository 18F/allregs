                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1846.370(a), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Mission Critical Space System Personnel Reliability Program (MAR 1997)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In implementation of the Mission Critical Space System Personnel Reliability Program, described in 14 CFR 1214.5, the Government shall identify personnel positions that are mission critical. Some of the positions as identified may now or in the future be held by employees of the Contractor. Upon notification by the Contracting Officer that a mission-critical position is being or will be filled by one or more of the Contractor's employees, the Contractor shall (1) provide the affected employees with a clear understanding

of the investigative and medical requirements and, (2) to the extent permitted by applicable law, assist the Government by furnishing personal data and medical records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The standard that will be used in certifying individuals for a mission-critical position is that they must be determined to be suitable, competent, and reliable in the performance of their assigned duties in accordance with the screening requirements 14 CFR 1214.5. If the Government determines that a Contractor employee occupying or nominated to occupy a mission-critical position will not be certified for such duty, the Contracting Officer shall (1) furnish to the employee the specific reasons for its action; (2) advise the employee that he/she may avail himself/herself of the review procedures that are a part of the certification system; and (3) furnish him/her a copy of those procedures upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a Contractor employee who has been nominated for (but has not yet filled) a mission-critical position is not certified, the Contractor agrees to defer the appointment to the position until the employee has had an opportunity to pursue the referenced procedures. If the employee is an incumbent to the position, the Contractor agrees, upon the request of the Government, to remove him/her from the position temporarily pending an appeal of the action under the review procedures. If any employee not certified elects not to take action under the procedures, or, if having taken action, is not successful in obtaining a reversal of the determination, the Contractor agrees not to appoint the employee to the position, or if already appointed, to promptly remove the employee.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)
