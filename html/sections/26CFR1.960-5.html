No deduction shall be allowed under section 164 for the taxable year of such exclusion for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued on or with respect to such excluded amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Illustration. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. Domestic Corporation N owns all the one class of stock of controlled foreign corporation A. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. All of A Corporation's earnings and profits of $80 for 1978 (after payment of foreign income taxes of $20 on its total income of $100 for such year) are attributable to amount required under section 951(a) to be included in N Corporation's gross income for 1978. For 1978, N Corporation chooses to claim a foreign tax credit for the $20 of foreign income taxes which for such year are paid by A Corporation and deemed paid by N Corporation under section 960(a)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 1.960-1. For 1979, A Corporation distributes the entire $80 of 1978 earnings and profits, a foreign income tax of $8 being withheld therefrom. Although N Corporation does not choose to claim a foreign tax credit for 1979, it may not deduct such $8 of foreign income taxes under section 164. Corporation N may, however, deduct under such section a foreign income tax of $4 which is withheld from a distribution of $40 by A Corporation during 1979 from its 1979 earnings and profits.
