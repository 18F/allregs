(Such boxes may have a joint common with an explosion-proof enclosure provided the adjoining surfaces conform to the requirements of subpart B of this part.)</p><p class="depth0">Cylindrical joint means a joint comprised of two contiguous, concentric, cylindrical surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">Distribution box means an enclosure through which one or more portable cables may be connected to a source of electrical energy, and which contains a short-circuit protective device for each outgoing cable.</p><p class="depth0">Experimental equipment means any electrical machine or accessory that an applicant or MSHA may desire to operate experimentally for a limited time in a gassy mine or tunnel. (For example, this might include a machine constructed at a mine, an imported machine, or a machine or device designed and developed by MSHA.)</p><p class="depth0">Explosion-proof enclosure means an enclosure that complies with the applicable design requirements in subpart B of this part and is so constructed that it will withstand internal explosions of methane-air mixtures: (1) Without damage to or excessive distortion of its walls or cover(s), and (2) without ignition of surrounding methane-air mixtures or discharge of flame from inside to outside the enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Flame-arresting path means two or more adjoining or adjacent surfaces between which the escape of flame is prevented.</p><p class="depth0">Flame resistant as applied to cable, hose, and insultating materials means material that will burn when held in a flame but will cease burning when the flame is removed.</p><p class="depth0">Flammable mixture means a mixture of methane or natural gas and air that when ignited will propagate flame. Natural gas containing a high percentage of methane is a satisfactory substitute for pure methane in most tests.</p><p class="depth0">Gassy mine means a coal mine classed as ``gassy'' by MESA or by the State in which the mine is situated.</p><p class="depth0">Incendive arc or spark means an arc or spark releasing enough electrical or thermal energy to ignite a flammable mixture of the most easily ignitable composition.</p><p class="depth0">Intrinsically safe means incapable of releasing enough electrical or thermal energy under normal or abnormal conditions to cause ignition of a flammable mixture of methane or natural gas and air of the most easily ignitable composition.</p><p class="depth0">MESA means the United States Department of the Interior, Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration. Predecessor organization to MSHA, prior to March 9, 1978.</p><p class="depth0">Mobile equipment means equipment that is self-propelled.</p><p class="depth0">MSHA means the United States Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration.</p><p class="depth0">Normal operation means the regular performance of those functions for which a machine or accessory was designed.</p><p class="depth0">Permissible equipment means a completely assembled electrical machine or accessory for which a formal approval has been issued, as authorized by the Administrator, Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-173, 30 U.S.C. 801 or, after March 9, 1978, by the Assistant Secretary under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 91-173, as amended by Pub. L. 95-164, 30 U.S.C. 801).</p><p class="depth0">Permit means a formal document, signed by the Assistant Secretary, authorizing the operation of specific experimental equipment in a gassy mine or tunnel under prescribed conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Plane joint means two adjoining surfaces in parallel planes.</p><p class="depth0">Portable cable, or trailing cable means a flame-resistant, flexible cable or cord through which electrical energy is transmitted to a permissible machine or accessory. (A portable cable is that portion of the power-supply system between the last short-circuit protective device, acceptable to MSHA, in the system and the machine or accessory to which it transmits electrical energy.)</p><p class="depth0">Portable equipment means equipment that may be moved frequently and is constructed or mounted to facilitate such movement.</p><p class="depth0">Potted component means a component that is entirely embedded in a solidified insulating material within an enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Pressure piling means the development of abnormal pressure as a result of accelerated rate of burning of a gas-air mixture.
