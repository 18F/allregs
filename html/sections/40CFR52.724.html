The State must complete the reanalysis, submit the results to USEPA and submit any necessary, additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board by September 30, 1980. Any necessary regulation must be finally promulgated by the State and submitted to USEPA by September 30, 1981.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extension of Condition--USEPA approves the date of July 1, 1984 for submitting the draft sulfur dioxide rule revisions and supporting documentation as required in (a)(1) for Peoria, Hollis and Groveland Townships in Illinois.
