Argument will  not be received in evidence; rather it should be presented in  statements, memoranda, or briefs, as determined by the presiding  officer. Brief opening statements, which shall be limited to statement  of the party's position and what he intends to prove, may be made at  hearings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearings for the reception of evidence will be held only in  cases where issues of fact must be resolved in order to determine  whether the respondent has failed to comply with one or more applicable  requirements of part 100 of this title. In any case where it appears  from the respondent's answer to the notice of hearing or opportunity for  hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his admissions or  stipulations in the record, that there are no matters of material fact  in dispute, the reviewing authority or presiding officer may enter an  order so finding, vacating the hearing date if one has been set, and  fixing the time for filing briefs under Sec. 101.101. Thereafter the  proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with subpart J of this  part. The presiding officer may allow an appeal from such order in  accordance with Sec. 101.86.</p>
