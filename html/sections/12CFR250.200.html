                                Sec. 250.200  Investment in bank premises by holding company banks.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board of Governors has been asked whether, in determining  under section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371d) how much  may be invested in bank premises without prior Board approval, a State  member bank, which is owned by a registered bank holding company, is  required to include indebtedness of a corporation, wholly owned by the  holding company, that is engaged in holding premises of banks in the  holding company system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 24A provides, in part, as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Hereafter * * * no State member bank, without the approval of the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall (1) invest in  bank premises, or in the stock, bonds, debentures, or other such  obligations of any corporation holding the premises of such bank or (2)  make loans to or upon the security of the stock of any such corporation,  if the aggregate of all such investments and loans, together with the  amount of any indebtedness incurred by any such corporation which is an  affiliate of the bank, as defined in section 2 of the Banking Act of  1933, as amended [12 U.S.C. 221a], will exceed the amount of the capital  stock of such banks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A corporation that is owned by a holding company is an  ``affiliate of each of the holding company's majority-owned banks as  that term is defined in said section 2. Therefore, under the explicit  provisions of section 24A, each State member bank, any part of whose  premises is owned by such an affiliate, must include the affiliate's  total indebtedness in determining whether a proposed premises investment  by the bank would cause the aggregate figure to exceed the amount of the  bank's capital stock, so that the Board's prior approval would be  required. Where the affiliate holds the premises of a number of the  holding company's banks, the amount of the affiliate's indebtedness may  be so large that Board approval is required for every proposed  investment in bank premises by each majority-owned State member bank, to  which the entire indebtedness of the affiliate is required to be  attributed. The Board believes that, in these circumstances, individual  approvals are not essential to effectuate the purpose of section 24A,  which is to safeguard the soundness and liquidity of member banks, and  that the protection sought by Congress can be achieved by a suitably  circumscribed general approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accordingly the Board hereby grants general approval for any  investment or loan (as described in section 24A) by any State member  bank, the majority of the stock of which is owned by a registered bank  holding company, if the proposed investment or loan will   not cause either (1) all such investments and loans by the member bank  (together with the indebtedness of any bank premises subsidiary thereof)  to exceed 100 percent of the bank's capital stock, or (2) the aggregate  of such investments and loans by all of the holding company's subsidiary  banks (together with the indebtedness of any bank premises affiliates  thereof) to exceed 100 percent of the aggregate capital stock of said  banks.  (12 U.S.C. 221a, 371d)</p>
