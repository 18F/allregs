                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FM broadcast stations employing transmitters authorized after  January 1, 1960, must maintain the bandwidth occupied by their emissions  in accordance with the specification detailed below. FM broadcast  stations employing transmitters installed or type accepted before  January 1, 1960, must achieve the highest degree of compliance with  these specifications practicable with their existing equipment.   In either case, should harmful interference to other authorized stations  occur, the licensee shall correct the problem promptly or cease  operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any emission appearing on a frequency removed from the carrier  by between 120 kHz and 240 kHz inclusive must be attenuated at least 25  dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier. Compliance with this  requirement will be deemed to show the occupied bandwidth to be 240 kHz  or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any emission appearing on a frequency removed from the carrier  by more than 240 kHz and up to and including 600 kHz must be attenuated  at least 35 dB below the level of the unmodulated carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any emission appearing on a frequency removed from the carrier  by more than 600 kHz must be attenuated at least 43 + 10  Log10 (Power, in watts) dB below the level of the unmodulated  carrier, or 80 dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Preemphasis shall not be greater than the impedance-frequency  characteristics of a series inductance resistance network having a time  constant of 75 microseconds. (See upper curve of Figure 2 of Sec.   73.333.)  [51 FR 17028, May 8, 1986]</p>
