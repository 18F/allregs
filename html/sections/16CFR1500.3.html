The following items interpret, supplement,  or provide alternatives to definitions set forth in section 2 of the act  (and restated in paragraph (b) of this section):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> To provide flexibility as to the number of animals tested, and  to emphasize in vitro testing methods, the following is an alternative  to the definition of ``highly toxic'' in section 2(h) of the act (and  paragraph (b)(6) of this section); Highly toxic means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A substance determined by the Commission to be highly toxic on  the basis of human experience; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A substance that produces death within 14 days in half or more  than half of a group of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> White rats (each weighing between 200 and 300 grams) when a  single dose of 50 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight is  administered orally;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> White rats (each weighing between 200 and 300 grams) when a  concentration of 200 parts per million by volume or less of gas or  vapor, or 2 milligrams per liter by volume or less of mist or dust, is  inhaled continuously for 1 hour or less, if such concentration is likely  to be encountered by man when the substance is used in any reasonably  foreseeable manner; and/or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Rabbits (each weighing between 2.3 and 3.0 kilograms) when a  dosage of 200 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight is  administered by continuous contact with the bare skin for 24 hours or  less by the method described in Sec. 1500.40.  The number of animals tested shall be sufficient to give a statistically  significant result and shall be in conformity with good pharmacological  practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A substance that produces a result of `highly toxic' in any of  the approved test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy  set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico  test methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of- evidence analysis comprising all of the following that are available:  existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships,  physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To give specificity to the definition of ``toxic'' in section  2(g) of the act (and restated in paragraph (b)(5) of this section), the  following supplements that definition. ``Toxic'' applies to any  substance that is ``toxic'' (but not ``highly toxic'') on the basis of  human experience. The following categories are not intended to be  inclusive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The number of animals tested shall be sufficient to give a  statistically significant result and shall be in conformity with good  pharmacological practices. Toxic also applies to any substance that can  be labeled as such, based on the outcome of any of the approved test  methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16  CFR 1500.232, including data from, including data from in vitro or in  silico test methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated  weight-of-evidence analysis comprising all of the following that are  available: existing human and animal data, structure activity  relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Chronic toxicity. A substance is toxic because it presents a  chronic hazard if it falls into one of the following categories. (For  additional information see the chronic toxicity guidelines at 16 CFR  1500.135.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For Carcinogens. A substance is toxic if it is or contains a  known or probable human carcinogen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For Neurotoxicological Toxicants. A substance is toxic if it is  or contains a known or probable human neurotoxin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For Developmental or Reproductive Toxicants. A substance is  toxic if it is or contains a known or probable human developmental or  reproductive toxicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corrosive means a substance that causes visible destruction or  irreversible alterations in the tissue at the site of contact. A test  for a corrosive substance is whether, by human experience, such tissue  destruction occurs at the site of application. A substance would be  considered corrosive to the skin if a weight-of-evidence analysis  suggests that it is corrosive, or validated in vitro test method  suggests that it is corrosive, or if, when tested by the in vivo  technique described in Sec. 1500.41, the structure of the tissue at the  site of contact is destroyed or changed irreversibly in 24 hours or  less. Other appropriate tests should be applied when contact of the  substance with other than skin tissue is being considered. A substance  could also be labeled corrosive based on the outcome of any of the  approved test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set  forth in 16 CFR 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico test  methods that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of- evidence analysis   comprising all of the following that are available: Existing human and  animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical  properties, and chemical reactivity data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The definition of irritant in section 2(j) of the act (restated  in paragraph (b)(8) of this section) is supplemented by the following:  Irritant includes primary irritant to the skin, as well as substances  irritant to the eye or to mucous membranes. Primary irritant means a  substance that is not corrosive and that human experience data indicate  is a primary irritant; and/or means a substance that results in an  empirical score of five or more when tested by the method described in  1500.41; and/or a substance that can be considered a primary irritant  based on the outcome of any of the approved test methods described in  the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232, including  data from in vitro or in silico test methods that the Commission has  approved; or a validated weight-of-evidence analysis comprising all of  the following that are available: existing human and animal data,  structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and  chemical reactivity data. Eye irritant means a substance that human  experience data indicate is an irritant to the eye; and/or means a  substance for which a positive test is obtained when tested by the  method described in 1500.42; and/or means a substance that can be  considered an eye irritant based on the outcome of any of the approved  test methods described in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in  16 CFR 1500.232, including data from in vitro or in silico test methods  that the Commission has approved; or a validated weight-of-evidence  analysis comprising all of the following that are available: existing  human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical  properties, and chemical reactivity data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The definition of strong sensitizer in section 2(k) of the  Federal Hazardous Substances Act (restated in paragraph (b)(9) of this  section) is supplemented by the following definitions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sensitizer. A sensitizer is a substance that is capable of  inducing a state of immunologically mediated hypersensitivity (including  allergic photosensitivity) following a variable period of exposure to  that substance. Hypersensitivity to a substance will become evident by  an allergic reaction elicited upon reexposure to the same substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Significant potential for causing hypersensitivity. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Before  designating any substance a ``strong sensitizer,'' the Commission shall  find that the substance has significant potential for causing  hypersensitivity. Significant potential for causing hypersensitivity is  a relative determination that must be made separately for each  substance. The determination may be based on documented medical evidence  of hypersensitivity reactions upon subsequent exposure to the same  substance obtained from epidemiological surveys or case histories;  controlled in vivo or in vitro experimental studies; susceptibility  profiles (e.g., genetics, age, gender, atopic status) in non-sensitized  or allergic subjects; and chemical or functional properties of the  substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In determining whether a substance is a ``strong'' sensitizer,  the Commission shall consider the available data for a number of  factors, following a weight-of-evidence approach. The following factors  (if available), ranked in descending order of importance, should be  considered: well-conducted clinical and diagnostic studies,  epidemiological studies, with a preference for general population  studies over occupational studies, well-conducted animal studies, well- conducted in vitro test studies, cross-reactivity data, and case  histories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Additional consideration may be given to Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationships (QSARs), in silico data, specific human  sensitization threshold values, other data on potency and sensitizer  bioavailability, if data are available and the methods validated.  Bioavailability is the dose of the allergen available to interact with a  tissue. Bioavailability is a reflection of how well the skin or another  organ can absorb the allergen and the actual penetrating ability of the  allergen, including factors such as size and composition of the  chemical.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Criteria for a ``well-conducted'' study would include: validated  outcomes, relevant dosing, route of administration, and use of  appropriate controls. Studies should be carried out according to  national and/or international test guidelines and according to good  laboratory practice (GLP), compliance with good clinical practice (GCP),  and good epidemiological practice (GEP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Before the Commission designates any substance as a ``strong''  sensitizer, frequency of occurrence and range of severity of reactions  in exposed subpopulations having average or high susceptibility will be  considered. The minimal severity of a reaction for the purpose of  designating a material as a ``strong sensitizer'' is a clinically  important reaction. A clinically important reaction would be considered  one with a significant impact on quality of life. Consideration should  be given to the location of the hypersensitivity response, such as the  face, hands, and feet as well as persistence of clinical manifestations.  For example, strong sensitizers may produce substantial illness,  including any or all of the following: substantial physiological  effects, such as discomfort and distress, substantial hardship,  functional or structural impairment, persistent morbidity, or in rare  cases, mortality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Normal living tissue. The allergic hypersensitivity reaction  occurs in normal living tissues, including the skin, mucous membranes  (e.g., ocular, oral), and other organ systems, such as the respiratory  tract and gastrointestinal tract, either singularly or in combination,  following sensitization by contact, ingestion, or inhalation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The Consumer Product Safety Commission, by the regulations  published in this section, defines the terms extremely flammable,  flammable, and combustible, appearing in section 2(1) of the Federal  Hazardous Substances Act, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The term extremely flammable shall apply to any substance which  has a flashpoint at or below 20 [deg]F (-6.7 [deg]C) as determined by  the test method described at Sec. 1500.43a, except that, any mixture  having one component or more with a flashpoint higher than 20 [deg]F (- 6.7 [deg]C) which comprises at least 99 percent of the total volume of  the mixture is not considered to be an extremely flammable substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term flammable shall apply to any substance having a  flashpoint above 20 [deg]F (-6.7 [deg]C) and below 100 [deg]F (37.8  [deg]C), as determined by the method described at Sec. 1500.43a, except  that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any mixture having one component or more with a flashpoint at or  above 100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C) which comprises at least 99 percent of  the total volume of the mixture is not considered to be a flammable  substance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any mixture containing 24 percent or less of water miscible  alcohols, by volume, in aqueous solution is not considered to be  flammable if the mixture does not present a significant flammability  hazard when used by consumers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term combustible shall apply to any substance having a  flashpoint at or above 100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C) to and including 150  [deg]F (65.6 [deg]C) as determined by the test method described at Sec.  1500.43a, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any mixture having one component or more with a flashpoint  higher than 150 [deg]F (65.6 [deg]C) which comprises at least 99 percent  of the total volume of the mixture is not considered to be a combustible  hazardous substance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any mixture containing 24 percent or less of water miscible  alcohols, by volume, in aqueous solution is not considered to be  combustible if the mixture does not present a significant flammability  hazard when used by consumers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To determine flashpoint temperatures for purposes of enforcing  and administering requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act  applicable to ``extremely flammable,'' ``flammable,'' and  ``combustible'' hazardous substances, the Commission will follow the  procedures set forth in Sec. 1500.43a. However, the Commission will  allow manufacturers and labelers of substances and products subject to  those requirements to rely on properly conducted tests using the  Tagliabue open-cup method which was in effect prior to the issuance of  Sec. 1500.43a (as published at 38 FR 27012, September 27, 1973, and set  forth below), and the defintions of the terms ``extremely flammable,''  ``flammable,'' and ``combustible'' in   this section before its amendment (as published at 38 FR 27012,  September 27, 1983, and amended 38 FR 30105, November 1, 1973, set forth  in the note following this section) if all of the following conditions  are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The substance or product was subject to and complied with the  requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act for ``extremely  flammable,'' ``flammable,'' or ``combustible'' hazardous substances  before the effective date of Sec. 1500.43a; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No change has been made to the formulation or labeling of such  substance or product after the effective date of Sec. 1500.43a,  prescribing a closed-cup test apparatus and procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Extremely flammable solid means a solid substance that ignites  and burns at an ambient temperature of 80 [deg]F or less when subjected  to friction, percussion, or electrical spark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Flammable solid means a solid substance that, when tested by  the method described in Sec. 1500.44, ignites and burns with a self- sustained flame at a rate greater than one-tenth of an inch per second  along its major axis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Extremely flammable contents of self-pressurized container  means contents of a self-pressurized container that, when tested by the  method described in Sec. 1500.45, a flashback (a flame extending back  to the dispenser) is obtained at any degree of valve opening and the  flashpoint, when tested by the method described in Sec. 1500.43a is  less than 20 [deg]F (-6.7 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Flammable contents of self-pressurized container means  contents of a self-pressurized container that, when tested by the method  described in Sec. 1500.45, a flame projection exceeding 18 inches is  obtained at full valve opening, or flashback (a flame extending back to  the dispenser) is obtained at any degree of valve opening.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The definition of hazardous substance in section 2(f)(1)(A) of  the act (restated in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section) is  supplemented by the following definitions or interpretations or terms  used therein:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A substance or mixture of substances that ``generates pressure  through decomposition, heat, or other means'' is a hazardous substance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If it explodes when subjected to an electrical spark,  percussion, or the flame of a burning paraffin candle for 5 seconds or  less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If it expels the closure of its container, or bursts its  container, when held at or below 130 [deg]F. for 2 days or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If it erupts from its opened container at a temperature of 130  [deg]F. or less after having been held in the closed container at 130  [deg]F. for 2 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If it comprises the contents of a self-pressurized container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial personal injury or illness means any injury or  illness of a significant nature. It need not be severe or serious. What  is excluded by the word ``substantial'' is a wholly insignificant or  negligible injury or illness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Proximate result means a result that follows in the course of  events without an unforeseeable, intervening, independent cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonably foreseeable handling or use includes the reasonably  foreseeable accidental handling or use, not only by the purchaser or  intended user of the product, but by all others in a household,  especially children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The definition of ``radioactive substance'' in section 2(m) of  the act (restated in paragraph (b)(11) of this section) is supplemented  by the following: Radioactive substance means a substance which, because  of nuclear instability, emits electromagnetic and/or particulate  radiation capable of producing ions in its passage through matter.  Source materials, special nuclear material, and byproduct materials  described in section 2(f)(3) of the act are exempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> In the definition of ``label'' in section 2(n) of the act  (restated in paragraph (b)(12) of this section), a provision stipulates  that words, statements, or other information required to be on the label  must also appear on all accompanying literature where there are  directions for use, written or otherwise. To make this provision more  specific, ``accompanying literature'' is interpreted to mean any  placard, pamphlet, booklet, book, sign, or other written, printed, or  graphic matter or visual device that provides directions for use,  written or otherwise, and that   is used in connection with the display, sale, demonstration, or  merchandising of a hazardous substance intended for or packaged in a  form suitable for use in the household or by children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The definition of ``misbranded hazardous substance'' in section  2(p) of this act (restated in paragraph (b)(14) of this section) is  supplemented by the following definitions or interpretations of terms  used therein:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Hazardous substances intended, or packaged in a form suitable,  for use in the household means any hazardous substance, whether or not  packaged, that under any customary or reasonably foreseeable condition  of purchase, storage, or use may be brought into or around a house,  apartment, or other place where people dwell, or in or around any  related building or shed including, but not limited to, a garage,  carport, barn, or storage shed. The term includes articles, such as  polishes or cleaners, designed primarily for professional use but which  are available in retail stores, such as hobby shops, for nonprofessional  use. Also included are items, such as antifreeze and radiator cleaners,  that although principally for car use may be stored in or around  dwelling places. The term does not include industrial supplies that  might be taken into a home by a serviceman. An article labeled as, and  marketed solely for, industrial use does not become subject to this act  because of the possibility that an industrial worker may take a supply  for his own use. Size of unit or container is not the only index of  whether the article is suitable for use in or around the household; the  test shall be whether under any reasonably foreseeable condition of  purchase, storage, or use the article may be found in or around a  dwelling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conspicuously in section 2(p)(1) of the act and prominently and  conspicuous in section 2(p)(2) of the act mean that, under customary  conditions of purchase, storage, and use, the required information shall  be visible, noticeable, and in clear and legible English. Some factors  affecting a warning's prominence and conspicuousness are: Location, size  of type, and contrast of printing against background. Also bearing on  the effectiveness of a warning might be the effect of the package  contents if spilled on the label.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The definitions of extremely flammable, flammable, and  combustible hazardous substances set forth above in paragraphs (b)(10)  and (c)(6) are effective August 10, 1987.
