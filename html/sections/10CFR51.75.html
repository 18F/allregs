                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construction permit stage. A draft environmental impact  statement relating to issuance of a construction permit for a production  or utilization facility will be prepared in accordance with the  procedures and measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, 51.72, and  51.73. The contribution of the environmental effects of the uranium fuel  cycle activities specified in Sec. 51.51 shall be evaluated on the  basis of impact values set forth in Table S-3, Table of Uranium Fuel  Cycle Environmental Data, which shall be set out in the draft  environmental impact statement. With the exception of radon-222 and  technetium-99 releases, no further discussion of fuel cycle release  values and other numerical data that appear explicitly in the   table shall be required.\5\ The impact statement shall take account of  dose commitments and health effects from fuel cycle effluents set forth  in Table S-3 and shall in addition take account of economic,  socioeconomic, and possible cumulative impacts and other fuel cycle  impacts as may reasonably appear significant. As stated in Sec. 51.23,  the generic impact determinations regarding the continued storage of  spent fuel in NUREG-2157 shall be deemed incorporated into the  environmental impact statement. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\5\ Values for releases of Rn-222 and Tc-99 are not given in the  table. The amount and significance of Rn-222 releases from the fuel  cycle and Tc-99 releases from waste management or reprocessing  activities shall be considered in the draft environmental impact  statement and may be the subject of litigation in individual licensing  proceedings. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Early site permit stage. A draft environmental impact statement  relating to issuance of an early site permit for a production or  utilization facility will be prepared in accordance with the procedures  and measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, 51.72, 51.73, and  this section. The contribution of the environmental effects of the  uranium fuel cycle activities specified in Sec. 51.51 shall be  evaluated on the basis of impact values set forth in Table S-3, Table of  Uranium Fuel Cycle Environmental Data, which shall be set out in the  draft environmental impact statement. With the exception of radon-222  and technetium-99 releases, no further discussion of fuel cycle release  values and other numerical data that appear explicitly in the table  shall be required.\5\ The impact statement shall take account of dose  commitments and health effects from fuel cycle effluents set forth in  Table S-3 and shall in addition take account of economic, socioeconomic,  and possible cumulative impacts and other fuel cycle impacts as may  reasonably appear significant. As stated in Sec. 51.23, the generic  impact determinations regarding the continued storage of spent fuel in  NUREG-2157 shall be deemed incorporated into the environmental impact  statement. The draft environmental impact statement must include an  evaluation of alternative sites to determine whether there is any  obviously superior alternative to the site proposed. The draft  environmental impact statement must also include an evaluation of the  environmental effects of construction and operation of a reactor, or  reactors, which have design characteristics that fall within the site  characteristics and design parameters for the early site permit  application, but only to the extent addressed in the early site permit  environmental report or otherwise necessary to determine whether there  is any obviously superior alternative to the site proposed. The draft  environmental impact statement must not include an assessment of the  economic, technical, or other benefits (for example, need for power) and  costs of the proposed action or an evaluation of alternative energy  sources, unless these matters are addressed in the early site permit  environmental report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Combined license stage. A draft environmental impact statement  relating to issuance of a combined license that does not reference an  early site permit will be prepared in accordance with the procedures and  measures described in Sec. Sec. 51.70, 51.71, 51.72, and 51.73. The  contribution of the environmental effects of the uranium fuel cycle  activities specified in Sec. 51.51 shall be evaluated on the basis of  impact values set forth in Table S-3, Table of Uranium Fuel Cycle  Environmental Data, which shall be set out in the draft environmental  impact statement. With the exception of radon-222 and technetium-99  releases, no further discussion of fuel cycle release values and other  numerical data that appear explicitly in the table shall be required.\5\  The impact statement shall take account of dose commitments and health  effects from fuel cycle effluents set forth in Table S-3 and shall in  addition take account of economic, socioeconomic, and possible  cumulative impacts and other fuel cycle impacts as may reasonably appear  significant. As stated in Sec. 51.23, the generic impact determinations  regarding the continued storage of spent fuel in NUREG-2157 shall be  deemed incorporated into the environmental impact statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Combined license application referencing an early site permit.  If the combined license application references an early site permit,  then the NRC staff   shall prepare a draft supplement to the early site permit environmental  impact statement. The supplement must be prepared in accordance with  Sec. 51.92(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Combined license application referencing a standard design  certification. If the combined license application references a standard  design certification and the site characteristics of the combined  license's site fall within the site parameters specified in the design  certification environmental assessment, then the draft combined license  environmental impact statement shall incorporate by reference the design  certification environmental assessment, and summarize the findings and  conclusions of the environmental assessment with respect to severe  accident mitigation design alternatives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Combined license application referencing a manufactured reactor.  If the combined license application proposes to use a manufactured  reactor and the site characteristics of the combined license's site fall  within the site parameters specified in the manufacturing license  environmental assessment, then the draft combined license environmental  impact statement shall incorporate by reference the manufacturing  license environmental assessment, and summarize the findings and  conclusions of the environmental assessment with respect to severe  accident mitigation design alternatives. The combined license  environmental impact statement report will not address the environmental  impacts associated with manufacturing the reactor under the  manufacturing license.
