The device shall be placed on a smooth  surface that can   be inclined at 60 degrees from the horizontal, as shown in Figure 1 of  this section. The height and width of the inclined plane (not including  the portion of the plane below the mechanical stop) shall be at least 1  inch (2.54 cm) greater than the largest dimension of the base of the  device to be tested. The test shall be conducted on a smooth, hard  surface that is horizontal as measured by a spirit level or equivalent  instrument. The mechanical stop on the inclined plane shall be \1/16\  inches (1.6 mm) in height and perpendicular to the inclined plane. The  stop shall be positioned parallel to the bottom edge of the inclined  plane and so that no portion of the device to be tested or its base  touches the horizontal surface. The device shall not tip over when the  plane is inclined at 60-degrees from the horizontal. The procedure shall  be repeated for each edge of the device.</p><p class="depth2">Figure 1 to Sec. 1507.12 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR26MR96.011   [61 FR 13096, Mar. 26, 1996]</p><p class="depth2">Sec.
