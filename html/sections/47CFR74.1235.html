The antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) shall be determined in accordance with Sec.  73.313(d) of this chapter for each of 12 distinct radials, with each radial spaced 30 degrees apart and with the bearing of the first radial bearing true north. Each raidal HAAT value shall be rounded to the nearest meter. For each of the 12 radial directions, the MERP is the value corresponding to the calculated HAAT in the following tables that is appropriate for the location of the translator. For an application specifying a nondirectional transmitting antenna, the specified ERP must not exceed the smallest of the 12 MERP's. For an application specifying a directional transmitting antenna, the ERP in each azimuthal direction must not exceed the MERP for the closest of the 12 radial directions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For FM translators located east of the Mississippi River or in Zone I-A as described in Sec.  73.205(b) of this chapter:
