                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of reports under Sec. 60.7(c), all six-minute periods during which the average opacity is three percent or greater shall indicate a period of excess emission, and shall be reported to the Administrator semi-annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) is not required on any modular, multi-stack, negative-pressure or positive-pressure fabric filter if observations of the opacity of the visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer; or on any single-stack fabric filter if visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer and the owner installs and continuously operates a bag leak detection system according to paragraph (e) of this section. Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be conducted in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to this part. If visible emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average that is in excess of the emission limit specified in Sec. 60.272(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on any

EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 or more consecutive 15-second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any point(s) where visible emissions are observed in proximity to an affected EAF. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A bag leak detection system must be installed and continuously operated on all single-stack fabric filters if the owner or operator elects not to install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator shall meet the visible emissions observation requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. The bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative particulate matter loadings and the owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loading is detected over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each bag leak detection system required by paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority, for approval, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the items identified in paragraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph (e)(4). For each bag leak detection system that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-98-015). The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan shall describe:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output shall be recorded and stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time (if applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided for in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of

the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects including temperature and humidity according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under paragraphs (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If opacities greater than zero percent are observed over four consecutive 15-second observations during the daily opacity observations required under paragraph (c) of this section and the alarm on the bag leak detection system does not sound, the owner or operator shall lower the alarm set point on the bag leak detection system to a point where the alarm would have sounded during the period when the opacity observations were made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For negative pressure, induced air baghouses, and positive pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a stack, the bag leak detection sensor must be installed downstream of the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For each bag leak detection system installed according to paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall initiate procedures to determine the cause of all alarms within 1 hour of an alarm. Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, the cause of the alarm must be alleviated within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In approving the site-specific monitoring plan required in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners or operators more than 3 hours to alleviate specific conditions that cause an alarm if the owner or operator identifies the condition that could lead to an alarm in the monitoring plan, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate the condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred, and demonstrates that the requested additional time will ensure alleviation of the condition as expeditiously as practicable.
