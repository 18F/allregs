                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> New construction projects. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State and local codes,  ordinances, and zoning requirements. Housing that is newly constructed  with HTF funds must meet all applicable State and local codes,  ordinances, and zoning requirements. HTF-assisted new construction  projects must meet State or local residential and building codes, as  applicable or, in the absence of a State or local building code, the  International Residential Code or International Building Code (as  applicable to the type of housing) of the International Code Council.  The housing must meet the applicable requirements upon project  completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (v) of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Accessibility. The housing must meet the accessibility  requirements of 24 CFR part 8, which implements section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and Titles II and III of the  Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12189) implemented at  28 CFR parts 35 and 36, as applicable. ``Covered multifamily  dwellings,'' as defined at 24 CFR 100.201, must also meet the design and  construction requirements at 24 CFR 100.205, which implements the Fair  Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Energy efficiency. The housing must meet the energy efficiency  standards established pursuant to section 109 of the Cranston-Gonzalez  National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12709).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Disaster mitigation. Where relevant, the housing must be  constructed to mitigate the impact of potential disasters (e.g.,  earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires), in accordance with  State and local codes, ordinances, or other State and local  requirements, or such other requirements as HUD may establish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Written cost estimates, construction contracts, and  construction documents. The grantee must ensure the construction  contract(s) and construction documents describe the work to be  undertaken in adequate detail so that inspections can be conducted. The  grantee must review and approve written cost estimates for construction  and determine that costs are reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Construction progress inspections. The grantee must conduct  progress and final inspections of construction to ensure that work is  done in accordance with the applicable codes, the construction contract,  and construction documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rehabilitation standards. The grantee must establish  rehabilitation standards for all HTF-assisted housing rehabilitation  activities that set forth the requirements that the housing must meet  upon project completion. The grantee's description of its standards must  be in sufficient detail to determine the required rehabilitation work  including methods and materials. The standards may refer to applicable  codes or they may establish requirements that exceed the minimum  requirements of the codes. The rehabilitation standards must address  each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Health and safety. The grantee's standards must identify life- threatening deficiencies that must be addressed immediately if the  housing is occupied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Major systems. Major systems are: structural support; roofing;  cladding and weatherproofing (e.g., windows, doors, siding, gutters);  plumbing; electrical; and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.  For rental housing, the grantee's standards must require the grantee to  estimate (based on age and condition) the remaining useful life of these  systems, upon project completion of each major system. For multifamily  housing projects of 26 units or more, the grantee's standards must  require the grantee to determine the useful life of major systems  through a capital needs assessment of the project. For rental housing,  if the remaining useful life of one or more major system is less than  the applicable period of affordability, the grantee's standards must  require the grantee to ensure that a replacement reserve is established  and monthly payments are made to the reserve that are adequate to repair  or replace the systems as needed. For homeownership housing, the  grantee's standards must require, upon project completion, each of the  major systems to have a remaining useful life for a minimum of 5 years  or for such longer period specified by grantee, or the major systems  must be rehabilitated or replaced as part of the rehabilitation work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lead-based paint. The grantee's standards must require the  housing to meet the lead-based paint requirements at 24 CFR part 35.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Accessibility.

Rehabilitation may include  improvements that are not required by regulation or statute that permit  use by a person with disabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> [Reserved].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Disaster mitigation. Where relevant, the grantee's standards  must require the housing to be improved to mitigate the impact of  potential disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricanes, flooding, and  wildfires) in accordance with State and local codes, ordinances, and  requirements, or such other requirements as HUD may establish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> State and local codes, ordinances, and zoning requirements.  The grantee's standards must require the housing to meet all applicable  State and local codes, ordinances, and requirements or, in the absence  of a State or local building code, the International Existing Building  Code of the International Code Council.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Uniform Physical Condition Standards. The standards of the  grantee must be such that, upon completion, the HTF-assisted project and  units will be decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair as described in  24 CFR 5.703. HUD will establish the minimum deficiencies that must be  corrected under the grantee's rehabilitation standards based on  inspectable items and inspected areas from HUD-prescribed physical  inspection procedures (Uniform Physical Conditions Standards) pursuant  to 24 CFR 5.705.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Capital Needs Assessments. For multifamily rental housing  projects of 26 or more total units, the grantee must determine all work  that will be performed in the rehabilitation of the housing and the  long-term physical needs of the project through a capital needs  assessment of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Construction documents and cost estimates. The grantee must  ensure that the work to be undertaken will meet the grantee's  rehabilitation standards. The construction documents (i.e., written  scope of work to be performed) must be in sufficient detail to establish  the basis for a uniform inspection of the housing to determine  compliance with the grantee's standards. The grantee must review and  approve a written cost estimate for rehabilitation after determining  that costs are reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Frequency of inspections. The grantee must conduct an initial  property inspection to identify the deficiencies that must be addressed.  The grantee must conduct progress and final inspections to determine  that work was done in accordance with work write-ups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition of standard housing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Existing housing that is  acquired with HTF assistance for rental housing, and that was newly  constructed or rehabilitated less than 12 months before the date of  commitment of HTF funds, must meet the property standards of paragraph  (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable, for new  construction and rehabilitation projects. The grantee must document this  compliance based upon a review of approved building plans and  Certificates of Occupancy, and an inspection that is conducted no  earlier than 90 calendar days before the date of commitment of HTF  assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All other existing housing that is acquired with HTF assistance  for rental housing must meet the rehabilitation property standards  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The grantee must document  this compliance based upon an inspection that is conducted no earlier  than 90 calendar days before the date of commitment of HTF assistance.  If the property does not meet these standards, HTF funds cannot be used  to acquire the property unless it is rehabilitated to meet the standards  of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> or it cannot be assisted with HTF funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Manufactured housing. Construction of all manufactured housing  (including manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard  unit under the definition of ``reconstruction'') must meet the  Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards codified at 24 CFR  part 3280. These standards preempt State and local codes which are not  identical to the Federal standards for the new construction of  manufactured housing. The grantees providing HTF funds to assist  manufactured housing units must comply with applicable State and local  laws or codes. In the absence of such laws or codes, the installation  must comply with the manufacturer's written instructions for  installation of manufactured housing units. All new manufactured housing  and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit  under the definition of ``reconstruction'' must be on a permanent  foundation that meets the requirements for foundation systems as set  forth in 24 CFR 203.43f(c)(i). All new manufactured housing (and all  manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under  the definition of ``reconstruction'') must, at the time of project  completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on  land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for  which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least  equal to the applicable period of affordability. In HTF-funded  rehabilitation of existing manufactured housing the foundation and  anchoring must meet all applicable State and local codes, ordinances,  and requirements or in the absence of local or State codes, the Model  Manufactured Home Installation Standards at 24 CFR part 3285.  Manufactured housing that is rehabilitated using HTF funds must meet the  property standards requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, as  applicable. The grantee must document this compliance in accordance with  inspection procedures that the grantee has established pursuant to Sec.  92.301, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Ongoing property condition standards: Rental housing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Ongoing property standards. The grantee must establish property  standards for rental housing (including manufactured housing) that apply  throughout the affordability period. The standards must ensure that  owners maintain the housing as decent, safe, and sanitary housing in  good repair. The grantee's description of its property standards must be  in sufficient detail to establish the basis for a uniform inspection of  HTF rental projects. The grantee's ongoing property standards must  address each of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At a minimum, the grantee's ongoing property standards must  include all inspectable items and inspectable areas specified by HUD  based on the HUD physical inspection procedures (Uniform Physical  Condition Standards (UPCS)) prescribed by HUD pursuant to 24 CFR 5.705.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Health and safety. The grantee's standards must require the  housing to be free of all health and safety defects. The standards must  identify life-threatening deficiencies that the owner must immediately  correct and the time frames for addressing these deficiencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lead-based paint. The grantee's standards must require the  housing to meet the lead-based paint requirements in 24 CFR part 35.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inspections. The grantee must undertake ongoing property  inspections, in accordance with Sec. 93.404.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Corrective and remedial actions. The grantee must have  procedures for ensuring that timely corrective and remedial actions are  taken by the project owner to address identified deficiencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inspection procedures. The grantee must establish written  inspection procedures. The procedures must include detailed inspection  checklists, description of how and by whom inspections will be carried  out, and procedures for training and certifying qualified inspectors.  The procedures must also describe how frequently the property will be  inspected, consistent with section Sec. 93.404(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Environmental provisions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> New construction projects  environmental requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Historic preservation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Standards.  The project activities (including demolition) must not be performed on  properties that are either listed in or determined eligible for listing  in the National Register of Historic Places, unless the project  activities meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for  Rehabilitation, either as certified through the Federal and/or State  historic rehabilitation tax credit programs or as verified by someone  that meets the relevant Secretary of the Interior's Professional  Qualification Standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Archaeological resources. If archaeological resources or human  remains are discovered on the project site during construction, the  grantee must consult with affected tribes and/or descendant communities  and comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation  Act (25 U.S.C. 3001-3013), State law and/or local ordinance (e.g., State  unmarked burial law).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Farmland.

Plans are available from  the local coastal zone management agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Floodplains. Except as modified below, definitions for terms  used below can be found at 24 CFR part 55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Construction and other activities in the 100-year floodplain are  to be avoided when practicable. If there are no practicable alternatives  to new construction or substantial improvement in the 100-year  floodplain, the structure must be elevated at least the base flood  elevation (BFE) or floodproofed to one foot above the BFE. Elevated and  floodproofed buildings must adhere to National Flood Insurance Program  standards. The primary sources of floodplain data are Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). When FEMA  provides interim flood hazard data, such as Advisory Base Flood  Elevations (ABFE) or preliminary maps or studies, the latest of these  sources shall be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No HTF assistance may be approved with respect to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any action, other than a functionally dependent use, located in  a floodway;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any new construction critical action located in a coastal high  hazard area, 100- or 500-year floodplain; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any non-critical new construction action in a coastal high  hazard area, unless the action is reconstruction following destruction  caused by a disaster and is designed for location in a coastal high  hazard area consistent with the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program  requirements for V-Zones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Wetlands. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No draining, dredging, channelizing, filling,  diking, impounding, or related grading activities are to be performed in  wetlands. No activities, structures, or facilities funded under this  program are to adversely impact a wetland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A wetland means those areas that are inundated by surface or  ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and under normal  circumstances, does or would support a prevalence of vegetative or  aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil  conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include  swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such as sloughs, potholes,   wet meadows, river overflows, mud flats, and natural ponds. This  definition includes those wetland areas separated from their natural  supply of water as a result of activities, such as the construction of  structural flood protection methods or solid-fill road beds, or mineral  extraction and navigation improvements. This definition is independent  of the definition of jurisdictional wetland used by the U. S. Army Corps  of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et  seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Explosives and hazards. Projects must be in compliance with  the standards for acceptable separation distance, as set forth at 24 CFR  part 51, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Contamination. All properties assisted with HTF funds must be  free of hazardous materials, contamination, toxic chemicals and gases,  and radioactive substances, where a hazard could affect the health and  safety of occupants or conflict with the intended use of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All proposed multifamily (more than four housing units) HTF  projects require a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA-ASTM). If  the Phase I ESA identifies recognized environmental concerns (RECs), a  Phase II (ESA-ASTM) will be required. ASTM reports shall be prepared in  accordance with the most current ASTM standard. Single family housing  does not require a Phase I ESA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> HTF projects must avoid sites located within 0.25 miles of a  Superfund or CERCLIS (Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Information System) site or other  contaminated site reported to Federal, State, or local authorities  without a statement in writing from the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) or the appropriate State agency that there is no hazard  that could affect the health and safety of the occupants or conflict  with the intended use of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Noise. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Internal noise levels: All activities will be  developed to ensure an interior noise level of no more than 45 decibels  (dB).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> External noise levels:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Project sites exposed to less than or equal to 65 dB of  environmental noise are acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sites between 65 dB and less than 75 dB are acceptable with  mitigation (e.g., noise walls, careful site planning) that result in an  interior standard of 45 dB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Locations with environmental noise levels of 75 dB or greater  may not have noise sensitive outdoor uses (e.g., picnic areas, tot lots,  balconies, or patios) and require sound attenuation in the building  shell to achieve the 45 dB interior standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Endangered species. The grantee must avoid all actions which  could jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened  species, as designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National  Marine Fisheries Service, or would result in the destruction or  adversely modify the designated critical habitat of such species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Wild and scenic rivers. The grantee must avoid activities that  are inconsistent with conservation easements, land-use protections, and  restrictions adjacent to wild and scenic rivers, as designated/listed by  the Departments of Agriculture or Interior. Maps for the National Wild  and Scenic Rivers System are available at the governing departments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Safe drinking water. Projects with a potable water system  must use only lead-free pipes, solder, and flux.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Sole-source aquifers. Project activities should avoid sites  and activities that have the potential to contaminate sole source  aquifer areas (SSAs). EPA defines a sole or principal source aquifer as  an aquifer that supplies at least 50 percent of the drinking water  consumed in the area overlying the aquifer. If the project overlies an  SSA, EPA must review the project. EPA review is designed to reduce the  risk of ground water contamination that could pose a health hazard to  those who use it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rehabilitation projects environmental requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Historic  preservation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The project activities (including demolition) must not  be performed on properties that are either listed in or determined  eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic   Places, unless the project activities meet the Secretary of the  Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, either as certified through the  Federal and/or State historic rehabilitation tax credit programs or as  verified by someone that meets the relevant Secretary of the Interior's  Professional Qualification Standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Archaeological resources.
