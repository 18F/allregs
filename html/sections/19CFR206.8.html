                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification. Any person submitting factual information on behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party for the consideration of the Commission in the course of an investigation to which this part pertains, and any person submitting a response to a Commission questionnaire issued in connection with an investigation to which this part pertains, must certify that such information is accurate and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Service. Any party submitting a document for the consideration of the Commission in the course of an investigation to which this part pertains shall, in addition to complying with Sec. 201.8 of this chapter, serve a copy of the public version of such document on all other parties to the investigation in the manner prescribed in Sec. 201.16 of this chapter, and, when appropriate, serve a copy of the confidential version of such document in the manner provided for in Sec. 206.17(f). The Secretary shall promptly notify a petitioner when, before the establishment of a service list under Sec. 206.17(a)(4), an application under Sec. 206.17(a) is approved. When practicable, this notification shall be made by facsimile transmission. A copy of the petition including all confidential business information shall then be served by petitioner on those approved applicants in accordance with this section within two (2) calendar days of the time notification is made by the Secretary. If a document is filed before the Secretary's issuance of the service list provided for in Sec. 201.11 of this chapter or the administrative protective order list provided for in Sec. 206.17, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the document shall be served on all appropriate parties within two (2) days of the issuance of the service list or the administrative protective order list and a certificate of service shall then be filed. Notwithstanding Sec. 201.16 of this chapter, petitions, briefs, and testimony filed by parties shall be served by hand or, if served by mail, by overnight mail or its equivalent. Failure to comply with the requirements of this rule may result in removal from status as a party to the investigation. The Commission shall make available, upon request, to all parties to the investigation a copy of each document, except transcripts of hearings, confidential business information, privileged information, and information required to be served under this section, placed in the docket file of the investigation by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filing. Documents to be filed with the Commission must comply with applicable rules, including Sec. 201.8 of this chapter. If the Commission establishes a deadline for the filing of a document, and the submitter includes confidential business information in the document, the submitter is to file and, if the submitter is a party, serve the confidential version of the document on the deadline and may file and serve the nonconfidential version of the document no later than one business day after the deadline for filing the document. The confidential version shall enclose all confidential business information in brackets and have the following warning marked on every page: ``Bracketing of CBI not final for one business day after date of filing.'' The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date of filing of the document, i.e., at the same time as the nonconfidential version of the document is due to be filed. Until the bracketing becomes final, recipients of the document may not divulge any part of the contents of the document to anyone not subject to the administrative protective order issued in the investigation. If the submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, the submitter may file a corrected version or portion of the confidential document at the same time as the nonconfidential version is filed. No changes to the document other than bracketing and deletion of confidential business information are permitted after the deadline. Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the striking of all or a portion of a submitter's document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Briefs. All briefs filed in proceedings subject to this part shall be filed electronically, and eight (8) true paper copies shall be filed on the same business day.
