A reporting entity may request a 30 day extension to submit its report. FTA will treat a failure to submit the required report by the due date or the extension date as failure to report data under Sec. 630.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Incomplete reports. FTA will treat an NTD submission that does not contain all of the required data; or does not contain the required certifications, where applicable; or that is not in substantial conformance with the definitions, procedures, and format requirements set out in the reference documents as a failure to report data under Sec. 630.5, unless the reporting entity has exhausted all possibilities for obtaining this information.</p>
