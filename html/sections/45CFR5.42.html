                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We may charge search fees even if the records we find are exempt from disclosure, or even if we do not find any records at all.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If we are not charging you for the first two hours of search time, under Sec. 5.41(c), and those two hours are spent on a computer search, then the two free hours are the first two hours of the operator's own operation. If the operator spends less than two hours on the search, we well reduce the total search fees by the average hourly rate for the operator's time, multipled by two.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we are not charging you for the first 100 pages of duplication, under Sec. 5.41 (b) or (c), then those 100 pages are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages of computer printout. If we cannot use this method to calculate the fee reduction, then we will reduce your total duplication fee by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will not charge you any fee at all if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. As of May 1987, such costs among the units HHS ranged between $6.00 and $12.50.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If we determine that you (acting either alone or together with others) are breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, we may aggregate all these requests for purposes of calculating the fees charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We will charge interest on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. We will use the provisions of part 30 of this title in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties and in taking actions to encourage payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This subpart does not apply to requests for Social Security program records on Social Security number

holders, wage earners, employers, and claimants, where the requests are governed by section 1106 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306(c), and by 20 CFR 442.441.</p>
