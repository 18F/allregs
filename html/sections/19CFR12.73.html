                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability of EPA requirements. This section is ancillary to  the regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued  under the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), and found  in 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. Those regulations should be consulted for  more detailed information concerning EPA emission requirements. The  requirements apply to imported motor vehicles, but do not apply to  separately imported non-chassis mounted engines to be used in light-duty  trucks or other light-duty vehicles. Other separately imported engines  for heavy-duty motor vehicles are covered, and all references in this  section to motor vehicles should be deemed to include motor vehicles as  well as these heavy-duty engines. Nothing in this section should be  construed as limiting or changing in any way the applicability of the  EPA regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Importation of complying vehicles--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Labeled vehicles.  Vehicles which in their condition as imported are covered by an EPA  certificate of conformity and which bear the manufacturer's label  showing such conformity and other EPA-required information shall be  deemed in compliance with applicable emission requirements for the  purpose of Customs admissibility and entry liquidation determinations.  This paragraph does not apply to importations of ICI's covered by  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pending certification. Vehicles otherwise covered by paragraph  (b)(1) of this section which were manufactured for compliance with  applicable emission requirements, but for which an application for a  certificate of conformity is pending with the EPA may be conditionally  released from Customs custody pending production of the certificate of  conformity within 120 days of release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Importation of vehicles previously in compliance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vehicles  of returning residents. Vehicles of residents returning from Canada,  Mexico or other countries as EPA may designate are not covered by this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vehicles of commuting nonresidents and tourists. A port director  through the issuance of an appropriate means of identification to be  affixed to a vehicle may waive all of the requirements of this section  for a nonresident regularly crossing the Canadian or Mexican border, or  waive the requirements for Mexico or Canadian-registered vehicles of  tourists or other travelers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participants in EPA-approved catalytic converter or oxygen  sensor control programs. Further evidence of emissions compliance will  not be required for catalytic converter or oxygen sensor-equipped  vehicles imported for participating in EPA-approved catalytic converter  or oxygen sensor control programs and subject to the requirements of  those programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Previously labeled, modified or imported vehicles. Any other  vehicle of United States or foreign origin manufactured with a catalytic  converter or oxygen sensor, or any previously imported vehicle  subsequently modified with a catalytic converter or oxygen sensor, will  not be deemed in compliance with applicable emission requirements if  used outside of the United States, Canada, Mexico, or other countries as  EPA may designate, until the catalytic converter and/or oxygen sensor is  replaced. Conditional release from Customs custody for the purpose of  the modification is subject to a 120-day period for completion. Subject  to special documentation at the time of export from the United States  and approval and other requirements of EPA, replacement of a catalytic  converter or oxygen sensor may be avoided if the equipment is  disconnected before export from the United States and reconnected after  subsequent importation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Importation of vehicles by ICI's. Except for motor vehicles  imported in the   applicable circumstances covered by paragraphs (c), (e), (f), (g) or (h)  of this section, an individual or business other than an independent  commercial importer (ICI) holding a currently valid EPA certificate of  conformity may not enter a motor vehicle which does not conform with EPA  emission requirements. An ICI, subject to the more specific definition  in EPA regulations, is an importer which does not have a contract with a  foreign or domestic motor vehicle manufacturer for distributing products  into the United States market. However, a motor vehicle may not be  conditionally admitted unless it falls within one of the categories  provided for in 40 CFR 85.1505 or 85.1509. Before the vehicle is deemed  to be in compliance with applicable emission requirements and,  therefore, finally admitted into the United States, the ICI must keep  the vehicle in storage for a 15-working day period. This period follows  notice to EPA of completion of the compliance work to give EPA the  opportunity to conduct confirmatory testing and inspect the vehicle and  records. The 15-working day period is part of the 120-day period in  which an ICI must bring the vehicle into emissions compliance.  Individuals and businesses not entitled to enter nonconforming motor  vehicles may arrange for their importation through an ICI certificate  holder. In these circumstances, the ICI will not act as an agent or  broker for Customs transaction purposes unless otherwise licensed or  authorized to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemptions and exclusions from emission requirements based on  age of vehicle. The following motor vehicles, except as shown, may be  imported by any person and do not have to be shown to be in compliance  with emission requirements or modified before entitled to admissibility:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gasoline-fueled light-duty trucks and light-duty motor vehicles  manufactured before January 1, 1968;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Diesel-fueled light-duty motor vehicles manufactured before  January 1, 1975;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Diesel-fueled light-duty trucks manufactured before January 1,  1976;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Motorcycles manufactured before January 1, 1978;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Gasoline-fueled and diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines  manufactured before January 1, 1970; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Motor vehicles not otherwsie exempt from EPA emission  requirements and more than 20 years old. Age is determined by  subtracting the year of production (as opposed to model year) from the  year of importation. The exemption under this subparagraph is available  only if the vehicle is imported by an ICI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exemption for exports. A motor vehicle intended solely for  export to a country not having the same emission standards applicable in  the United States, and both the vehicle and its container bear a label  or tag indicating that it is intended solely for export, is exempt from  applicable United States emission requirements. 40 CFR 85.1709.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exemptions for diplomats, foreign military personnel and  nonresidents. Subject to the condition that they are not resold in the  United States, the following motor vehicles are exempt from applicable  emission requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A motor vehicle imported solely for the personal use of a  nonresident importer or consignee and the use will be for a period not  to exceed one year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A motor vehicle of a member of the armed forces of a foreign  country on assignment in the United States, or of a member of the  personnel of a foreign government on assignment in the United States or  other individual who comes within the class of persons for whom free  entry of motor vehicles has been authorized by the Department of State  in accordance with general principles of international law. For special  documentation requirements see paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exemptions and exclusions based on prior EPA authorization. The  following motor vehicles are exempt or excluded from applicable emission  requirements if prior approval has been obtained in writing from EPA:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. This exemption is limited to a period  not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is  made under 40 CFR 85.1705(f) for a one-year extension;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> and  85.1706. In the case of an ICI, unless the vehicle is brought into  conformity within 180 days from the date of entry it shall be exported  or otherwise disposed of subject to paragraph (1) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Racing cars. Any motor vehicle which qualifies as a racing  vehicle meeting one or more of the criteria found at 40 CFR 85.1703(a),  and which will not be registered or licensed for use on or operated on  public roads or highways in the United States. See also 40 CFR  85.1511(c)(1);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> National security importations. Any motor vehicle imported for  purposes of national security by a manufacturer. 40 CFR 85.1511(c)(2),  85.1702(a)(2) and 85.1708; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Hardship exemption. Any motor vehicle imported by anyone  qualifying for a hardship exemption. 40 CFR 85.1511(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Documentation requirements--(1) Exception for manufacturers. The  special documentation requirements of this paragraph do not apply to the  entry of any motor vehicles shown to be in compliance with applicable  emission requirements under paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section relating to  labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Declarations of other importers. Release from Customs custody  shall be refused with respect to all other entries unless there is filed  with the entry in duplicate a declaration in which the importer or  consignee declares or affirms its status as an original equipment  manufacturer, an ICI holding an applicable certificate of conformity, or  other status, and further declares or affirms the status or condition of  the imported vehicles and the circumstances concerning importation  including a citation to the specific paragraph or subparagraph in this  section upon which application for conditional or final release from  Customs custody is applied for.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other documentation and information. An importer's declaration  shall include or be submitted with the following further information and  documentation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> The importer's name and address and telephone number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Identification of the vehicle or engine number, the vehicle  owner's taxpayer identification number, and his or her current address  and telephone number in the United States if different than as provided  for in paragraph (3)(A) of this paragraph;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(C)</em> Identification, where applicable, of the place where the vehicle  will be stored until EPA approval of the importer's application to EPA  for final admission as required for vehicles imported under 40 CFR  85.1505, 85.1509, or 85.1512 having reference to certain importations  under paragraphs (c)(4) or (d)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(D)</em> Authorization for EPA enforcement officers to conduct  inspections or testing otherwise permitted by the Clean Air Act and  regulations promulgated thereunder;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(E)</em> Identification, where applicable, of the certificate of  conformity by means of which the vehicle is being imported;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(F)</em> The date of manufacture of the vehicle;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(G)</em> The date of entry;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(H)</em> Identification of the vessel or carrier on which the merchandise  was shipped;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(I)</em> The entry number where applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(J)</em> Where prior EPA authorization is required for an exemption or  exclusion, a copy of that authorization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(K)</em> Such other further information as may be required by the EPA or  the Customs Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documentation from diplomats and foreign military personnel. For  entries for which an exemption is claimed   under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, there must also be attached to  the declaration required under paragraph (i)(2) of this section a copy  of the motor vehicle importer's official orders, if any, or if a  qualifying member of the personnel of a foreign government on assignment  in the United States, the name of the embassy to which the importer is  accredited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Release under bond. If a declaration filed in accordance with  paragraph (i)(2) of this section states that the entry is being filed  under circumstances described in either paragraph (c)(4), (h)(1),  (h)(2), (h)(3) or (h)(4) of this section, the entry shall be accepted  only if the importer or consignee gives a bond on Customs Form 301,  containing the bond condition set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter  for the production of an EPA statement that the vehicle or engine is in  conformity with Federal emission requirements. Within the period in  paragraph (h)(2), (h)(3) or (c)(4) of this section, or in the case of  paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(4) of this section, the period specified by EPA  in its authorization for an exemption, or such additional period as the  port director may allow for good cause shown, the importer or consignee  shall deliver to the port director the prescribed statement. If the  statement is not delivered to the director of the port of entry within  the specified period, the importer or consignee shall deliver or cause  to be delivered to the port director those vehicles which were released  under a bond required by this paragraph. In the event that the vehicle  or engine is not redelivered within five days following the date  specified in the preceding sentence, liquidated damages shall be  assessed in the full amount of the bond, if it is a single entry bond,  or if a continuous bond is used, the amount that would have been taken  under a single entry bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notices of inadmissibility or detention. If a motor vehicle is  determined to be inadmissible before release from Customs custody, or  inadmissible after release from Customs custody, the importer or  consignee shall be notified in writing of the inadmissibility  determination and/or redelivery requirement. However, if a motor vehicle  cannot be released from Customs custody merely because the importer has  failed to attach to the entry the documentation required by paragraph  (i) of this section, the vehicle shall be held in detention by the  director of a period not to exceed 30 days after filing of the entry at  the risk and expense of the importer pending submission of the missing  documentation. An additional 30-day extension may be granted by the port  director upon application for good cause shown. If at the expiration of  a period not over 60 days the documentation has not been filed, a notice  of inadmissibility will be issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Disposal of vehicles not entitled to admission. A motor vehicle  denied admission under any provision of this section shall be disposed  of in accordance with applicable Customs laws and regulations. However,  a motor vehicle or engine will not be disposed of in a manner in which  it may ultimately either directly or indirectly reach a consumer in a  condition in which it is not in conformity with applicable EPA emission  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Prohibited importations. The importation of motor vehicles  otherwise than in accordance with this section and the regulations of  EPA in 40 CFR parts 80, 85, 86 and 600 is prohibited.  [T.D. 88-40, 53 FR 26240, July 12, 1988, as amended by T.D. 01-14, 66 FR  8767, Feb. 2, 2001]</p>
