                            <p class="depth0">In processing a request for information classified under Executive  Order 13526 or any other executive order concerning the classification  of records, the information shall be reviewed to determine whether it  should remain classified. Ordinarily the component or other Federal  agency that classified the information should conduct the review, except  that if a record contains information that has been derivatively  classified by a component because it contains information classified by  another component or agency, the component shall refer the  responsibility for responding to the request to the component or agency  that classified the underlying information. Information determined to no  longer require classification shall not be withheld on the basis of FOIA  exemption (b)(1) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)), but should be reviewed to assess  whether any other FOIA exemption should be invoked. Appeals involving  classified information shall be processed in accordance with Sec.  4.10(c).  [79 FR 62560, Oct. 20, 2014]</p>
