A prospective applicant may confer informally with the NRC staff before filing an application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An application for a permit, a license, a license transfer, a license amendment, a license renewal, or a standard design approval, shall be filed with the Director, Office of New Reactors, the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, or the Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as prescribed by the applicable provisions of this chapter. A prospective applicant may confer informally with the NRC staff before filing an application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each application for a license for a facility or for receipt of waste radioactive material from other persons for the purpose of commercial disposal by the waste disposal licensee will be assigned a docket number. However, to allow a determination as to whether an application for a limited work authorization, construction permit, operating license, early site permit, standard design approval, combined license, or manufacturing license for a production or utilization facility is complete and acceptable for docketing, it will be initially treated as a tendered application. A copy of the tendered application will be available for public inspection at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov, and/or at the NRC PDR. Generally, the determination on acceptability for docketing will be made within a period of 30 days. However, in selected applications, the Commission may decide to determine acceptability based on the technical adequacy of the application as well as its completeness. In these cases, the Commission, under Sec. 2.104(a), will direct that the notice of hearing be issued as soon as practicable after the application has been tendered, and the determination of acceptability will be made generally within a period of 60 days. For docketing and other requirements for applications under part 61 of this chapter, see paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Director, Office of New Reactors, or Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, determines that a tendered application for a construction permit or operating license for a production or utilization facility, and/or any environmental report required pursuant to subpart A of part 51 of this chapter, or part thereof as provided in paragraphs (a)(5) or (a-1) of this section are complete and acceptable for docketing, a docket number will be assigned to the application or part thereof, and

the applicant will be notified of the determination. With respect to the tendered application and/or environmental report or part thereof that is acceptable for docketing, the applicant will be requested to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Submit to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Director, Office of New Reactors, or Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, such additional copies as the regulations in part 50 and subpart A of part 51 of this chapter require;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Serve a copy on the chief executive of the municipality in which the facility or site which is the subject of an early site permit is to be located or, if the facility or site which is the subject of an early site permit is not to be located within a municipality, on the chief executive of the county, and serve a notice of availability of the application or environmental report on the chief executives of the municipalities or counties which have been identified in the application or environmental report as the location of all or part of the alternative sites, containing as applicable, the docket number of the application; a brief description of the proposed site and facility; the location of the site and facility as primarily proposed and alternatively listed; the name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available) of the applicant's representative who may be contacted for further information; notification that a draft environmental impact statement will be issued by the Commission and will be made available upon request to the Commission; and notification that if a request is received from the appropriate chief executive, the applicant will transmit a copy of the application and environmental report, and any changes to these documents which affect the alternative site location, to the executive who makes the request. In complying with the requirements of this paragraph, the applicant should not make public distribution of those parts of the application subject to Sec. 2.390(d). The applicant shall submit to the Director, Office of New Reactors or Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, as appropriate, an affidavit that service of the notice of availability of the application or environmental report has been completed along with a list of names and addresses of those executives upon whom the notice was served; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Make direct distribution of additional copies to Federal, State, and local officials in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and written instructions furnished to the applicant by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Director, Office of New Reactors, or Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate.
