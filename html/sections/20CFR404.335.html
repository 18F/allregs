                                Sec. 404.335  How do I become entitled to widow's or widower's benefits?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">We will find you entitled to benefits as the widow or widower of a  person who died fully insured if you meet the requirements in paragraphs  (a) through (e) of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your relationship to the insured as a wife or husband lasted for  at least   9 months immediately before the insured died.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the time of your marriage the insured was reasonably expected  to live for 9 months, and the death of the insured was accidental. The  death is accidental if it was caused by an event that the insured did  not expect, if it was the result of bodily injuries received from  violent and external causes, and if, as a direct result of these  injuries, death occurred not later than 3 months after the day on which  the bodily injuries were received. An intentional and voluntary suicide  will not be considered an accidental death.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of your marriage the insured was reasonably  expected to live for 9 months, and the death of the insured occurred in  the line of duty while he or she was serving on active duty as a member  of the uniformed services as defined in Sec. 404.1019.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the time of your marriage the insured was reasonably  expected to live for 9 months, and you had been previously married to  the insured for at least 9 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The insured had been married prior to his or her marriage to  you and the prior spouse was institutionalized during the marriage to  the insured due to mental incompetence or similar incapacity. During the  period of the prior spouse's institutionalization, the insured, as  determined based on evidence satisfactory to the Agency, would have  divorced the prior spouse and married you, but the insured did not do so  because the divorce would have been unlawful, by reason of the  institutionalization, under the laws of the State in which the insured  was domiciled at the time. Additionally, the prior spouse must have  remained institutionalized up to the time of his or her death and the  insured must have married you within 60 days after the prior spouse's  death.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You and the insured were the natural parents of a child; or you  were married to the insured when either of you adopted the other's child  or when both of you adopted a child who was then under 18 years old.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the month before you married the insured, you were entitled  to or, if you had applied and had been old enough, could have been  entitled to any of these benefits or payments: widow's, widower's,  father's (based on the record of a fully insured individual), mother's  (based on the record of a fully insured individual), wife's, husband's,  parent's, or disabled child's benefits; or annuity payments under the  Railroad Retirement Act for widows, widowers, parents, or children age  18 or older.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are entitled to wife's or husband's benefits for the month  before the month in which the insured dies and you have attained full  retirement age (as defined in Sec. 404.409) or you are not entitled to  either old-age or disability benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You are entitled to mother's or father's benefits for the month  before the month in which you attained full retirement age (as defined  in Sec. 404.409).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are entitled to wife's or husband's benefits and to either  old-age or disability benefits in the month before the month of the  insured's death, you are under full retirement age (as defined in  Sec. 404.409) in the month of death, and you have filed a Certificate of  Election in which you elect to receive reduced widow's or widower's  benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em>  and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You were entitled to disability insurance benefits for December  1990, or eligible for supplemental security income or federally  administered State supplementary payments, as specified in subparts B  and T of part 416 of this chapter, respectively, for January 1991.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You were found not disabled for any month based on the  definition of disability in Secs. 404.1577 and 404.1578, as in effect  prior to January 1991, but would have been entitled if the standard in  Sec. 404.1505(a) had applied. (This exception to the requirement for  filing an   application is effective only with respect to benefits payable for  months after December 1990.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your disability started not later than 7 years after the insured  died or 7 years after you were last entitled to mother's or father's  benefits or to widow's or widower's benefits based upon a disability,  whichever occurred last.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Your disability continued during a waiting period of 5 full  consecutive months, unless months beginning with the first month of  eligibility for supplemental security income or federally administered  State supplementary payments are counted, as explained in the Exception  in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The waiting period may begin no  earlier than the 17th month before you applied; the fifth month before  the insured died; or if you were previously entitled to mother's,  father's, widow's, or widower's benefits, the 5th month before your  entitlement to benefits ended. If you were previously entitled to  widow's or widower's benefits based upon a disability, no waiting period  is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception: For monthly benefits payable for months after  December 1990, if you were or have been eligible for supplemental  security income or federally administered State supplementary payments,  as specified in subparts B and T of part 416 of this chapter,  respectively, your disability need not have continued through a  separate, full 5-month waiting period before you may begin receiving  benefits. We will include as months of the 5-month waiting period the  months in a period beginning with the first month you received  supplemental security income or a federally administered State  supplementary payment and continuing through all succeeding months,  regardless of whether the months in the period coincide with the months  in which your waiting period would have occurred, or whether you  continued to be eligible for supplemental security income or a federally  administered State supplementary payment after the period began, or  whether you met the nondisability requirements for entitlement to  widow's or widower's benefits. However, we will not pay you benefits  under this provision for any month prior to January 1991.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You have not previously received 36 months of payments based on  disability when drug addiction or alcoholism was a contributing factor  material to the determination of disability (as described in  Sec. 404.1535), regardless of the number of entitlement periods you may  have had, or your current application for widow's or widower's benefits  is not based on a disability where drug addiction or alcoholism is a  contributing factor material to the determination of disability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You are not entitled to an old-age benefit that is equal to or  larger than the insured person's primary insurance amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> through (3) of this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You remarried after you became 60 years old.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You remarried after attaining age 50 but before attaining age  60.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the remarriage, you were entitled to widow's or  widower's benefits as a disabled widow or widower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You remarried after attaining age 50.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You met the disability requirements in paragraph (c) of this  section at the time of your remarriage (i.e., your disability began  within the specified time and before your remarriage).
