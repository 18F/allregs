Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions  that apply for purposes of section 833(c)(5) and this section. Paragraph  (c) of this section provides rules for computing an organization's MLR  under section 833(c)(5). Paragraph (d) of this section addresses the  treatment under section 833 of an organization that has an MLR of less  than 85 percent. Paragraph (e) of this section provides the effective/ applicability date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  section 833(c)(5) and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees.

The term total premium revenue means the  total amount of premium revenue (excluding Federal and State taxes and  licensing or regulatory fees and after accounting for payments or  receipts for risk adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance under  sections 1341, 1342, and 1343 of the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act, Public Law 111-148 (124 Stat. 119 (2010)) (42 U.S.C. sections  18061, 18062, and 18063)) as those terms are used for purposes of  section 300gg-18(b) of title 42, United States Code and the regulations  issued under that section (see 45 CFR Part 158).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> MLR numerator. The numerator of an organization's MLR is the  total premium revenue expended on reimbursement for clinical services  provided to enrollees under its policies for the taxable year, computed  using a three-year period in the same manner as those expenses are  computed for the plan year for purposes of section 300gg-18(b) of title  42, United States Code and regulations issued under that section (see 45  CFR Part 158).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> MLR denominator. The denominator of an organization's MLR is  the   organization's total premium revenue for the taxable year, computed  using a three-year period in the same manner as the total premium  revenue is computed for the plan year for purposes of section 300gg- 18(b) of title 42, United States Code and regulations issued under that  section (see 45 CFR Part 158).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section apply solely for the first taxable year  beginning after December 31, 2013, and the first taxable year beginning  after December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013. For the  first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013, the numerator of  an organization's MLR is the total premium revenue expended on  reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees under its  policies for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013,  and the denominator of an organization's MLR is the organization's total  premium revenue for the first taxable year beginning after December 31,  2013.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> First taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014. For the  first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014, the numerator of  an organization's MLR is the sum of the total premium revenue expended  on reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees under its  policies for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2013,  and for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2014, and  the denominator of an organization's MLR is the sum of the  organization's total premium revenue for the first taxable year  beginning after December 31, 2013, and for the first taxable year  beginning after December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of this section apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Automatic stock insurance company status. The organization is  not taxable as a stock insurance company by reason of section 833(a)(1),  but may be taxable as an insurance company if it otherwise meets the  requirements of section 831(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Special deduction. The organization is not allowed the special  deduction set forth in section 833(b); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Premiums earned. The organization must take into account 80  percent, rather than 100 percent, of its unearned premiums under section  832(b)(4) as it applies to other non-life insurance companies, provided  the organization qualifies as an insurance company by meeting the  requirements of section 831(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2013.  [T.D. 9651, 79 FR 757, Jan. 7, 2014]</p>
