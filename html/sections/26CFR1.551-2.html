                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2))</em> existed  with respect to the company. Such United States shareholders,  accordingly, are determined by the stock holdings as of such specified  time. This rule applies to every United States shareholder who was a  shareholder in the company at the specified time regardless of whether  the United States shareholder is included within the United States  group. For example, a domestic corporation which is a United States  shareholder at the specified time must return its distributive share in  the undistributed foreign personal holding company income even though  the domestic corporation cannot be included within the United States  group since, under section 554, the stock it owns in the foreign  corporation is considered as being owned proportionately by its  shareholders for the purpose of determining whether the foreign  corporation is a foreign personal holding company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The United States shareholders must include in their gross  income their distributive shares of that proportion of the undistributed  foreign personal holding company income for the taxable year of the  company which is equal in ratio to that which the portion of the taxable  year up to and including the last day on which the United States group  with respect to the company existed bears to the entire taxable year.  Thus, if the last day in the taxable year on which the required United  States group existed was also the end of the taxable year, the portion  of the taxable year up to and incding such last day would be equal to  100 percent and, in such case, the United States shareholders would be  required to return their distributive shares in the entire undistributed  foreign personal holding company income. But if the last day on which  the required United States group existed was September 30, and the  taxable year was a calendar year, the portion of the taxable year up to  and including such last day would be equal to nine-twelfths and, in that  case, the United States shareholders would be required to return their  distributive shares in only   nine-twelfths of the undistributed foreign personal holding company  income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The amount which each United States shareholder must return is  that amount which he would have received as a dividend if the above- specified portion of the undistributed foreign personal holding company  income had in fact been distributed by the foreign personal holding  company as a dividend on the last day of its taxable year on which the  required United States group existed. Such amount is determined,  therefore, by the interest of the United States shareholder in the  foreign personal holding company, that is, by the number of shares of  stock owned by the United States shareholder and the relative rights of  his class of stock, if there are several classes of stock outstanding.  Thus, if a foreign personal holding company has both common and  preferred stock outstanding and the preferred shareholders are entitled  to a specified dividend before any distribution may be made to the  common shareholders, then the assumed distribution of the stated portion  of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income must first  be treated as a payment of the specified dividend on the preferred stock  before any part may be allocated as a dividend on the common stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The assumed distribution of the required portion of the  undistributed foreign personal holding company income must be returned  as dividend income by the United States shareholders for their  respective taxable years in which or with which the taxable year of the  foreign personal holding company ends. For example, if the M  Corporation, whose taxable year is the calendar year, is a foreign  personal holding company for 1954 and if A, one of its United States  shareholders, makes returns on a calendar year basis, while B, another  United States shareholder, makes returns on the basis of a fiscal year  ending November 30, A must return his assumed dividend as income for the  taxable year 1954 and B must return his distributive share as income for  the fiscal year ending November 30, 1955. In applying this rule, the  date as of which the United States group last existed with respect to  the company is immaterial. Thus, in the foregoing example, if September  30, 1954, was the last day on which the United States group with respect  to the M Corporation existed, B would still be required to return his  assumed dividend as income for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1955,  even though September 30, 1954, the date as of which the distribution is  assumed to have been made, does not fall within such fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For the treatment of gain on the sale of certain stock, see  section 306(f) and paragraph (h) of Sec. 1.306-3.</p>
