The prohibitions  of paragraph (a) of this section relating to the threatened Southern DPS  listed in Sec.  223.102 do not apply to ongoing or future state- sponsored scientific research or monitoring activities that are part of  a NMFS-approved, ESA-compliant state 4(d) research program conducted by,  or in coordination with, state fishery management agencies (California  Department of Fish and Game, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife,  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, or Alaska Department of Fish  and Game), or as part of a monitoring and research program overseen by,  or coordinated by, one of these agencies.

If approved, the state 4(d)  program authorization will cover one calendar year and state-supported  researchers would have to renew authorizations annually during  subsequent application periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Descriptions of ongoing and future state-supported research  activities must include the following information and should be  submitted to NMFS by the State: an estimate of total direct or  incidental take; a description of the study design and methodology; a  justification for take and the techniques employed; and a point of  contact.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> NMFS will provide written approval of a state 4(d) research  program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The State agency will provide an annual report to NMFS that, at  a minimum, summarizes the number of Southern DPS green sturgeon taken  directly or incidentally, and summarizes the results of the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fisheries exemptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this  section relating to the threatened Southern DPS listed in Sec.  223.102  do not apply to fisheries activities that are conducted in accordance  with a NMFS-approved Fishery Management and Evaluation Plan (FMEP). If  NMFS finds that an FMEP meets the criteria listed below, a letter of  concurrence which sets forth the terms of the FMEP's implementation and  the duties of the parties pursuant to the FMEP, will be issued to the  applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An FMEP must prohibit retention of green sturgeon (i.e., zero  bag limit); set maximum incidental take levels, include restrictions to  minimize incidental take of the green sturgeon (e.g., temporal/spatial  restrictions, size of fish, gear used); provide a biologically based  rationale demonstrating that the incidental take management strategy  will not significantly reduce the likelihood of survival or recovery of  the Southern DPS; include effective monitoring and evaluation plans;  provide for evaluating monitoring data and making revisions to the FMEP;  provide for effective enforcement and education; provide a timeframe for  FMEP implementation; and report the amount of incidental take and  summarize the effectiveness of the FMEP to NMFS on a biannual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The ESA section 9(a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) take prohibitions will  not apply to ongoing commercial and recreational fisheries activities  until September 30, 2010 if a letter of intent to develop an FMEP that  is protective of green sturgeon has been received by NMFS by July 2,  2010. The exemption will expire if the letter of intent is rejected  without further review of a FMEP. If the letter of intent is received by  August 31, 2010, a draft FMEP must be received by NMFS within 6 months  from the date of receipt of the letter of intent. A final FMEP must be  received by NMFS within 3 months from the date of receipt of NMFS'  comments on the draft FMEP. Ongoing commercial and recreational  fisheries activities may continue until NMFS issues a letter of  concurrence or denial for final FMEPs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> NMFS will provide a public comment period (=30  days) before approval of new or amended FMEPs; provide a letter of  concurrence for approved FMEPs that specifies the implementation and  reporting requirements; evaluate FMEPs every 5 years and identify  changes that would improve their effectiveness; and provide a public  comment period (=30 days) before withdrawing approval of an  FMEP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tribal exemptions. The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this  section relating to the threatened Southern DPS listed in Sec.  223.102  do not apply to fishery harvest or other activities undertaken by a  tribe, tribal member, tribal permittee, tribal employee, or tribal agent  in Willapa Bay, WA, Grays Harbor, WA, Coos Bay, OR, Winchester Bay, OR,  Humboldt Bay, CA, and any other area where tribal treaty fishing occurs,  if those activities are compliant with a tribal resource management plan  (Tribal Plan), provided that the Secretary determines that  implementation of such Tribal Plan will not appreciably reduce the  likelihood of survival   and recovery of the Southern DPS. In making that determination the  Secretary shall use the best available biological data (including any  tribal data and analysis) to determine the Tribal Plan's impact on the  biological requirements of the species, and will assess the effect of  the Tribal Plan on survival and recovery, consistent with legally  enforceable tribal rights and with the Secretary's trust  responsibilities to tribes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Tribal Plan may include, but is not limited to, plans that  address fishery harvest, artificial production, research, or water or  land management, and may be developed by one tribe or jointly with other  tribes. The Secretary will consult on a government-to-government basis  with any tribe that so requests and will provide, to the maximum extent  practicable, technical assistance in examining impacts on the Southern  DPS as tribes develop Tribal Plans. A Tribal Plan must specify the  procedures by which the tribe will enforce its provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where there exists a Federal court proceeding with continuing  jurisdiction over the subject matter of a Tribal Plan, the plan may be  developed and implemented within the ongoing Federal Court proceeding.  In such circumstances, compliance with the Tribal Plan's terms shall be  determined within that Federal Court proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Secretary shall seek comment from the public on the  Secretary's pending determination whether implementation of a Tribal  Plan will appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of  the listed Southern DPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The Secretary shall publish notification in the Federal  Register of any determination regarding a Tribal Plan and the basis for  that determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> ESA section 10 permits. The exceptions of section 10 of the ESA  (16 U.S.C. 1539) and other exceptions under the ESA relating to  endangered species, including regulations in part 222 of this chapter II  implementing such exceptions, also apply to the threatened Southern DPS  listed in Sec.  223.102. Federal, state, and private-sponsored research  activities for scientific research or enhancement purposes that are not  covered under Scientific Research and Monitoring Exceptions as described  in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or Scientific Research and  Monitoring Exemptions as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,  may take Southern DPS fish pursuant to the specifications of an ESA  section 10 permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Affirmative defense. In connection with any action alleging a  violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section with  respect to the threatened Southern DPS listed in Sec.  223.102, any  person claiming that his or her take is excepted via methods listed in  paragraph (b) of this section shall have a defense where the person can  demonstrate that the exception is applicable and was in force, and that  the person fully complied with the exception's requirements at the time  of the alleged violation. This defense is an affirmative defense that  must be raised, pleaded, and proven by the proponent. If proven, this  defense will be an absolute defense to liability under section  9(a)(1)(G) of the ESA with respect to the alleged violation.
