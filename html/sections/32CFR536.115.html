                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> SOFA provisions that call for the receiving State to adjudicate  claims have been held to be the exclusive remedy for claims against the  United States, Aaskov v. Aldridge, 695 F. Supp. 595 (D.D.C. 1988); Dancy  v. Department of the Army, 897 F. Supp. 612 (D.D.C. 1995).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SOFA provisions that call for the receiving State to adjudicate  claims against the United States usually refer to claims by third  parties brought against members of the force or civilian component. This  includes claims by tourists or business travelers as well as inhabitants  of foreign countries. Depending on how the receiving State interprets  the particular SOFA's class of proper claimants, the receiving State may  also consider claims by U.S. soldiers, civilian employees, and their  family members. Chiefs of command claims services or other Army JA  offices responsible for claims that arise in countries bound by SOFA or  other treaty provisions requiring a receiving State to consider claims  against the United States will ensure that all claims personnel know the  receiving State's policy on which persons or classes of persons are  proper claimants under such provisions. When a claim is filed both with  the receiving State and under either the Military Claims Act (MCA) or  Foreign Claims Act (FCA), the provisions of Sec. 536.76(h) of this part  and DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 3-4a apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When SOFA provisions provide for receiving state claims  consideration, the time limit for filing such claims may be much shorter  than the two years otherwise allowed under the FCA or MCA. For example,  receiving state claims offices in Germany require that a claim be filed  under the SOFA within three months of the date that the claimant is  aware of the U.S. involvement. If the filing period is about to expire  for claims arising in Germany, have the claimant fill out a claim form,  make two copies, and date-stamp each copy as received by the a sending  State claims office. Return the date-stamped original of the claim to  the claimant with instructions to promptly file with the receiving State  claims office. Keep one date-stamped copy as a potential claim. Forward  one date-stamped copy of the claim to the U.S. Army Claims Service  Europe (USACSEUR). This may toll the applicable German statute of  limitations. Additionally, many receiving state claims offices do not  require claimants to demand a sum certain. All claims personnel must  familiarize themselves with the applicable receiving state law and  procedures governing SOFA claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All foreign inhabitants who file claims against the United  States that fall within the receiving State's responsibility, such as  claims based on acts or omissions within the scope of U.S. Armed Forces  members' or civilian employees' duties, must file the claim with the  appropriate receiving State office. Those U.S. inhabitants whose claims  would be otherwise cognizable under the Military Claims Act (subpart C  of this part) and whom the receiving State deems proper claimants under  the SOFA must also file with the receiving State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A claim filed with, and considered by, a receiving State under a  SOFA or other international agreement claims provision may be considered  under other subparts of this part only if the receiving State denied the  claim on the basis that it was not cognizable under the treaty or  agreement provisions. See DA Pam 27-162, paragraph 3-4a(2), for  conditions of waiver of the foregoing requirement. See also Sec. Sec.  536.76(h) and 536.138(j) of this part. When a claimant has filed a claim  with a receiving State and received payment, or the claim has been  denied on the merits, such action will be the claimant's final and  exclusive remedy and will bar any further claims against the United  States.</p>
