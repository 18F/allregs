(1) If the Director receives from a licensee or permittee the names and appropriate identifying information of responsible persons and employees who will be authorized by the employer to possess explosive materials in the course of employment with the employer, the Director will conduct a background check in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Director receives from a licensee or permittee the names and appropriate identifying information of responsible persons and employees who will be authorized by the employer to possess explosive materials in the course of employment with the employer, the Director will conduct a background check in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director will determine whether the responsible person or employee is one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26). In making such determination, the Director may take into account a letter or document issued under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> If the Director determines that the responsible person or the employee is not one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26), the Director will notify the employer in writing or electronically of the determination and issue, to the responsible person or employee, as the case may be, a letter of clearance which confirms the determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Director determines that the responsible person or the employee is not one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26), the Director will notify the employer in writing or electronically of the determination and issue, to the responsible person or employee, as the case may be, a letter of clearance which confirms the determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Director determines that the responsible person or employee is one of the persons described in any paragraph of section 842(i) of the Act (see Sec. 555.26), ATF will notify the employer in writing or electronically of the determination and issue to the responsible person or the employee, as the case may be, a document that confirms the determination; explains the grounds for the determination; provides information on how the disability may be relieved; and explains how the determination may be appealed. The employer will retain the notification as part of his permanent records in accordance with Sec. 555.121. The employer will take immediate steps to remove the responsible person from his position directing the management or policies of the business or operations as they relate to explosive materials or, as the case may be, to remove the employee from a position requiring the possession of explosive materials. Also,

if the employer has listed the employee as a person authorized to accept delivery of explosive materials, as specified in Sec. 555.103 or Sec. 555.105, the employer must remove the employee from such list and immediately, and in no event later than the second business day after such change, notify distributors of such change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeals and correction of erroneous system information--(1) In general. A responsible person or employee may challenge the adverse determination set out in the letter of denial, in writing and within 45 days of issuance of the determination, by directing his or her challenge to the basis for the adverse determination, or to the accuracy of the record upon which the adverse determination is based, to the Director. The appeal request must include appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge. Any record or document of a court or other government entity or official furnished in support of an appeal must be certified by the court or other government entity or official as a true copy. In the case of an employee, or responsible person who did not submit fingerprints, such appeal must be accompanied by two properly completed FBI Forms FD-258 (fingerprint card). The Director will advise the individual in writing of his decision and the reasons for the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The letter of denial, among other things, will advise an employee who elects to challenge an adverse determination to submit the fingerprint cards as described above. The employee also will be advised of the agency name and address that originated the record containing the information causing the adverse determination (``originating agency''). At that time, and where appropriate, an employee is encouraged to apply to the originating agency to challenge the accuracy of the record(s) upon which the denial is based. The originating agency may respond to the individual's application by addressing the individual's specific reasons for the challenge, and by indicating whether additional information or documents are required. If the record is corrected as a result of the application to the originating agency, the individual may so notify ATF which will, in turn, verify the record correction with the originating agency and take all necessary steps to contact the agency responsible for the record system and correct the record. The employee may provide to ATF additional and appropriate documentation or record(s) establishing the legal and/or factual basis for the challenge to ATF's decision to uphold the initial denial. If ATF does not receive such additional documentation or record(s) within 45 days of the date of the decision upholding the initial denial, ATF will close the appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Responsible persons. The letter of denial, among other things, will advise a responsible person of the agency name and address which originated the record containing the information causing the adverse determination (``originating agency'').

A responsible person may provide additional documentation or records as specified for employees in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
