Bridges of the folding, pontoon and  similar type single opening drawbridges are included in this class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Draw span lights. Each draw span of every single opening  drawbridge shall be lighted with two lanterns so that when viewed from  an approaching vessel the draw span when closed will display two red  lights, one at each end of the span and when open to navigation will  display two green lights, one at each end of the span. Each lantern  shall show alternate red and green horizontal arcs of 60[deg] each, the  axis of adjacent arcs to be located 90[deg] from each other; each  lantern shall be securely mounted 15 feet above the roadway with the  axis of the green arcs parallel to the long axis of the swing span.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pier or abutment lights. Every swing bridge shall be lighted so  that   the end of each pier, abutment or fixed portion of the bridge adjacent  to the navigable channel through the draw, or each end of the protection  piers for such piers, abutments, or fixed portion of the bridge will be  marked by a red light. Each red light shall show through an arc of  180[deg], and shall be securely mounted on the pier, abutment or fixed  portion of the bridge as low as practicable to show 90[deg] on either  side of a line parallel to the axis of the channel so as to be visible  from an approaching vessel.</p>
