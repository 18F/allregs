For the CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems used to provide data under this subpart, the continuous monitoring system installation requirements for these exhaust configurations are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Single unit-single stack configurations. For an affected unit that exhausts to the atmosphere through a

single, dedicated stack, you shall either install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the stack or at a location in the ductwork downstream of all emissions control devices, where the pollutant and diluents concentrations are representative of the emissions that exit to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unit utilizing common stack with other affected unit(s). When an affected unit utilizes a common stack with one or more other affected units, but no non-affected units, you shall either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the duct leading to the common stack from each unit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the common stack.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unit(s) utilizing common stack with non-affected unit(s).

If the exhaust configuration of an affected unit consists of a main stack and a bypass stack, you shall install CEMS on both the main stack and the bypass stack, or, if it is not feasible to certify and quality-assure the data from a monitoring system on the bypass stack, you shall install a CEMS only on the main stack and count bypass hours of deviation from the monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unit with a common control device with multiple stack or duct configuration. If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is configured such that emissions are controlled with a common control device or series of control devices, are discharged to the atmosphere through more than one stack or are fed into a single stack through two or more ducts, you may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in each of the multiple stacks;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in each of the ducts that feed into the stack;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in one of the multiple stacks or ducts and monitor the flows and dilution rates in all multiple stacks or ducts in order to determine total exhaust gas flow rate and pollutant mass emissions rate in accordance with the applicable limit; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of multiple ducts feeding into a single stack, install CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the single stack as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Unit with multiple parallel control devices with multiple stacks. If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is configured such that emissions are controlled with multiple parallel control devices or multiple series of control devices are discharged to the atmosphere through more than one stack, you shall install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems described in each of the multiple stacks.

Each 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rate is the average of all of the valid SO2 emission rates in the preceding 30 boiler operating days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use only unadjusted, quality-assured SO2 concentration values in the emissions calculations; do not apply bias adjustment factors to the part 75 SO2 data and do not use part 75 substitute data values. For startup or shutdown hours (as defined in Sec. 63.10042) the default electrical load and the diluent cap are available for use in the hourly SO2 emission rate calculations, as described in Sec. 63.10007(f). Use a flag to identify each startup or shutdown hour and report a special code if the diluent cap or default electrical load is used to calculate the SO2 emission rate for any of these hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you use a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system, you must install, certify, operate, maintain and

quality-assure the data from the monitoring system in accordance with appendix A to this subpart.
