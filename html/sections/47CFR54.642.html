                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Competitive bidding requirement. All applicants are required to engage in a competitive bidding process for supported services, facilities, or equipment consistent with the requirements set forth in this subpart, unless they qualify for one or more of the exemptions in paragraph (h) of this section. In addition, applicants may engage in competitive bidding even if they qualify for an exemption. Applicants who utilize a competitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing a funding request as described in Sec. 54.643.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fair and open process. (1) All entities participating in the Healthcare Connect Fund must conduct a fair and open competitive bidding process, consistent with all applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vendors who intend to bid to provide supported services, equipment, or facilities to a health care provider may not simultaneously help the health care provider choose a winning bid. Any vendor who submits a bid, and any individual or entity that has a financial interest in such a vendor, is prohibited from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preparing, signing or submitting an applicant's request for services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Serving as the Consortium Leader or other point of contact on behalf of applicant(s);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Being involved in setting bid evaluation criteria; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Participating in the bid evaluation or vendor selection process (except in their role as potential vendors).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All potential bidders must have access to the same information and must be treated in the same manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All applicants and vendors must comply with any applicable state, Tribal, or local competitive bidding requirements.

For purposes of the Healthcare Connect Fund, ``cost-effective'' is defined as the method that costs the least after consideration of the features, quality of transmission, reliability, and other factors that the health care provider deems relevant to choosing a method of providing the required health care services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Bid evaluation criteria. Applicants must develop weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., scoring matrix) that demonstrate how the applicant will choose the most ``cost-effective'' bid before submitting a Request for Services. Price must be a primary factor, but need not be the only primary factor. A non-price factor can receive an equal weight to price, but may not receive a greater weight than price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Request for services. Applicants must submit the following documents to the Administrator in order to initiate competitive bidding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form 461, including certifications.

Requirements for bid evaluation criteria are described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Declaration of assistance. All applicants must submit a ``Declaration of Assistance'' with their Request for Services. In the Declaration of Assistance, applicants must identify each and every consultant, vendor, and other outside expert, whether paid or unpaid, who aided in the preparation of their applications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Request for proposal (if applicable). (i) Any applicant may use a request for proposals (RFP). Applicants who use an RFP must submit the RFP and any additional relevant bidding information to the Administrator with Form 461.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An applicant must submit an RFP:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If it is required to issue an RFP under applicable State, Tribal, or local procurement rules or regulations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the applicant is a consortium seeking more than $100,000 in program support during the funding year, including applications that seek more than $100,000 in program support for a multi-year commitment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the applicant is a consortium seeking support for participant-constructed and owned network facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> RFP requirements.

The applicant shall wait at least 28 days from the date on which its competitive bidding documents are posted on the Web site before selecting and committing to a vendor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Selection of the most ``cost-effective'' bid and contract negotiation. Each applicant subject to competitive bidding is required to certify to the Administrator that the selected bid is, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, the most cost-effective option available. Applicants are required to submit the documentation listed in Sec. 54.643 to support their certifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicants who plan to request evergreen status under Sec. 54.642(h)(4)(ii) must enter into a contract that identifies both parties, is signed and dated by the health care provider or Consortium Leader after the 28-day waiting period expires, and specifies the type, term, and cost of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Exemptions to competitive bidding requirements. (1) Annual undiscounted cost of $10,000 or less. An applicant that seeks support for $10,000 or less of total undiscounted eligible expenses for a single year is exempt from the competitive bidding requirements under this section, if the term of the contract is one year or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Government Master Service Agreement (MSA). Eligible health care providers that seek support for services and equipment purchased from MSAs negotiated by federal, state, Tribal, or local government entities on behalf of such health care providers and others, if such MSAs were awarded pursuant to applicable federal, state, Tribal, or local competitive bidding requirements, are exempt from the competitive bidding requirements under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Master Service Agreements approved under the Pilot Program or Healthcare Connect Fund. A eligible health care provider site may opt into an existing MSA approved under the Pilot Program or Healthcare Connect Fund and seek support for services and equipment purchased from the MSA without triggering the competitive bidding requirements under this section, if the MSA was developed and negotiated in response to an RFP that specifically solicited proposals that included a mechanism for adding additional sites to the MSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Evergreen contracts. (i) Subject to the provisions in Sec. 54.644, the Administrator may designate a multi-year contract as ``evergreen,'' which means that the service(s) covered by the contract need not be re-bid during the contract term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A contract entered into by a health care provider or consortium as a result of competitive bidding may be designated as evergreen if it meets all of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is signed by the individual health care provider or consortium lead entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Specifies the service type, bandwidth and quantity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Specifies the term of the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Specifies the cost of services to be provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Includes the physical location or other identifying information of the health care provider sites purchasing from the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Participants may exercise voluntary options to extend an evergreen contract without undergoing additional competitive bidding, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The voluntary extension(s) is memorialized in the evergreen contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The decision to extend the contract occurs before the participant files its funding request for the funding year when the contract would otherwise expire; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The voluntary extension(s) do not exceed five years in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Schools and libraries program master contracts.
