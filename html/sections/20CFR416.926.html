Your impairment(s) is medically equivalent to a listed impairment in appendix 1 of subpart P of part 404 of this chapter if it is at least equal in severity and duration to the criteria of any listed impairment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> How do we determine medical equivalence?

When we determine if your impairment medically equals a listing, we consider all evidence in your case record about your impairment(s) and its effects on you that is relevant to this finding. We do not consider your vocational factors of age, education, and work experience (see, for example, Sec. 416.960(c)(1)). We also consider the opinion given by one or more medical or psychological consultants designated by the Commissioner. (See Sec. 416.1016.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Who is a designated medical or psychological consultant? A medical or psychological consultant designated by the Commissioner includes any medical or psychological consultant employed or engaged to make medical judgments by the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, or a State agency authorized to make disability determinations. A medical consultant must be an acceptable medical source identified in Sec. 416.913(a)(1) or (a)(3) through (a)(5). A psychological consultant used in cases where there is evidence of a mental impairment must be a qualified psychologist. (See Sec. 416.1016 for limitations on

what medical consultants who are not physicians can evaluate and the qualifications we consider necessary for a psychologist to be a consultant.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Who is responsible for determining medical equivalence? In cases where the State agency or other designee of the Commissioner makes the initial or reconsideration disability determination, a State agency medical or psychological consultant or other designee of the Commissioner (see Sec. 416.1016 of this part) has the overall responsibility for determining medical equivalence. For cases in the disability hearing process or otherwise decided by a disability hearing officer, the responsibility for determining medical equivalence rests with either the disability hearing officer or, if the disability hearing officer's reconsideration determination is changed under Sec. 416.1418 of this part, with the Associate Commissioner for Disability Programs or his or her delegate. For cases at the administrative law judge or Appeals Council level, the responsibility for deciding medical equivalence rests with the administrative law judge or Appeals Council.

Sec. 416.926a  Functional equivalence for children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. If you have a severe impairment or combination of impairments that does not meet or medically equal any listing, we will decide whether it results in limitations that functionally equal the listings. By ``functionally equal the listings,'' we mean that your impairment(s) must be of listing-level severity; i.e., it must result in ``marked'' limitations in two domains of functioning or an ``extreme'' limitation in one domain, as explained in this section. We will assess the functional limitations caused by your impairment(s); i.e., what you cannot do, have difficulty doing, need help doing, or are restricted from doing because of your impairment(s). When we make a finding regarding functional equivalence, we will assess the interactive and cumulative effects of all of the impairments for which we have evidence, including any impairments you have that are not ``severe.'' (See Sec. 416.924(c).) When we assess your functional limitations, we will consider all the relevant factors in Secs. 416.924a, 416.924b, and 416.929 including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> How well you can initiate and sustain activities, how much extra help you need, and the effects of structured or supportive settings (see Sec. 416.924a(b)(5));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> How you function in school (see Sec. 416.924a(b)(7)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The effects of your medications or other treatment (see Sec. 416.924a(b)(9)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> How we will consider your functioning. We will look at the information we have in your case record about how your functioning is affected during all of your activities when we decide whether your impairment or combination of impairments functionally equals the listings. Your activities are everything you do at home, at school, and in your community. We will look at how appropriately, effectively, and independently you perform your activities compared to the performance of other children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We will consider how you function in your activities in terms of six domains. These domains are broad areas of functioning intended to capture all of what a child can or cannot do. In paragraphs (g) through (l), we describe each domain in general terms. For most of the domains, we also provide examples of activities that illustrate the typical functioning of children in different age groups. For all of the domains, we also provide examples of limitations within the domains. However, we recognize that there is a range of development and functioning, and that not all children within an age category are expected to be able to do all of the activities in the examples of typical functioning. We also recognize that limitations of any of the activities in the examples do not necessarily mean that a child has a ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitation, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. The domains we use are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Acquiring and using information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Attending and completing tasks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interacting and relating with others;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Moving about and manipulating objects;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Caring for yourself; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Health and physical well-being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When we evaluate your ability to function in each domain, we will ask for and consider information that will help us answer the following questions about whether your impairment(s) affects your functioning and whether your activities are typical of other children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> What activities are you able to perform?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> What activities are you not able to perform?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Which of your activities are limited or restricted compared to other children your age who do not have impairments?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Where do you have difficulty with your activities-at home, in childcare, at school, or in the community?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Do you have difficulty independently initiating, sustaining, or completing activities?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> What kind of help do you need to do your activities, how much help do you need, and how often do you need it?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> We will try to get information from sources who can tell us about the effects of your impairment(s) and how you function. We will ask for information from your treating and other medical sources who have seen you and can give us their medical findings and opinions about your limitations and restrictions. We will also ask for information from your parents and teachers, and may ask for information from others who see you often and can describe your functioning at home, in childcare, at school, and in your community. We may also ask you to go to a consultative examination(s) at our expense. (See Secs. 416.912-416.919a regarding medical evidence and when we will purchase a consultative examination.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The interactive and cumulative effects of an impairment or multiple impairments. When we evaluate your functioning and decide which domains may be affected by your impairment(s), we will look first at your activities and your limitations and restrictions. Any given activity may involve the integrated use of many abilities and skills; therefore, any single limitation may be the result of the interactive and cumulative effects of one or more impairments. And any given impairment may have effects in more than one domain; therefore, we will evaluate the limitations from your impairment(s) in any affected domain(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> How we will decide that your impairment(s) functionally equals the listings. We will decide that your impairment(s) functionally equals the listings if it is of listing-level severity. Your impairment(s) is of listing-level severity if you have ``marked'' limitations in two of the domains in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or an ``extreme'' limitation in one domain. We will not compare your functioning to the requirements of any specific listing. We explain what the terms ``marked'' and ``extreme'' mean in paragraph (e) of this section. We explain how we use the domains in paragraph (f) of this section, and describe each domain in paragraphs (g)-(l). You must also meet the duration requirement. (See Sec. 416.909.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> How we define ``marked'' and ``extreme'' limitations--(1) General. (i) When we decide whether you have a ``marked'' or an ``extreme'' limitation, we will consider your functional limitations resulting from all of your impairments, including their interactive and cumulative effects. We will consider all the relevant information in your case record that helps us determine your functioning, including your signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the descriptions we have about your functioning from your parents, teachers, and other people who know you, and the relevant factors explained in Secs. 416.924a, 416.924b, and 416.929.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.

We will consider all the relevant information in your case record that helps us determine your functioning, including your signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the descriptions we have about your functioning from your parents, teachers, and other people who know you, and the relevant factors explained in Secs. 416.924a, 416.924b, and 416.929.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The medical evidence may include formal testing that provides information about your development or functioning in terms of percentiles, percentages of delay, or age or grade equivalents. Standard scores (e.g., percentiles) can be converted to standard deviations. When you have such scores, we will consider them together with the information we have about your functioning to determine whether you

have a ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitation in a domain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Marked limitation. (i) We will find that you have a ``marked'' limitation in a domain when your impairment(s) interferes seriously with your ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities. Your day-to-day functioning may be seriously limited when your impairment(s) limits only one activity or when the interactive and cumulative effects of your impairment(s) limit several activities. ``Marked'' limitation also means a limitation that is ``more than moderate'' but ``less than extreme.'' It is the equivalent of the functioning we would expect to find on standardized testing with scores that are at least two, but less than three, standard deviations below the mean.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> We will find that you have a ``marked'' limitation in a domain when your impairment(s) interferes seriously with your ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.

It is the equivalent of the functioning we would expect to find on standardized testing with scores that are at least two, but less than three, standard deviations below the mean.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If you have not attained age 3, we will generally find that you have a ``marked'' limitation if you are functioning at a level that is more than one-half but not more than two-thirds of your chronological age when there are no standard scores from standardized tests in your case record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If you are a child of any age (birth to the attainment of age 18), we will find that you have a ``marked'' limitation when you have a valid score that is two standard deviations or more below the mean, but less than three standard deviations, on a comprehensive standardized test designed to measure ability or functioning in that domain, and your day-to-day functioning in domain-related activities is consistent with that score. (See paragraph (e)(4) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For the sixth domain of functioning, ``Health and physical well-being,'' we may also consider you to have a ``marked'' limitation if you are frequently ill because of your impairment(s) or have frequent exacerbations of your impairment(s) that result in significant, documented symptoms or signs. For purposes of this domain, ``frequent means that you have episodes of illness or exacerbations that occur on an average of 3 times a year, or once every 4 months, each lasting 2 weeks or more. We may also find that you have a ``marked'' limitation if you have episodes that occur more often than 3 times in a year or once every 4 months but do not last for 2 weeks, or occur less often than an average of 3 times a year or once every 4 months but last longer than 2 weeks, if the overall effect (based on the length of the episode(s) or its frequency) is equivalent in severity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Extreme limitation. (i) We will find that you have an ``extreme'' limitation in a domain when your impairment(s) interferes very seriously with your ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities. Your day-to-day functioning may be very seriously limited when your impairment(s) limits only one activity or when the interactive and cumulative effects of your impairment(s) limit several activities. ``Extreme'' limitation also means a limitation that is ``more than marked.'' ``Extreme'' limitation is the rating we give to the worst limitations. However, ``extreme limitation'' does not necessarily mean a total lack or loss of ability to function. It is the equivalent of the functioning we would expect to find on standardized testing with scores that are at least three standard deviations below the mean.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> We will find that you have an ``extreme'' limitation in a domain when your impairment(s) interferes very seriously with your ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.

However, ``extreme limitation'' does not necessarily mean a total lack or loss of ability to function. It is the equivalent of the functioning we would expect to find on standardized testing with scores that are at least three standard deviations below the mean.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If you have not attained age 3, we will generally find that you have an ``extreme'' limitation if you are functioning at a level that is one-half of your chronological age or less when there are no standard scores from standardized tests in your case record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If you are a child of any age (birth to the attainment of age 18), we will find that you have an ``extreme'' limitation when you have a valid score that is three standard deviations or more below the mean on a comprehensive standardized test designed to measure ability or functioning in that domain, and your day-to-day functioning in domain-related activities is consistent with that score. (See paragraph (e)(4) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For the sixth domain of functioning, ``Health and physical well-being,'' we may also consider you to have an ``extreme'' limitation if you are frequently ill because of your impairment(s) or have frequent exacerbations of your impairment(s) that result in significant, documented symptoms or signs substantially in excess of the requirements for showing a ``marked'' limitation in paragraph

(e)(2)(iv) of this section. However, if you have episodes of illness or exacerbations of your impairment(s) that we would rate as ``extreme'' under this definition, your impairment(s) should meet or medically equal the requirements of a listing in most cases. See Secs. 416.925 and 416.926.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> How we will consider your test scores. (i) As indicated in Sec. 416.924a(a)(1)(ii), we will not rely on any test score alone. No single piece of information taken in isolation can establish whether you have a ``marked'' or an ``extreme'' limitation in a domain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> As indicated in Sec. 416.924a(a)(1)(ii), we will not rely on any test score alone. No single piece of information taken in isolation can establish whether you have a ``marked'' or an ``extreme'' limitation in a domain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We will consider your test scores together with the other information we have about your functioning, including reports of classroom performance and the observations of school personnel and others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> We may find that you have a ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitation when you have a test score that is slightly higher than the level provided in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, if other information in your case record shows that your functioning in day-to-day activities is seriously or very seriously limited because of your impairment(s). For example, you may have IQ scores above the level in paragraph (e)(2), but other evidence shows that your impairment(s) causes you to function in school, home, and the community far below your expected level of functioning based on this score.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On the other hand, we may find that you do not have a ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitation, even if your test scores are at the level provided in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, if other information in your case record shows that your functioning in day-to-day activities is not seriously or very seriously limited by your impairment(s). For example, you may have a valid IQ score below the level in paragraph (e)(2), but other evidence shows that you have learned to drive a car, shop independently, and read books near your expected grade level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If there is a material inconsistency between your test scores and other information in your case record, we will try to resolve it. The interpretation of the test is primarily the responsibility of the psychologist or other professional who administered the test. But it is also our responsibility to ensure that the evidence in your case is complete and consistent or that any material inconsistencies have been resolved. Therefore, we will use the following guidelines when we resolve concerns about your test scores:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> We may be able to resolve the inconsistency with the information we have. We may need to obtain additional information; e.g., by recontact with your medical source(s), by purchase of a consultative examination to provide further medical information, by recontact with a medical source who provided a consultative examination, or by questioning individuals familiar with your day-to-day functioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Generally, we will not rely on a test score as a measurement of your functioning within a domain when the information we have about your functioning is the kind of information typically used by medical professionals to determine that the test results are not the best measure of your day-to-day functioning. When we do not rely on test scores, we will explain our reasons for doing so in your case record or in our decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> How we will use the domains to help us evaluate your functioning. (1) When we consider whether you have ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitations in any domain, we examine all the information we have in your case record about how your functioning is limited because of your impairment(s), and we compare your functioning to the typical functioning of children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When we consider whether you have ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitations in any domain, we examine all the information we have in your case record about how your functioning is limited because of your impairment(s), and we compare your functioning to the typical functioning of children your age who do not have impairments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The general descriptions of each domain in paragraphs (g)-(l) help us decide whether you have limitations in any given domain and whether these limitations are ``marked'' or ``extreme.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The domain descriptions also include examples of some activities typical of children in each age group and some functional limitations that we may consider. These examples also help us decide whether you have limitations in a domain because of your impairment(s). The examples are not all-inclusive, and we will not require our adjudicators to develop evidence about each specific example. When you

have limitations in a given activity or activities in the examples, we may or may not decide that you have a ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitation in the domain. We will consider the activities in which you are limited because of your impairment(s) and the extent of your limitations under the rules in paragraph (e) of this section. We will also consider all of the relevant provisions of Secs. 416.924a, 416.924b, and 416.929.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Acquiring and using information. In this domain, we consider how well you acquire or learn information, and how well you use the information you have learned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. (i) Learning and thinking begin at birth. You learn as you explore the world through sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. As you play, you acquire concepts and learn that people, things, and activities have names. This lets you understand symbols, which prepares you to use language for learning. Using the concepts and symbols you have acquired through play and learning experiences, you should be able to learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and understand and use new information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Learning and thinking begin at birth.

Using the concepts and symbols you have acquired through play and learning experiences, you should be able to learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and understand and use new information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Thinking is the application or use of information you have learned. It involves being able to perceive relationships, reason, and make logical choices. People think in different ways. When you think in pictures, you may solve a problem by watching and imitating what another person does. When you think in words, you may solve a problem by using language to talk your way through it. You must also be able to use language to think about the world and to understand others and express yourself; e.g., to follow directions, ask for information, or explain something.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Age group descriptors--(i) Newborns and young infants (birth to attainment of age 1). At this age, you should show interest in, and explore, your environment. At first, your actions are random; for example, when you accidentally touch the mobile over your crib. Eventually, your actions should become deliberate and purposeful, as when you shake noisemaking toys like a bell or rattle. You should begin to recognize, and then anticipate, routine situations and events, as when you grin with expectation at the sight of your stroller. You should also recognize and gradually attach meaning to everyday sounds, as when you hear the telephone or your name. Eventually, you should recognize and respond to familiar words, including family names and what your favorite toys and activities are called.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Newborns and young infants (birth to attainment of age 1).

You should also recognize and gradually attach meaning to everyday sounds, as when you hear the telephone or your name. Eventually, you should recognize and respond to familiar words, including family names and what your favorite toys and activities are called.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Older infants and toddlers (age 1 to attainment of age 3). At this age, you are learning about the world around you. When you play, you should learn how objects go together in different ways. You should learn that by pretending, your actions can represent real things. This helps you understand that words represent things, and that words are simply symbols or names for toys, people, places, and activities. You should refer to yourself and things around you by pointing and eventually by naming. You should form concepts and solve simple problems through purposeful experimentation (e.g., taking toys apart), imitation, constructive play (e.g., building with blocks), and pretend play activities. You should begin to respond to increasingly complex instructions and questions, and to produce an increasing number of words and grammatically correct simple sentences and questions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Preschool children (age 3 to attainment of age 6). When you are old enough to go to preschool or kindergarten, you should begin to learn and use the skills that will help you to read and write and do arithmetic when you are older. For example, listening to stories, rhyming words, and matching letters are skills needed for learning to read. Counting, sorting shapes, and building with blocks are skills needed to learn math. Painting, coloring, copying shapes, and using scissors are some of the skills needed in learning to write. Using words to ask questions, give answers, follow directions, describe things, explain what you mean, and tell stories allows you to acquire and share knowledge and experience of the world around you. All of these are called ``readiness skills,'' and you should have them by the time you begin first grade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> School-age children (age 6 to attainment of age 12). When you are old

enough to go to elementary and middle school, you should be able to learn to read, write, and do math, and discuss history and science. You will need to use these skills in academic situations to demonstrate what you have learned; e.g., by reading about various subjects and producing oral and written projects, solving mathematical problems, taking achievement tests, doing group work, and entering into class discussions. You will also need to use these skills in daily living situations at home and in the community (e.g., reading street signs, telling time, and making change). You should be able to use increasingly complex language (vocabulary and grammar) to share information and ideas with individuals or groups, by asking questions and expressing your own ideas, and by understanding and responding to the opinions of others.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Adolescents (age 12 to attainment of age 18). In middle and high school, you should continue to demonstrate what you have learned in academic assignments (e.g., composition, classroom discussion, and laboratory experiments). You should also be able to use what you have learned in daily living situations without assistance (e.g., going to the store, using the library, and using public transportation). You should be able to comprehend and express both simple and complex ideas, using increasingly complex language (vocabulary and grammar) in learning and daily living situations (e.g., to obtain and convey information and ideas).

taking a bath). Early in this age range, it may be easy for you to agree to do what your caregiver asks. Later, that may be difficult for you because you want to do things your way or not at all. These changes usually mean that you are more confident about your ideas and what you are able to do. You should also begin to understand how to control behaviors that are not good for you (e.g., crossing the street without an adult).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> School-age children (age 6 to attainment of age 12).

You should be able to identify those circumstances when you feel good about yourself and when you feel bad. You should begin to develop understanding of what is right and wrong, and what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. You should begin to demonstrate consistent control over your behavior, and you should be able to avoid behaviors that are unsafe or otherwise not good for you. You should begin to imitate more of the behavior of adults you know.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Adolescents (age 12 to attainment of age 18).

Sometimes these worries can make you feel angry or frustrated. You should begin to discover appropriate ways to express your feelings, both good and bad (e.g., keeping a diary to sort out angry feelings or listening to music to calm yourself down).

As in any case, your limitations must result from your medically determinable impairment(s). However, we will consider all of the relevant information in your case record when we decide whether your medically determinable impairment(s) results in a ``marked'' or ``extreme'' limitation in this domain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You have generalized symptoms, such as weakness, dizziness, agitation (e.g., excitability), lethargy (e.g., fatigue or loss of energy or stamina), or psychomotor retardation because of your impairment(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You have somatic complaints related to your impairments (e.g., seizure or convulsive activity, headaches, incontinence, recurrent infections, allergies, changes in weight or eating habits, stomach discomfort, nausea, headaches, or insomnia).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You have limitations in your physical functioning because of your treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, multiple surgeries, chelation, pulmonary cleansing, or nebulizer treatments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You have exacerbations from one impairment or a combination of impairments that interfere with your physical functioning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> You are medically fragile and need intensive medical care to maintain your level of health and physical well-being.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Examples of impairments that functionally equal the listings. The following are some examples of impairments and limitations that functionally equal the listings. Findings of equivalence based on the disabling functional limitations of a child's impairment(s) are not limited to the examples in this paragraph, because these examples do not describe all possible effects of impairments that might be found to functionally equal the listings. As with any disabling impairment, the duration requirement must also be met (see Secs. 416.909 and 416.924(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Documented need for major organ transplant (e.g., liver).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any condition that is disabling at the time of onset, requiring continuing surgical management within 12 months after onset as a life-saving measure or for salvage or restoration of function, and such major function is not restored or is not expected to be restored within 12 months after onset of this condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective ambulation possible only with obligatory bilateral upper limb assistance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any physical impairment(s) or combination of physical and mental impairments causing complete inability to function independently outside the area of one's home within age-appropriate norms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Requirement for 24-hour-a-day supervision for medical (including psychological) reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Infants weighing less than 1200 grams at birth, until attainment of 1 year of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Infants weighing at least 1200 but less than 2000 grams at birth, and who

are small for gestational age, until attainment of 1 year of age. (Small for gestational age means a birth weight that is at or more than 2 standard deviations below the mean or that is below the 3rd growth percentile for the gestational age of the infant.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Major congenital organ dysfunction which could be expected to result in death within the first year of life without surgical correction, and the impairment is expected to be disabling (because of residual impairment following surgery, or the recovery time required, or both) until attainment of 1 year of age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Responsibility for determining functional equivalence. In cases where the State agency or other designee of the Commissioner makes the initial or reconsideration disability determination, a State agency medical or psychological consultant or other designee of the Commissioner (see Sec. 416.1016 of this part) has the overall responsibility for determining functional equivalence. For cases in the disability hearing process or otherwise decided by a disability hearing officer, the responsibility for determining functional equivalence rests with either the disability hearing officer or, if the disability hearing officer's reconsideration determination is changed under Sec. 416.1418 of this part, with the Associate Commissioner for Disability Programs or his or her delegate. For cases at the administrative law judge or Appeals Council level, the responsibility for deciding functional equivalence rests with the administrative law judge or Appeals Council.
