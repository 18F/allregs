When more than  one thickness of a material of the same density is to be tested, only a  sample of a single thickness need be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The range of thicknesses and densities in which it is proposed  to manufacture or use the material together with any information or  recommendations that the manufacturer may have as to maximum or minimum  thickness or density.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The location of the place or places where the material will be  manufactured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Description of attachment to or protection of the bulkhead or  deck. If an adhesive is used, a liberal sample shall be supplied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A sketch showing typical installation methods and indicating  limitations if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A general statement describing manufacturing procedures  indicating the degree of quality control exercised and the degree of  inspection performed by outside organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A statement indicating proposed methods for field  identification of the products as being approved.

The above information will be examined by the  Coast Guard, and if it is indicated that the material is in all respects  suitable for testing, the manufacturer will be so advised. Coast Guard  comments on the manufacturer's recommended thickness and density of the  sample or samples for the fire resistance test will be given at this  time, together with the estimated cost of the required test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Samples to be submitted. If the material is indicated as being  suitable for testing, the manufacturer shall submit a 100 cm. x 150 cm.  (40 x 60) sample, a 30 cm. x 30 cm. (12  x 12) sample and a 60 cm. x 60cm. (24 x  24) sample for each thickness and density proposed to the  Fire Research section of the National Bureau of Standards, Washington,  DC 20234, and shall advise the Coast Guard of the shipment. A separate  test will be made for each density of the material for which approval is  desired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pretest information. At this time the manufacturer shall submit  to the Coast Guard the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement that the material is offered for testing as  described pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section is completely  representative of the   product which will be manufactured and sold under U.S. Coast Guard  approval if such approval is granted and that the shipbuilder will be  advised of the proper installation methods and the limitations of the  approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A commitment that he will reimburse the National Bureau of  Standards for the cost or review of the tests when billed by them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the manufacturer desires to witness the test, he should so  indicate at this time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test authorization.
