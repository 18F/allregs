                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Streamlined appeal. This appeal would demonstrate that the  application of a specific Operating Fund formula component has a blatant  and objective flaw.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal of formula income for economic hardship. After a PHA's  formula income has been frozen, the PHA can appeal to have its formula  income adjusted to reflect a severe local economic hardship that is  impacting the PHA's ability to maintain rental and other revenue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeal for specific local conditions. This appeal would be based  on demonstrations that the model's predictions are not reliable because  of specific local conditions. To be eligible, the affected PHA must  demonstrate a variance of ten percent or greater in its PEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appeal for changing market conditions. A PHA may appeal to  receive operating subsidy for vacant units due to changing market  conditions, after a PHA has taken aggressive marketing and outreach  measures to rent these units. For example, a PHA could appeal if it is  located in an area experiencing population loss or economic dislocations  that faces a lack of demand for housing in the foreseeable future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeal to substitute actual project cost data. A PHA may appeal  its PEL if it can produce actual project cost data derived from actual  asset management, as outlined in subpart H of this part, for a period of  at least two years.</p>
