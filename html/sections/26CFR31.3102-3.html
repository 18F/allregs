                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Collection of tax from employee--(1) In general. Subject to the limitations set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the employer shall collect from each of his employees the employee tax on those tips received by the employee which constitute wages for purposes of the tax imposed by section 3101. (For provisions relating to the treatment of tips as wages, see 3121(a)(12) and 3121(q).) The employer shall make the collection by deducting or causing to be deducted the amount of the employee tax from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer (see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). For purposes of this section the term ``wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer'' means, with respect to a payment of wages, an amount equal to wages as defined in section 3121(a) except that tips and noncash remuneration which are wages are not included, less the sum of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general.

in respect of wages as defined in section 3401(a) (exclusive of tips); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of taxes imposed on the remuneration of an employee withheld by the employer pursuant to State and local law (including amounts withheld under an agreement between the employer and the employee pursuant to such law) except that the amount of taxes taken into account in this subdivision shall not include any amount attributable to tips.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations. An employer is required to collect employee tax on tips which constitute wages only in respect of those tips which are reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). The employer is responsible for the collection of employee tax on tips reported to him only to the extent that the employer can--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the period beginning at the time the written statement is submitted to him and ending at the close of the 10th day of the month following the month in which the statement was submitted, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of an employer who elects to deduct the tax on an estimated basis (see paragraph (c) of this section), during the period beginning at the time the written statement is submitted to him and ending at the close of the 30th day following the quarter in which the statement was submitted,
collect the employee tax by deducting it or causing it to be deducted as provided in subparagraph (1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Furnishing of funds to employer. If the amount of employee tax in respect of tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement (or statements) furnished pursuant to section 6053(a) exceeds the wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer, the employee may furnish to the employer, within the period specified in subparagraph (2) (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (whichever is applicable), an amount of money equal to the amount of such excess.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Less than $20 of tips. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if an employee furnishes to his employer a written statement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Covering a period of less than 1 month, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The statement is furnished to the employer prior to the close of the 10th day of the month following the month in which the tips were actually received by the employee, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The aggregate amount of tips reported in the statement and in all other statements previously furnished by the employee covering periods within the same month is less than $20, and the statements, collectively, do not cover the entire month,
the employer may deduct amounts equivalent to employee tax on such tips from wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer or other funds turned over by the employee to the employer. For provisions relating to the repayment to an employee, or other disposition, of amounts deducted from an employee's remuneration in excess of the correct amount of employee tax, see Sec. 31.6413(a)-1. (As to the exclusion from wages of tips of less than $20, see Sec. 31.3121(a)(12)-1.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Collection of employee tax on estimated basis--(1) In general.

Subject to certain limitations and conditions, an employer may, at his discretion, make collection of the employee tax in respect of tips reported by an employee to the employer on an estimated basis. An employer who elects to make collection of the employee tax on an estimated basis shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In respect of each employee, make an estimate of the amount of tips that will be reported, pursuant to section 6053(a), by the employee to the employer in a calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the amount which must be deducted upon each payment of wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer to be made during the quarter by the employer to the employee in order to collect from the employee during the quarter an amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the estimated quarterly tips by the sum of the rates of tax under subsections (a) and (b) of section 3101.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Deduct from any payment of such employee's wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer, or from funds referred to in

paragraph (a)(3) of this section, such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount of tax withheld on the estimated basis to conform to the amount of employee tax imposed upon, and required to be deducted in respect of, tips reported by the employee to the employer during the calendar quarter in written statements furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a). If an adjustment is required, the additional employee tax required to be collected may be deducted upon any payment of the employee's wages (exclusive of tips) which are under the control of the employer during the quarter and within the first 30 days following the quarter or from funds turned over by the employee to the employer for such purposes within such period. For provisions relating to the repayment to an employee, or other disposition, of amounts deducted from an employee's remuneration in excess of the correct amount of employee tax, see Sec. 31.6413(a)-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimating tips employee will report--(i) Initial estimate. The initial estimate of the amount of tips that will be reported by a particular employee in a calendar quarter shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the employment of that employee. However, if a number of employees are employed under substantially the same circumstances and working conditions, the initial estimate established for one such employee may be used as the initial estimate for other employees in that group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Initial estimate. The initial estimate of the amount of tips that will be reported by a particular employee in a calendar quarter shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the employment of that employee. However, if a number of employees are employed under substantially the same circumstances and working conditions, the initial estimate established for one such employee may be used as the initial estimate for other employees in that group.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjusting estimate. If the quarterly estimate of tips in respect of a particular employee continues to differ substantially from the amount of tips reported by the employee and there are no unusual factors involved (for example, an extended absence from work due to illness) the employer shall make an appropriate adjustment of his estimate of the amount of tips that will be reported by the employee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonableness of estimate. The employer must be prepared, upon request of the district director, to disclose the factors upon which he relied in making the estimate, and his reasons for believing that the estimate is reasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee tax not collected by employer.

the employee shall be liable for the payment of tax in an amount equal to such excess. For provisions relating to the manner and time of payment of employee tax by an employee, see paragraph (d) of Sec. 31.6011(a)-1 and paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 31.6071(a)-1. For provisions relating to statements required to be furnished by employers to employees in respect of uncollected employee tax on tips reported to the employer, see Sec. 31.6053-2.
