When taking such actions, the Responsible Official  shall take into account the probable environmental consequences of these  actions and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the  extent practical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Responsible Official shall document in writing the  determination that an emergency exists and describe the responsive  action(s) taken at the time the emergency exists. The form of that  documentation is within the discretion of the Responsible Official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Responsible Official determines that proposed actions  taken in response to an emergency, beyond actions noted in paragraph (a)  of this section, are not likely to have significant environmental  impacts, the Responsible Official shall document that determination in  an environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact  prepared in accordance with this part, unless categorically excluded  (see subpart C of this part). If the Responsible Official finds that the  nature and scope of the subsequent actions related to the emergency  require taking such proposed actions prior to completing an  environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact, the  Responsible Official shall consult with the Office of Environmental  Policy and Compliance about alternative arrangements for NEPA  compliance. The Assistant Secretary, Policy Management and Budget or  his/her designee may grant an alternative arrangement. Any alternative  arrangement must be documented. Consultation with the Department must be  coordinated through the appropriate bureau headquarters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department shall consult with CEQ about alternative  arrangements as soon as possible if the Responsible Official determines  that proposed actions, taken in response to an emergency, beyond actions  noted in paragraph (a) of this section, are likely to have significant  environmental impacts. The Responsible Official shall consult with  appropriate bureau headquarters and the Department, about alternative  arrangements as soon as the Responsible Official determines that the  proposed action is likely to have a significant environmental effect.  Such alternative arrangements will apply only to the proposed actions  necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other  proposed actions remain subject to NEPA analysis and documentation in  accordance with this part.</p>
