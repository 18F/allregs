                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subchapter 18 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled,  ``Control and Prohibitions of Air Pollution from Ambient Air Quality in  Nonattainment Areas (Emission Offset Rule),'' N.J.A.C. 7:27-18.1 et  seq., as submitted to EPA on August 5, 1980 by the New Jersey Department  of Environmental Protection, is approved for the entire State of New  Jersey, with the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The definition of ``significant emission increase'' as it  appears in section 7:27-18.1, entitled, ``Definitions,'' is disapproved.  The following definition of ``significant emission increase'' is  applicable: ``An increase, since December 21, 1976, in the rate of  allowable emissions, including fugitive pollutant emissions, at a  facility of any criteria pollutant greater than or equal to 50 tons per  year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour, not including  decreases in the rates of allowable emissions except where such  decreases are contemporaneous with emission increases. The increase in  the rates of allowable emissions shall be the cumulative total of  increases from all new or altered equipment for which permits have been  issued on or after December 21, 1976 and for which permit applications  have been received by the Department, and the fugitive emissions  associated with that equipment. The hourly and daily rates shall apply  only with respect to a pollutant for which a national ambient air  quality standard for a period not exceeding 24 hours has been  established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsection (e)(1) under section 7:27-18.2, entitled, ``General  Provisions,'' is disapproved and replaced with the following: ``The  requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section  shall again become applicable when proposed new construction or  alterations at the facility would   cause the increase in the rate of allowable emissions of that criteria  pollutant to again exceed 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100  pounds per hour whichever is most restrictive. The accumulation of  increases in the rate of allowable emissions shall resume from zero  after each application of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this  section.''
