                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any recipient that expends $500,000 or more in a year under  Federal awards must have an audit made for that year by an independent  auditor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If a  recipient is currently performing under a Federal award that requires an  audit by its Federal cognizant agency, that auditor must perform the  independent audit. The audit generally should be made a part of the  regularly scheduled, annual audit of the recipient's financial  statements. However, it may be more economical in some cases to have  Federal awards separately audited, and a recipient may elect to do so,  unless that option is precluded by award terms and conditions or by  Federal laws or regulations applicable to the program(s) under which the  awards were made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The auditor must determine and report on whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The recipient has an internal control structure that provides  reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal awards in compliance  with Federal laws and regulations and the terms and conditions of the  awards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Based on a sampling of Federal award expenditures, the recipient  has complied with laws, regulations, and award terms that may have a  direct and material effect on Federal awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The recipient must make the auditor's report available to the  DOE contracting officers whose awards are affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Before requesting an audit in addition to the independent audit,  the contracting officer must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consider whether the independent audit satisfies his or her  requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limit the scope of such additional audit to areas not adequately  addressed by the independent audit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If DOE is not the Federal agency with the predominant fiscal  interest in the recipient, coordinate with the agency that has the  predominant fiscal interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The recipient and its Federal cognizant agency for audit should  develop a coordinated audit approach to minimize duplication of audit  work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Audit costs (including a reasonable allocation of the costs of  the audit of the recipient's financial statement, based on the relative  benefit to the Government and the recipient) are allowable costs of DOE  awards.</p>
