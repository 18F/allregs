                            <p class="depth0">The Federal Property Act provides that real property and related personal property with an aggregate total cost of $1,000,000 or more (or personal property with an acquisition cost of $3,000,000 or more) or patents, processes, techniques, or inventions, regardless of cost, shall not be disposed of to any private interest until the advice of the Attorney General has been received as to whether the proposed disposal would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the anti-trust laws. Prior to obligating the Government on any such disposal, Division Engineers will furnish DAEN-REM information on the probable terms and conditions of the sale. DAEN-REM will use the information as the basis for a request to the Attorney General for advice. Under the provision cited, the Attorney General is allowed up to 60 days to furnish the advice requested. The Federal Property Management Regulation, Sec. 101-47.301.2 provides guidance on the information to be furnished. Where indentical bids in excess of the $2,500 are received, FPMR 101-47.304-8 provides for a report to the Department of Justice. Section 101-47.304-8 provides guidance for such reports to be addressed to the Attorney General, WASH, DC, 20530.</p>
