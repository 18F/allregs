                            <p class="depth0">The technical guidelines in this subpart set forth qualifying, favorable, potentially adverse, and, in five guidelines, disqualifying conditions on the characteristics, processes, and events that may influence the performance of a repository system after closure. The favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions under each guideline are not listed in any assumed order of importance. Potentially adverse conditions will be considered if they affect waste isolation within the controlled area even though such conditions may occur outside the controlled area. The technical guidelines that follow establish conditions that shall be considered in determining compliance with the qualifying condition of the postclosure system guideline. For each technical guideline, an evaluation of qualification or disqualification shall be made in accordance with the requirements specified in subpart B.</p>
