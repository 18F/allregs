                            <p class="depth0">The technical guidelines in this subpart set forth qualifying,  favorable, potentially adverse, and, in five guidelines, disqualifying  conditions on the characteristics, processes, and events that may  influence the performance of a repository system after closure. The  favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions under each  guideline are not listed in any assumed order of importance. Potentially  adverse conditions will be considered if they affect waste isolation  within the controlled area even though such conditions may occur outside  the controlled area. The technical guidelines that follow establish  conditions that shall be considered in determining compliance with the  qualifying condition of the postclosure system guideline. For each  technical guideline, an evaluation of qualification or disqualification  shall be made in accordance with the requirements specified in subpart  B.</p>
