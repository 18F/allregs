                            <p class="depth0">In no instance shall there be discrimination against Indians or schools enrolling such Indians. When informed by a complainant or through its own discovery that possible violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 exists within a State school district receiving funds under this part, the Department of the Interior shall, in accordance with Federal requirements, notify the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare of the possible violation of title VI. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare will conduct an investigation into the matters alleged, pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. If the report of the investigation conducted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare discloses a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the non-compliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to contract or to continue financial assistance under the Johnson-O'Malley Act or by any other means authorized by law. As delineated in 43 CFR 17.1, 17.8, and 17.9, such other means may include reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate legal proceedings be brought by the United States to secure compliance or by formal hearing before the Commissioner or, at his discretion, before an administrative law judge designated in accordance with section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Secretary, may, by agreement with one or more other Federal departments, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings as prescribed in 43 CFR 17.8(e).</p>
