This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of each Federal election cycle, based upon the committee's Federal and non-Federal disbursements in a prior comparable Federal election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its Federal expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates. Calculation of total Federal and non-Federal disbursements shall also be limited to disbursements for specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or other generic costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual Federal and non-Federal disbursements made, to date. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers on its periodic reports, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Minimum Federal percentage for administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives. Regardless of the allocation ratio calculated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate to its Federal account at least 65% each of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives each year. If the committee's own allocation calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a Federal share greater than 65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied. If such calculation yields a Federal share lower than 65%, then the committee shall report its calculated ratio according to 11 CFR 104.10(b), and shall apply the required minimum Federal percentage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allocation of fundraising costs. Senate and House campaign committees shall allocate the costs of each combined Federal and non-Federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this section, with no minimum percentages required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)-(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> National party committees; method for allocating direct costs of fundraising. (1) If Federal and non-Federal funds are collected by one committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its Federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its Federal and non-Federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If Federal and non-Federal funds are collected by one committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its Federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its Federal and non-Federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both Federal and non-Federal funds are collected, the

committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event that serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the date for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment of allocable expenses by committees with separate Federal and non-Federal accounts--(1) Payment options.

(A) The committee shall establish a separate allocation account into which funds from its Federal and non-Federal accounts shall be deposited solely for the purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint Federal and non-Federal activities. Once a committee has established a separate allocation account for this purpose, all allocable expenses shall be paid from that account for as long as the account is maintained.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The committee shall establish a separate allocation account into which funds from its Federal and non-Federal accounts shall be deposited solely for the purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint Federal and non-Federal activities. Once a committee has established a separate allocation account for this purpose, all allocable expenses shall be paid from that account for as long as the account is maintained.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The committee shall transfer funds from its Federal and non-Federal accounts to its allocation account in amounts proportionate to the Federal or non-Federal share of each allocable expense.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> No funds contained in the allocation account may be transferred to any other account maintained by the committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timing of transfers between accounts. (i) Under either payment option described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, the committee shall transfer funds from its non-Federal account to its Federal account or from its Federal and non-Federal accounts to its separate allocation account following determination of the final cost of each joint Federal and non-Federal activity, or in advance of such determination if advance payment is required by the vendor and if such payment is based on a reasonable estimate of the activity's final cost as determined by the committee and the vendor(s) involved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under either payment option described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, the committee shall transfer funds from its non-Federal account to its Federal account or from its Federal and non-Federal accounts to its separate allocation account following determination of the final cost of each joint Federal and non-Federal activity, or in advance of such determination if advance payment is required by the vendor and if such payment is based on a reasonable estimate of the activity's final cost as determined by the committee and the vendor(s) involved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Funds transferred from a committee's non-Federal account to its Federal account or its allocation account are subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For each such transfer, the committee must itemize in its reports the allocable activities for which the transferred funds are intended to pay, as required by 11 CFR 104.10(b)(3); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, such funds may not be transferred more than 10 days before or more than 60 days after the payments for which they are designated are made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any portion of a transfer from a committee's non-Federal account to its Federal account or its allocation account that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section shall be presumed to be a loan or contribution from the non-Federal account to a Federal account, in violation of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reporting transfers of funds and allocated disbursements.
