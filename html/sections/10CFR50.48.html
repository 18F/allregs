As used in this section, references to NFPA 805 are to the 2001 Edition, with the following exceptions, modifications, and supplementation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Life Safety Goal, Objectives, and Criteria. The Life Safety Goal, Objectives, and Criteria of Chapter 1 are not endorsed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Plant Damage/Business Interruption Goal, Objectives, and Criteria. The Plant Damage/Business Interruption Goal, Objectives, and Criteria of Chapter 1 are not endorsed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use of feed-and-bleed. In demonstrating compliance with the performance criteria of Sections 1.5.1(b) and (c), a high-pressure charging/injection pump coupled with the pressurizer power-operated relief valves (PORVs) as the sole fire-protected safe shutdown path for maintaining reactor coolant inventory, pressure control, and decay heat removal capability (i.e., feed-and-bleed) for pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) is not permitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Uncertainty analysis. An uncertainty analysis performed in accordance with</p><p class="depth4">Section 2.7.3.5 is not required to support deterministic approach calculations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Existing cables. In lieu of installing cables meeting flame propagation tests as required by Section 3.3.5.3, a flame-retardant coating may be applied to the electric cables, or an automatic fixed fire suppression system may be installed to provide an equivalent level of protection. In addition, the italicized exception to Section 3.3.5.3 is not endorsed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Water supply and distribution. The italicized exception to Section 3.6.4 is not endorsed. Licensees who wish to use the exception to Section 3.6.4 must

submit a request for a license amendment in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Performance-based methods. Notwithstanding the prohibition in Section 3.1 against the use of performance-based methods, the fire protection program elements and minimum design requirements of Chapter 3 may be subject to the performance-based methods permitted elsewhere in the standard. Licensees who wish to use performance-based methods for these fire protection program elements and minimum design requirements shall submit a request in the form of an application for license amendment under Sec. 50.90. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, or a designee of the Director, may approve the application if the Director or designee determines that the performance-based approach;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Satisfies the performance goals, performance objectives, and performance criteria specified in NFPA 805 related to nuclear safety and radiological release;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Maintains safety margins; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Maintains fire protection defense-in-depth (fire prevention, fire detection, fire suppression, mitigation, and post-fire safe shutdown capability).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with NFPA 805.

The licensee shall submit a request to comply with NFPA 805 in the form of an application for license amendment under Sec. 50.90. The application must identify any orders and license conditions that must be revised or superseded, and contain any necessary revisions to the plant's technical specifications and the bases thereof. The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, or a designee of the Director, may approve the application if the Director or designee determines that the licensee has identified orders, license conditions, and the technical specifications that must be revised or superseded, and that any necessary revisions are adequate.

The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, or designee of the Director, may approve the application if the Director or designee determines that the proposed alternatives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Satisfy the performance goals, performance objectives, and performance criteria specified in NFPA 805 related to nuclear safety and radiological release;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maintain safety margins; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain fire protection defense-in-depth (fire prevention, fire detection, fire suppression, mitigation, and post-fire safe shutdown capability).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)-(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Licensees that have submitted the certifications required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) shall maintain a fire protection program to address the potential for fires that could cause the release or spread of radioactive materials (i.e., that could result in a radiological hazard). A fire protection program that complies with NFPA 805 shall be deemed to be acceptable for complying with the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The objectives of the fire protection program are to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reasonably prevent these fires from occurring;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rapidly detect, control, and extinguish those fires that do occur and

that could result in a radiological hazard; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that the risk of fire-induced radiological hazards to the public, environment and plant personnel is minimized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee shall assess the fire protection program on a regular basis. The licensee shall revise the plan as appropriate throughout the various stages of facility decommissioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee may make changes to the fire protection program without NRC approval if these changes do not reduce the effectiveness of fire protection for facilities, systems, and equipment that could result in a radiological hazard, taking into account the decommissioning plant conditions and activities.
