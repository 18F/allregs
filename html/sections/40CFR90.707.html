However, if the idle speed  parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to  adjustment, the Administrator may not adjust it or require that it be  adjusted to any setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than  would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the  idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 12 hours of  service on the engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other  parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison.  The manufacturer may be requested to supply information necessary to  establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making  or specifying these adjustments, may consider the   effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on  emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that  similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining  likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not  limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance  characteristics and information from similar in-use engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service accumulation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise approved by the  Administrator, prior to performing exhaust emission production line  testing, the manufacturer may accumulate up to 12 hours of service on  each test engine. For catalyst-equipped engines, the manufacturer must  accumulate a number of hours equal to the number of hours accumulated to  represent stabilized emissions on the engine used to obtain  certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good  engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of  production line engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer  may not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for  testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, all adjustments or repairs performed on test engines  prior to each test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an  emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request  that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its  deletion from the test sequence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Testing. A manufacturer must test engines with the test  procedure specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance  with the applicable FEL (or standard where there is no FEL). If  alternate or special test procedures pursuant to regulations at  Sec. 90.120 are used in certification, then those alternate procedures  must be used in production line testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Retesting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an engine manufacturer reasonably determines  that an emission test of an engine is invalid because of a procedural  error, test equipment problem, or engine performance problem that causes  the engine to be unable to safely perform a valid test, the engine may  be retested. A test is not invalid simply because the emission results  are high relative to other engines of the family. Emission results from  all tests must be reported to EPA. The engine manufacturer must also  include a detailed explanation of the reasons for invalidating any test  in the quarterly report required in Sec. 90.709(e). If a test is  invalidated because of an engine performance problem, the manufacturer  must document in detail the nature of the problem and the repairs  performed in order to use the after-repair test results for the original  test results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Routine retests may be conducted if the manufacturer conducts  the same number of tests on all engines in the family. The results of  these tests must be averaged according to procedures of Sec. 90.709.</p>
