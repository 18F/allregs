                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act requires that agreements be processed and reviewed, upon  their initial filing, according to strict statutory deadlines. This part  is intended to establish procedures for the orderly and expeditious  review of filed agreements in accordance with the statutory  requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Act requires that agreements be reviewed, upon their initial  filing, to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act  and empowers the Commission to obtain information to conduct that  review. This part identifies those types of agreements that must be  accompanied by information submissions when they are first filed, and  sets forth the kind of information for certain agreements that the  Commission believes relevant to that review. Only information that is  relevant to such a review is requested. It is the policy of the  Commission to keep the costs of regulation to a minimum and at the same  time obtain information needed to fulfill its statutory responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To further the goal of expedited processing and review of  agreements upon their initial filing, agreements are required to meet  certain minimum requirements as to form. These requirements are intended  to ensure expedited review and should assist parties in preparing  agreements. These requirements as to form do not affect the substance of  an agreement and are intended to allow parties the freedom to develop  innovative commercial relationships and provide efficient and economic  transportation systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Act itself excludes certain agreements from the filing  requirements and authorizes the Commission to exempt other classes of  agreements from any requirement of the Act or this part. To minimize  delay in the implementation of routine agreements and to avoid the  private and public cost of unnecessary regulation, certain classes of  agreements are exempt from the filing requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Under the regulatory framework established by the Act, the role  of the Commission as a monitoring agency has been enhanced. The Act  favors greater freedom in allowing parties to form their commercial  arrangements. This, however, requires greater monitoring of agreements  after they have become effective to assure their continued compliance  with all applicable provisions of the Act. The Act empowers the  Commission to impose certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements.  This part identifies those agreements that require specific record  retention and reporting to the Commission and prescribes the applicable  period of record retention, the form and content of such reporting, and  the applicable time periods for filing with the Commission. Only  information that is necessary to assure that the Commission's monitoring  responsibilities will be fulfilled is requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Act requires that conference agreements contain certain  mandatory provisions. Each conference agreement must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State its purpose;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for admission  and readmission to membership;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allow for withdrawal from membership upon reasonable notice  without penalty;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Require an independent neutral body to police the conference, if  requested by a member;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prohibit conduct specified in sections 10(c)(1) or 10(c)(3) of  the Act (46 U.S.C. 41105(1) or 41105(3));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Provide for a consultation process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Establish procedures for considering shippers' requests and  complaints; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Provide for independent action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To promote competitive and efficient transportation and a  greater reliance on the marketplace, the Act places limits on carriers'  agreements regarding service contracts. Carriers may not enter into an  agreement to prohibit or restrict members from engaging in contract  negotiations, may not require members to disclose service contract  negotiations or terms and conditions (other than those required to be  published), and may not adopt mandatory rules or requirements affecting  the right of an agreement member or agreement members to negotiate and  enter into contracts. However, agreement members may adopt voluntary  guidelines covering the terms and procedures of members' contracts.  [69 FR 64414, Nov. 4, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 50727, Oct. 1, 2009]</p>
