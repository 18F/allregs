                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains the rules that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. The Agency also has rules that it follows in processing Freedom of Information (FOI) requests for records submitted to it as Confidential Business Information (CBI). Such records are covered in subpart B of this part. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974 which are processed under 40 CFR part 16, will also be treated as FOIA requests under this subpart. This ensures that the requestor has access to all responsive records. Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular EPA activity may be provided to the public without following this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When documents responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs, such as, but not limited to, the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service, EPA will inform the requester of the steps necessary to obtain records from these sources.</p>
