                                Sec. 1944.665  Supervision and inspection of work.

                            <p class="depth0">Grantees are responsible for supervising all rehabilitation and repair work, as well as replacement housing financed with HPG assistance. After all HPG work has been completed, a final inspection must be done by a disinterested third party, such as local building and code enforcement officials. If there are no such officials serving the area where HPG activities will be undertaken, or if the grantee would also normally make such inspections, the grantee must use qualified contract or fee inspectors.
