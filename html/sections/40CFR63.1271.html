                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act, subpart A of this part (General Provisions), and in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in this section for purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Affirmative defense means, in the context of an enforcement proceeding, a response or defense put forward by a defendant, regarding which the defendant has the burden of proof, and the merits of which are independently and objectively evaluated in a judicial or administrative proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">Boiler means an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion and having the primary purpose of recovering and exporting thermal energy in the form of steam or hot water. Boiler also means any industrial furnace as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.</p><p class="depth0">BTEX means benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to one or more control devices. If gas or vapor from regulated equipment is routed to a process (e.g., to a fuel gas system), the conveyance system shall not be considered a closed-vent system and is not subject to closed-vent system standards.</p><p class="depth0">Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion of organic HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Compressor station means any permanent combination of compressors that move natural gas at increased pressure from fields, in transmission pipelines, or into storage.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either records an instantaneous data value at least once every hour or records hourly or more frequent block average values.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means any equipment used for recovering or oxidizing HAP or volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, absorbers, carbon absorbers, condensers, incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters. For the purposes of this subpart, if gas or vapor from regulated equipment is used, reused (i.e., injected into the flame zone of an enclosed combustion device), returned back to the process, or sold, then the recovery system used, including piping, connections, and flow inducing devices, is not considered to be a control device or a closed-vent system.</p><p class="depth0">Custody transfer means the transfer of natural gas after processing and/or treatment in the production operations to pipelines or any other forms of transportation.</p><p class="depth0">Facility means any grouping of equipment where natural gas is processed, compressed, or stored prior to entering a pipeline to a local distribution company or (if there is no local distribution company) to a final end user. Examples of a facility for this source category are: an underground natural gas storage operation; or a natural gas compressor station that receives natural gas via pipeline, from an underground natural gas storage operation, or from a natural gas processing plant. The emission points associated with these phases include, but are not limited to, process vents. Processes that may have vents include, but are not limited to, dehydration and compressor station engines.</p><p class="depth0">Facility, for the purpose of a major source determination, means natural gas transmission and storage equipment that is located inside the boundaries of an individual surface site (as defined in this section) and is connected by ancillary equipment, such as gas flow lines or power lines. Equipment that is part of a facility will typically be located within close proximity to other equipment located at the same facility. Natural gas transmission and storage equipment or groupings of

equipment located on different gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface unit areas, surface fee tracts, or surface lease tracts shall not be considered part of the same facility.</p><p class="depth0">Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a combustion device occupied by the flame envelope.</p><p class="depth0">Flare means a thermal oxidation system using an open flame (i.e., without enclosure).</p><p class="depth0">Flash tank. See the definition for gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator.</p><p class="depth0">Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is present in a line or whether the valve position would allow gas flow to be present in a line.</p><p class="depth0">Gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator means a two-or three-phase separator through which the ``rich'' glycol stream of a glycol dehydration unit is passed to remove entrained gas and hydrocarbon liquid. The GCG separator is commonly referred to as a flash separator or flash tank.</p><p class="depth0">Glycol dehydration unit means a device in which a liquid glycol (including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol) absorbent directly contacts a natural gas stream and absorbs water in a contact tower or absorption column (absorber). The glycol contacts and absorbs water vapor and other gas stream constituents from the natural gas and becomes ``rich'' glycol. This glycol is then regenerated in the glycol dehydration unit reboiler. The ``lean'' glycol is then recycled.</p><p class="depth0">Glycol dehydration unit baseline operations means operations representative of the large glycol dehydration unit operations as of June 17, 1999 and the small glycol dehydration unit operations as of August 23, 2011.

Glycol dehydration units in operation for less than 1 year shall document that the parameter values represent expected long-term operating conditions had process modifications not been made.</p><p class="depth0">Glycol dehydration unit process vent means the glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent and the vent from the GCG separator (flash tank), if present.</p><p class="depth0">Glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent means the vent through which exhaust from the reboiler of a glycol dehydration unit passes from the reboiler to the atmosphere or to a control device.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous air pollutants or HAP means the chemical compounds listed in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (Act).

Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy recovery section is not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit with the combustion section; rather, the energy recovery section is a separate section following the combustion section and the two are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas. The above energy recovery section limitation does not apply to an energy recovery section used solely to preheat the incoming vent stream or combustion air.</p><p class="depth0">Initial startup means the first time a new or reconstructed source begins production. For the purposes of this subpart, initial startup does not include subsequent startups (as defined in this section) of equipment, for example, following malfunctions or shutdowns.</p><p class="depth0">Large glycol dehydration unit means a glycol dehydration unit with an actual annual average natural gas flowrate equal to or greater than 283.0 thousand standard cubic meters per day and actual annual average benzene emissions equal to or greater than 0.90 Mg/yr, determined according to Sec.  63.1282(a).
