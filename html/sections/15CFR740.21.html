The export or reexport must be within one or more of the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The export or reexport to Cuba of donated items for use in scientific, archaeological, cultural, ecological, educational, historic preservation, or sporting activities. The activities may not relate to the ``development,'' ``production,'' ``use,'' operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul or refurbishing of any item enumerated or otherwise described on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121) or of any item enumerated or otherwise described on the Commerce Control List (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) unless the only reason for control that applies to that item as set forth in the ECCN that controls that item is anti-terrorism.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The temporary export or reexport to Cuba of items by travelers to Cuba for the travelers' use in scientific, archeological, cultural, ecological, educational, historic preservation, or sporting activities, or professional meetings or research.

To be eligible, the end-users must be ``U.S. Persons,'' as defined in Sec. 772.1 of the EAR, and must fall within one of the following categories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Entities organizing or conducting educational activities in Cuba authorized by the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) pursuant to 31 CFR 515.565(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entities providing mail or parcel transmission services authorized by OFAC pursuant to 31 CFR 515.542(a) or providing cargo transportation services in connection with trade involving Cuba authorized by OFAC or exempt from the prohibitions of 31 CFR part 515 as specified in 31 CFR 515.206;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Religious organizations engaging in religious activities in Cuba authorized by OFAC pursuant to 31 CFR 515.566;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Persons engaged in transactions authorized by OFAC pursuant to 31 CFR 515.559(b);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Persons that export or reexport items to Cuba that are exempt from the prohibitions of 31 CFR part 515 as specified in 31 CFR 515.206;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Providers of travel services or carrier services authorized by OFAC pursuant to 31 CFR 515.572; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Persons that export or reexport to Cuba pursuant to a license issued by BIS or a license exception authorized by Sec. 746.2(a)(1) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The export or reexport to Cuba of certain items for use by eligible end-users to establish, maintain, or operate a physical presence in Cuba.

Items authorized pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) are limited to those items of a type normally given away for free as gifts for promotional purposes that are designated as EAR99 (i.e., items subject to the EAR but not specified in any ECCN).</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (e). Any resulting payments associated with establishing maintaining or operating a physical presence in Cuba, such as lease payments, are permitted only to the extent authorized by Sec. 515.573 of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (31 CFR 515.573).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Temporary exports and reexports to Cuba. This paragraph (f) authorizes the export or reexport to Cuba, for periods not exceeding one year, of certain items designated as EAR99 or controlled only for anti-terrorism reasons on the CCL (i.e., anti-terrorism must be the only reason for control that applies to the item as set forth in the ECCN that controls the item). If any other reason for control applies to the item, it is not authorized for export or reexport by this paragraph. This paragraph does not authorize any transaction if the exporter or reexporter has ``knowledge'' that the item is intended to remain in Cuba for more than one year; if an order to acquire the item, such as a purchase order, has been received before shipment; or when the item is for subsequent lease or rental. The export or reexport must be within one or more of the following categories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tools of trade--commodities and software. Commodities or software to be used by the exporter or reexporter or its employees for the installation, servicing or repair of items that are subject to the EAR and that have been exported or reexported to Cuba under a license or license exception, or foreign-origin items that are not subject to the EAR that are owned and used exclusively by private sector entities in Cuba, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f). The commodities or software must remain under the ``effective control'' of the exporter or reexporter or its employees. Examples of security precautions to help prevent unauthorized access include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for activities that involve the transmission and use of the software authorized under this license exception;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of password systems on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tools of trade--technology. Technology to be used by a `U.S. person' exporter or reexporter or its employees who are traveling to or on temporary assignment in Cuba for the installation, servicing or repair of items that are subject to the EAR and that have been exported or reexported to Cuba under a license or license exception, or foreign-origin items that are not subject to the EAR that are owned and used exclusively by private sector entities in Cuba, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f). For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a `U.S. person' is: an individual who is a citizen of the United States, an individual who is ``lawfully admitted for permanent residence'' in the United States as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) or an individual who is a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). `U.S. person' also means any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States, or any jurisdiction within the United States (e.g., corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization or group that is authorized to do business in the United States). If the employee who will use the technology is not a `U.S. person,' the release of that technology to that employee must either not require a license or be authorized by a license or a license exception other than this section before it may be exported or reexported to that employee under this paragraph. The exporter or reexporter and the recipient of the technology must take security precautions to protect against unauthorized release of the technology while the technology is being shipped or transmitted and used overseas. Examples of security precautions to help

prevent unauthorized access include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for email and other business activities that involve the transmission and use of the technology authorized under this license exception;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of password systems on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Kits of replacement ``parts'' or ``components.'' Kits consisting of replacement ``parts'' or ``components'' for items that have been exported or reexported to Cuba under a license or license exception, or foreign-origin items that are not subject to the EAR that are owned and used exclusively by private sector entities in Cuba, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f)(3) provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The kits remain under ``effective control'' of the exporter or reexporter or its employees; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All parts and components in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License Exception Servicing and Replacement of Parts and Equipment (RPL) and the defective parts and components returned (see Parts, Components, Accessories and Attachments in Sec. 740.10(a)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exhibition and demonstration. Commodities or software for exhibition or demonstration at trade shows, or to any entity that would be eligible to receive the commodities or software under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f). The commodities or software must remain under the ``effective control'' of the exporter or reexporter or its private sector agent, may not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one location for more than 30 days and may not be used for more than the minimum extent required for effective exhibition or demonstration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Containers. Containers that would require a license for export or reexport to Cuba but that are necessary for shipment of commodities being exported to Cuba under a license or license exception may be exported or reexported to Cuba. However, this paragraph (f) does not authorize the export of the container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be separately authorized for export or reexport under either a license or a license exception.
