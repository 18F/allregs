                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any producer who produces less than 20,000 pounds of raspberries  for processing annually who desires to   claim an exemption from assessments during a fiscal year as provided in  Sec. 1208.52 shall apply to the Council, on a form provided by the  Council, for a certificate of exemption. Such producer shall certify  that the producer's production of raspberries for processing shall be  less than 20,000 pounds for the fiscal year for which the exemption is  claimed. Any importer who imports less than 20,000 pounds of processed  raspberries annually who desires to claim an exemption from assessments  during a fiscal year as provided in Sec. 1208.52 shall apply to the  Council, on a form provided by the Council, for a certificate of  exemption. Such importer shall certify that the importer's importation  of processed raspberries shall not exceed 20,000 pounds, for the fiscal  year for which the exemption is claimed. If a producer or importer  determines at the end of the year that they did not meet the 20,000  pounds minimum, the producer or importer can request a reimbursement on  the assessments paid to the Council by 60 days of the last day of the  year. If, after a person has been exempt from paying assessments for any  year pursuant to this section, and the person no longer meets the  requirements of paragraph of this section for an exemption, the person  shall file a report with the Council in the form and manner prescribed  by the Council and pay an assessment on or before March 15 of the  subsequent year on all raspberries for processing produced or processed  raspberries imported by such persons during the year for which the  person claimed the exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On receipt of an application, the Council shall determine  whether an exemption may be granted. The Council will then issue, if  deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to the producer or  importer which is eligible to receive one. Each producer who is exempt  from assessment must provide an exemption number as supplied by the  Council to the first handler in order to be exempt from the collection  of an assessment on raspberries for processing. First handlers shall  maintain records showing the exemptee's name and address along with the  exemption number assigned by the Council.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Importers who are eligible for reimbursement of assessments  collected by Customs shall apply to the Council for reimbursement of  such assessments paid. No interest will be paid on assessments collected  by Customs. Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted within 60 days  of the last day of the year the processed raspberries were actually  imported. Any claim for reimbursement submitted after sixty (60) days  will be considered null and void.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A producer who produces raspberries for processing who operates  under an approved National Organic Program (NOP) (7 CFR part 205) system  plan, produces only products that are eligible to be labeled as 100  percent organic under the NOP, and is not a split operation shall be  exempt from the payment of assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To obtain this exemption, an eligible producer shall submit a  request for exemption to the Council--on a form provided by the  Council--at any time initially and annually thereafter on or before the  beginning of the fiscal period as long as the producer continues to be  eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The request shall include the following: The producer's name and  address, a copy of the organic farm or organic handling operation  certificate provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent as defined in  the Organic Act, a signed certification that the applicant meets all of  the requirements specified for an assessment exemption, and such other  information as may be required by the Council and with the approval of  the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the producer complies with the requirements of paragraph (d)  of this section, the Council will grant an assessment exemption and  shall issue a Certificate of Exemption to the producer. For exemption  requests received on or before March 15 of the fiscal year, the Council  will have 60 days to approve the exemption request; after March 15 of  the fiscal year, the Council will have 30 days to approve the exemption  request. If the application is disapproved, the Council will notify the  applicant of the reason(s) for disapproval within the same timeframe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An importer who imports only products that are eligible to be  labeled as 100 percent organic under the NOP (7   CFR part 205) and who is not a split operation shall be exempt from the  payment of assessments. That importer may submit documentation to the  Council and request an exemption from assessment on 100 percent organic  processed raspberries--on a form provided by the Council--at any time  initially and annually thereafter on or before the beginning of the  fiscal period as long as the importer continues to be eligible for the  exemption. This documentation shall include the same information  required of a producer in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If the  importer complies with the requirements of this section, the Council  will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the  importer within the applicable timeframe. The Council will also issue  the importer a 9-digit alphanumeric Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS)  classification valid for 1 year from the date of issue. This HTS  classification should be entered by the importer on the Customs entry  documentation. Any line item entry of 100 percent organic processed  raspberries bearing this HTS classification assigned by the Council will  not be subject to assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any person who desires an exemption from assessments for a  subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the Council, on a form provided  by the Council, for a certificate of exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Council, with the Secretary's approval, may request that  persons claiming an exemption from assessments under Sec. 1208.53 must  provide it with any information it deems necessary about the exemption,  including, without limitation, the disposition of the exempted  commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The exemption will apply immediately following the issuance of  the certificate of exemption.</p>
