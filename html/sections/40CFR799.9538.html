                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section is intended to meet the testing requirements  under section 4 of TSCA. The mammalian bone marrow chromosomal  aberration test is used for the detection of structural chromosome  aberrations induced by test compounds in bone marrow cells of animals,  usually rodents. Structural chromosome aberrations may be of two types,  chromosome or chromatid. An increase in polyploidy may indicate that a  chemical has the potential to induce numerical aberrations. With the  majority of chemical mutagens, induced aberrations are of the chromatid- type, but chromosome-type aberrations also occur. Chromosome mutations  and related events are the cause of many human genetic diseases and  there is substantial evidence that chromosome mutations and related  events causing alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are  involved in cancer in humans and experimental systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Source. The source material used in developing this TSCA test  guideline is the OECD guideline 475 (February 1997). This source is  available at the address in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:</p><p class="depth0">Chromatid-type aberration is structural chromosome damage expressed  as breakage of single chromatids or breakage and reunion between  chromatids.</p><p class="depth0">Chromosome-type aberration is structural chromosome damage expressed  as breakage, or breakage and reunion, of both chromatids at an identical  site.</p><p class="depth0">Endoreduplication is a process in which after an S period of DNA  replication, the nucleus does not go into mitosis but starts another S  period. The result is chromosomes with 2,4,8,...chromatids.</p><p class="depth0">Gap is an achromatic lesion smaller than the width of one chromatid,  and   with minimum misalignment of the chromatids.</p><p class="depth0">Numerical aberration is a change in the number of chromosomes from  the normal number characteristic of the animals utilized.</p><p class="depth0">Polyploidy is a multiple of the haploid chromosome number (n) other  than the diploid number (i.e., 3n, 4n and so on).</p><p class="depth0">Structural aberration is a change in chromosome structure detectable  by microscopic examination of the metaphase stage of cell division,  observed as deletions and fragments, intrachanges or interchanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Initial considerations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rodents are routinely used in this  test. Bone marrow is the target tissue in this test, since it is a  highly vascularised tissue, and it contains a population of rapidly  cycling cells that can be readily isolated and processed. Other species  and target tissues are not the subject of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This chromosome aberration test is especially relevant to  assessing mutagenic hazard in that it allows consideration of factors of  in vivo metabolism, pharmacokinetics and DNA-repair processes although  these may vary among species and among tissues. An in vivo test is also  useful for further investigation of a mutagenic effect detected by an in  vitro test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If there is evidence that the test substance, or a reactive  metabolite, will not reach the target tissue, it is not appropriate to  use this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Principle. Animals are exposed to the test  substance by an appropriate route of exposure and are sacrificed at  appropriate times after treatment. Prior to sacrifice, animals are  treated with a metaphase-arresting agent (e.g., colchicine or Colcemid  [supreg]). Chromosome preparations are then made from the bone marrow  cells and stained, and metaphase cells are analyzed for chromosome  aberrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Preparations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Selection of animal species.  Rats, mice and Chinese hamsters are commonly used, although any  appropriate mammalian species may be used. Commonly used laboratory  strains of young healthy adult animals should be employed. At the  commencement of the study, the weight variation of animals should be  minimal and not exceed 20% of the mean weight of  each sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Housing and feeding conditions. The temperature in the  experimental animal room should be 22 [deg]C 3  [deg]C). Although the relative humidity should be at least 30% and  preferably not exceed 70% other than during room cleaning, the aim  should be 50-60%. Lighting should be artificial, the sequence being 12  hrs light, 12 hrs dark. For feeding, conventional laboratory diets may  be used with an unlimited supply of drinking water. The choice of diet  may be influenced by the need to ensure a suitable admixture of a test  substance when administered by this method. Animals may be housed  individually, or be caged in small groups of the same sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Preparation of the animals. Healthy young adult animals shall be  randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups. Cages should be  arranged in such a way that possible effects due to cage placement are  minimized. The animals are identified uniquely. The animals are  acclimated to the laboratory conditions for at least 5 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Preparation of doses. Solid test substances shall be dissolved  or suspended in appropriate solvents or vehicles and diluted, as  appropriate, prior to dosing of the animals. Liquid test substances may  be dosed directly or diluted prior to dosing. Fresh preparations of the  test substance should be employed unless stability data demonstrate the  acceptability of storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Test conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Solvent/vehicle. The solvent/vehicle shall  not produce toxic effects at the dose levels used, and shall not be  suspected of chemical reaction with the test substance. If other than  well-known solvents/vehicles are used, their inclusion should be  supported with data indicating their compatibility. It is recommended  that wherever possible, the use of an aqueous solvent/vehicle should be  considered first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Controls. (1) Concurrent positive and negative (solvent/vehicle)  controls shall be included for each sex in each test. Except for  treatment with the test substance, animals in the control   groups should be handled in an identical manner to the animals in the  treated groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Positive controls shall produce structural chromosome  aberrations in vivo at exposure levels expected to give a detectable  increase over background. Positive control doses should be chosen so  that the effects are clear but do not immediately reveal the identity of  the coded slides to the reader. It is acceptable that the positive  control be administered by a route different from the test substance and  sampled at only a single time. The use of chemical class related  positive control chemicals may be considered, when available. Examples  of positive control substances include:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Chemical                              CAS No. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Triethylenemelamine.......................  [CAS no. 51-18-3] Ethyl methanesulphonate...................  [CAS no. 62-50-0] Ethyl nitrosourea.........................  [CAS no. 759-73-9] Mitomycin C...............................  [CAS no. 50-07-7] Cyclophosphamide (monohydrate)............  [CAS no. 50-18-0]</p><p class="depth0">[CAS no. 6055-19-2] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Negative controls, treated with solvent or vehicle alone, and  otherwise treated in the same way as the treatment groups, shall be  included for every sampling time, unless acceptable inter-animal  variability and frequencies of cells with chromosome aberrations are  available from historical control data. If single sampling is applied  for negative controls, the most appropriate time is the first sampling  time. In the absence of historical or published control data  demonstrating that no deleterious or mutagenic effects are induced by  the chosen solvent/vehicle, untreated animals should be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Number and sex of animals. Each treated and  control group shall include at least 5 analyzable animals per sex. If at  the time of the study there are data available from studies in the same  species and using the same route of exposure that demonstrate that there  are no substantial differences in toxicity between sexes, then testing  in a single sex will be sufficient. Where human exposure to chemicals  may be sex-specific, as for example with some pharmaceutical agents, the  test should be performed with animals of the appropriate sex.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment schedule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Test substances are preferably  administered as a single treatment. Test substances may also be  administered as a split dose, i.e. two treatments on the same day  separated by no more than a few hrs, to facilitate administering a large  volume of material. Other dose regimens should be scientifically  justified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Samples shall be taken at two separate times following treatment  on one day. For rodents, the first sampling interval is 1.5 normal cell  cycle length (the latter being normally 12-18 hr) following treatment.  Since the time required for uptake and metabolism of the test substance  as well as its effect on cell cycle kinetics can affect the optimum time  for chromosome aberration detection, a later sample collection 24 hr  after the first sample time is recommended. If dose regimens of more  than one day are used, one sampling time at 1.5 normal cell cycle  lengths after the final treatment should be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Prior to sacrifice, animals shall be injected intraperitoneally  with an appropriate dose of a metaphase arresting agent (e.g. Colcemid  [supreg] or colchicine). Animals are sampled at an appropriate interval  thereafter. For mice this interval is approximately 3-5 hrs; for Chinese  hamsters this interval is approximately 4-5 hrs. Cells shall be  harvested from the bone marrow and analyzed from chromosome aberrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dose levels. If a range finding study is performed because  there are no suitable data available, it shall be performed in the same  laboratory, using the same species, strain, sex, and treatment regimen  to be used in the main study (an approach to dose selection is presented  in the reference under paragraph (g)(5) of this section). If there is  toxicity, three dose levels shall be used for the first sampling time.  These dose levels shall cover a range from the maximum to little or no  toxicity. At the later sampling time only the highest dose needs to be  used. The highest dose is defined as the dose producing signs of  toxicity such that higher dose levels, based on the same dosing regimen,  would be expected to produce lethality. Substances with specific  biological activities at low non-   toxic doses (such as hormones and mitogens) may be exceptions to the  dose-setting criteria and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  The highest dose may also be defined as a dose that produces some  indication of toxicity in the bone marrow (e.g. greater than 50%  reduction in mitotic index).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limit test. If a test at one dose level of at least 2,000 mg/kg  body weight using a single treatment, or as two treatments on the same  day, produces no observable toxic effects, and if genotoxicity would not  be expected based on data from structurally related compounds, then a  full study using three dose levels may not be considered necessary. For  studies of a longer duration, the limit dose is 2,000 mg/kg/body weight/ day for treatment up to 14 days, and 1,000 mg/kg/body weight/day for  treatment longer than 14 days. Expected human exposure may indicate the  need for a higher dose level to be used in the limit test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Administration of doses. The test substance is usually  administered by gavage using a stomach tube or a suitable intubation  cannula, or by intraperitoneal injection. Other routes of exposure may  be acceptable where they can be justified. The maximum volume of liquid  that can be administered by gavage or injection at one time depends on  the size of the test animal. The volume should not exceed 2 ml/100g body  weight. The use of volumes higher than these must be justified. Except  for irritating or corrosive substances which will normally reveal  exacerbated effects with higher concentrations, variability in test  volume should be minimized by adjusting the concentration to ensure a  constant volume at all dose levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Chromosome preparation. Immediately after sacrifice, bone  marrow shall be obtained, exposed to hypotonic solution and fixed. The  cells shall be then spread on slides and stained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Analysis. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The mitotic index should be determined as a  measure of cytotoxicity in at least 1,000 cells per animal for all  treated animals (including positive controls) and untreated negative  control animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> At least 100 cells should be analyzed for each animal. This  number could be reduced when high numbers of aberrations are observed.  All slides, including those of positive and negative controls, shall be  independently coded before microscopic analysis. Since slide preparation  procedures often result in the breakage of a proportion of metaphases  with loss of chromosomes, the cells scored should therefore contain a  number of centromeres equal to the number 2n 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Data and reporting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. Individual animal  data shall be presented in tabular form. The experimental unit is the  animal. For each animal the number of cells scored, the number of  aberrations per cell and the percentage of cells with structural  chromosome aberration(s) shall be evaluated. Different types of  structural chromosome aberrations shall be listed with their numbers and  frequencies for treated and control groups. Gaps shall be recorded  separately and reported but generally not included in the total  aberration frequency. If there is no evidence for a difference in  response between the sexes, the data may be combined for statistical  analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation and interpretation of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are several  criteria for determining a positive result, such as a dose-related  increase in the relative number of cells with chromosome aberrations or  a clear increase in the number of cells with aberrations in a single  dose group at a single sampling time. Biological relevance of the  results should be considered first. Statistical methods may be used as  an aid in evaluating the test results (some statistical methods are  described in the reference under paragraph (g)(6) of this section).  Statistical significance should not be the only determining factor for a  positive response. Equivocal results should be clarified by further  testing preferably using a modification of experimental conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An increase in polyploidy may indicate that the test substance  has the potential to induce numerical chromosome aberrations. An  increase in endoreduplication may indicate that the test substance has  the potential to inhibit cell cycle progression. This phenomenon is  described in the references under paragraphs (g)(7) and (g)(8) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A test substance for which the results do not meet the  criteria described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is considered  non-mutagenic in this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Although most experiments will give clearly positive or  negative results, in rare cases the data set will preclude making a  definite judgment about the activity of the test substance. Results may  remain equivocal or questionable regardless of the number of experiments  performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Positive results from the in vivo chromosome aberration test  indicate that a substance induces chromosome aberrations in the bone  marrow of the species tested. Negative results indicate that, under the  test conditions, the test substance does not induce chromosome  aberrations in the bone marrow of the species tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The likelihood that the test substance or its metabolites reach  the general circulation or specifically the target tissue (e.g.,  systemic toxicity) should be discussed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test report. The test report shall include the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test substance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Identification data and CAS No., if known.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Physical nature and purity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Physicochemical properties relevant to the conduct of the study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Stability of the test substance, if known.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solvent/vehicle:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Justification for choice of vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Solubility and stability of the test substance in solvent/ vehicle, if known.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Test animals:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Species/strain used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Number, age and sex of animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Source, housing conditions, diet, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Individual weight of the animals at the start of the test,  including body weight range, mean and standard deviation for each group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Test conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Positive and negative (vehicle/solvent) controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Data from range-finding study, if conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Rationale for dose level selection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Details of test substance preparation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Details of the administration of the test substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Rationale for route of administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Methods for verifying that the test substance reached the  general circulation or target tissue, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Conversion from diet/drinking water test substance concentration  parts per million (ppm) to the actual dose (mg/kg body weight/day), if  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Details of food and water quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Detailed description of treatment and sampling schedules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Methods for measurement of toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Identity of metaphase arresting substance, its concentration and  duration of treatment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Methods of slide preparation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> Criteria for scoring aberrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> Number of cells analyzed per animal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> Criteria for considering studies as positive, negative or  equivocal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Results:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Signs of toxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Mitotic index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Type and number of aberrations, given separately for each  animal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Total number of aberrations per group with means and standard  deviations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Number of cells with aberrations per group with means and  standard deviations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Changes in ploidy, if seen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Dose-response relationship, where possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Statistical analyses, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Concurrent negative control data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Historical negative control data with ranges, means and standard  deviations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Concurrent positive control data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Discussion of the results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Conclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> References.
