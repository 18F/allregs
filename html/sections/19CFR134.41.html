                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Suggested methods of marking. Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), requires that the marking of the country of origin be legible, indelible, and permanent. Definite methods of marking are prescribed only for articles provided for in Sec. 134.43 and for articles which are the objects of special rulings by the Commissioner of Customs. As a general rule, marking requirements are best met by marking worked into the article at the time of manufacture. For example, it is suggested that the country of origin on metal articles be die sunk, molded in or etched; on earthenware or chinaware be glazed on in the process of firing; and on paper articles be imprinted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Degree of permanence and visibility. The degree of permanence should be at least sufficient to insure that in any reasonably foreseeable circumstance, the marking shall remain on the article (or its container) until it reaches the ultimate purchaser unless it is deliberately removed. The marking must survive normal distribution and store handling. The ultimate purchaser in the United States must be able to find the marking easily and read it without strain.</p>
