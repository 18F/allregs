                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for  each successive 15-minute period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each  successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on  control device operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and  validation check of the CPMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available  necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system  and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled  coating operation is operating, except during   monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality  assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration  checks and required zero and span adjustments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must not use emission capture system or add-on control  device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions,  associated repairs, out of control periods, or required quality  assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must  use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the  data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture  system and add-on control device operating limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not  reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data.  Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or  careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the  monitoring system is out of control and data are not available for  required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this section for each emission capture system  that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the  add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that  takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. The flow indicator shall  be installed at the entrance to any bypass line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secure the bypass line valve in the nondiverting position with a  car-seal or lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the  seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month  to ensure the valve is maintained in the nondiverting position, and the  vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a thermal oxidizer, install a gas temperature monitor in the  firebox of the thermal oxidizer or in the duct immediately downstream of  the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you establish operating limits according to Sec.  63.3556(b)(1) and (2), then you must install the gas temperature  monitors both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed. The  temperature monitors must be in the gas stream at the inlet to and the  outlet of the catalyst bed to measure the temperature difference across  the bed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you establish operating limits according to Sec.  63.3556(b)(3) and (4), then you must install a gas temperature monitor  upstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitor must be in the gas  stream at the inlet to the catalyst bed to measure the temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (ii) of this  section for each gas temperature monitoring device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a  representative temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use a temperature sensor with a minimum accuracy of 1.2 degrees Celsius or 1 percent  of the temperature value in degrees Celsius, whichever is larger.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> and (2) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regeneration desorbing gas mass flow monitor must be an  integrating device having an accuracy of 10  percent capable of recording the total regeneration desorbing gas mass  flow for each regeneration cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The carbon bed temperature monitor must have a minimum accuracy  of 1.2 degrees Celsius or 1  percent of the   temperature value in degrees Celsius, whichever is larger, and must be  capable of recording the temperature within 15 minutes of completing any  carbon bed cooling cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gas temperature monitor must have a minimum accuracy of  1.2 degrees Celsius or 1  percent of the temperature value in degrees Celsius, whichever is  larger.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The temperature monitor must provide a continuous gas  temperature record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install a temperature monitor at the inlet to the  desorption/reactivation zone of the concentrator. The temperature  monitor must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (c)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must select an indicator(s) of performance of the  desorption/reactivation fan operation, such as speed, power, static  pressure, or flow rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must monitor the rotational speed of the concentrator in  revolutions per hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must verify the performance of the adsorbent material by  examining representative samples and testing adsorbent activity per the  manufacturer's recommendations.
