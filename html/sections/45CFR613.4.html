                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where to make a request. An individual may request amendment of  records pertaining to him or her that are maintained in an NSF Privacy  Act system of records, except that certain records described in  paragraph (h) of this section are exempt from amendment. Request for  amendment of records must be made in writing to the NSF Privacy Act  Officer, National Science Foundation, Suite 1265, 4201 Wilson Boulevard,  Arlington, VA 22230.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How to make a request. Your request should identify each  particular record in question, state the amendment you want to take  place and specify why you believe that the record is not accurate,  relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any documentation that you  think would be helpful. Providing an edited copy of the record(s)  showing the desired change will assist the agency in making a  determination about your request. If you believe that the same  information is maintained in more than one NSF system of records you  should include that information in your request. You must sign your  request and provide verification of your identity as specified in  613.2(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timing of responses to requests. The Privacy Act Officer, or his  or her designee, will acknowledge receipt of request for amendment  within 10 working days of receipt. Upon receipt of a proper request the  Privacy Act Officer will promptly confer with the NSF Directorate or  Office with responsibility for the record to determine if the request  should be granted in whole or part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Granting request for amendment. When a determination is made to  grant a request for amendment in whole or part, notification to the  requester will be made as soon as possible, normally within 30 wording  days of the Privacy Act Officer receiving the request, describing the  amendment made and including a copy of the amended record, in  disclosable form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Denying request for amendment. When a determination is made that  amendment, in whole or part, is unwarranted, the matter shall be brought  to the attention of the Inspector General, if it pertains to records  maintained by the Office of the Inspector General, or to the attention  of the General Counsel, if it pertains to other NSF records. If the  General Counsel or Inspector General or their designee agrees with the  determination that amendment is not warranted, the Privacy Act Officer  will notify the requester in writing, normally within 30 working days of  the Privacy Act Officer receiving the request. The notification letter  will be signed by the Privacy Act Officer or his or her designee, and  will include a statement of the reason(s) for the denial and how to  appeal the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Appealing a denial. You may appeal a denial of a request to  amend records to the General Counsel, National Science Foundation, 4201  Wilson Blvd., Suite 1265, Arlington, VA 22230. You must make your appeal  in writing and it must be received by the Office of the General Counsel  within ten days of the receipt of the denial (weekends, legal holidays,  and the date of receipt excluded). Clearly mark your appeal letter and  envelope ``Privacy Act Appeal.'' Your appeal letter must include a copy  of your original request for amendment and the denial letter, along with  any additional documentation or argument you wish to submit in favor of  amending the records. It must be signed by you or your officially  designated representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Responses to appeals. The General Counsel, or his or her  designee, will normally render a decision on the appeal within thirty  working days after proper receipt of the written appeal by the General  Counsel. If additional time to make a determination is necessary you  will be advised in writing of the need for an extension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amendment appeal granted. If on appeal the General Counsel, or  his or her designee, determines that amendment of the record should take  place, you will be notified as soon as possible of the Foundation's  decision. The notification will describe the amendment made and include  a copy of the amended record, in disclosable form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amendment appeal denied--Statement of disagreement. If on appeal  the General Counsel, or his or her designee, upholds a denial of a  request for amendment of records, you will be notified in writing of the  reasons why the appeal was denied and advised of your right to seek  judicial review of the decision. The letter will also notify you of your  right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the  reasons for your disagreement with the refusal of the Foundation to  amend the record. The statement should be sent to the Privacy Act  Officer, who will ensure that a copy of the statement is placed with the  disputed record. A copy of the statement will be included with any  subsequent disclosure of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records not subject to amendment. The following records are not  subject to amendment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements  made under oath;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or  quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those  proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pre-sentence records that originated with the courts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records in systems of records that have been exempted from  amendment under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by notice published  in the Federal Register.</p>
