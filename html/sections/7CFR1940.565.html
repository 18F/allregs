                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of this subpart. The criteria used in the basic formula  are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural occupied  substandard units,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State's percentage of the National rural population,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State's percentage of the National rural population in places of  less than 2,500 population,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural households  between 50 and 80 percent of the area median income, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural households  below 50 percent of the area median income.  Data source for each of these criteria is based on the latest census  data available. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according  to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each  criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a  basic State factor (SF)  SF = (criterion 1 x weight of 25%) + (criterion 2 x weight of 10%) +  (criterion 3 x weight of 15%) + (criterion 4 x weight of 30%) +  (criterion 5 x weight of 20%)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this subpart. The  percentage range used for Section 502 subsidized RH loans is plus or  minus 15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of this subpart.  Jurisdictions receiving administrative allocations do not receive base  allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> of this  subpart. Jurisdictions receiving formula allocations do not receive  administrative allocations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mid-year: If used in a particular fiscal year, available funds  unobligated as of the pooling date are pooled and redistributed based on  the formula used to allocate funds initially.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Year-end: Pooled funds are placed in a National Office reserve  and are available as determined administratively.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> of  this subpart. The State Director will suballocate funds to the District  Offices and may, at his/her option, suballocate to the County Offices.  The State Director will use the same basic formula criteria, data source  and weight for suballocating funds within the State as used by the  National Office in allocating to the States as described in  Sec. 1940.565 (b) and (c) of this section. The suballocations to  District or County Offices will not be reduced or restricted unless  written approval is received from the National Office in response to a  written request from the State Director. The State Director's request  must include the reasons for the requested action (e.g., high housing  inventory and/or high housing delinquency).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Other documentation.
