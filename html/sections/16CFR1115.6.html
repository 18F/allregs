                                Sec. 1115.6  Reporting of unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General provision. Every manufacturer, distributor, and retailer  of a consumer product distributed in commerce who obtains information  which reasonably supports the conclusion that its product creates an  unreasonable risk of serious injury or death is required to notify the  Commission immediately. 15 U.S.C. 2064(b)(3). The requirement that  notification occur when a responsible party ``obtains information which  reasonably supports the conclusion that'' its product creates an  unreasonable risk of serious injury or death is intended to require  firms to report even when no final determination of the risk is  possible. Firms must carefully analyze the information they obtain to  determine whether such information ``reasonably supports'' a  determination that the product creates an unreasonable risk of serious  injury or death. (See Sec. 1115.12(f) for a discussion of the kinds of  information that firms must study and evaluate to determine whether they  have an obligation to report.) Firms that obtain information indicating  that their products present an unreasonable risk of serious injury or  death should not wait for such serious injury or death to actually occur  before reporting. Such information can include reports from experts,  test reports, product liability lawsuits or claims, consumer or customer  complaints, quality control data, scientific or epidemiological studies,  reports of injury, information from other firms or governmental  entities, and other relevant information. While such information shall  not trigger a per se reporting requirement, in its evaluation of whether  a subject firm is required to file a report under the provisions of  section 15 of the CPSA, the Commission shall attach considerable  significance if such firm learns that a court or jury has determined  that one of its products has caused a serious injury or death and a  reasonable person could conclude based on the lawsuit and other  information obtained by the firm that the product creates an  unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unreasonable risk. The use of the term ``unreasonable risk''  suggests that the risk of injury presented by a product should be  evaluated to determine if that risk is a reasonable one. In determining  whether a product presents an unreasonable risk, the firm   should examine the utility of the product, or the utility of the aspect  of the product that causes the risk, the level of exposure of consumers  to the risk, the nature and severity of the hazard presented, and the  likelihood of resulting serious injury or death. In its analysis, the  firm should also evaluate the state of the manufacturing or scientific  art, the availability of alternative designs or products, and the  feasibility of eliminating the risk. The Commission expects firms to  report if a reasonable person could conclude given the information  available that a product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury  or death. In its evaluation of whether a subject firm is required to  file a report under the provisions of section 15 of the CPSA the  Commission shall, as a practical matter, attach considerable  significance if such firm obtains information which reasonably supports  the conclusion that its product violates a standard or ban promulgated  under the FHSA, FFA, PPPA or RSA and the violation could result in  serious injury or death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Serious injury or death. The term ``serious injury'' is not  defined in the CPSA. The Commission believes that the term includes not  only the concept of ``grievous bodily injury,'' defined at Sec.  1115.12(d), but also any other significant injury. Injuries  necessitating hospitalization which require actual medical or surgical  treatment, fractures, lacerations requiring sutures, concussions,  injuries to the eye, ear, or internal organs requiring medical  treatment, and injuries necessitating absence from school or work of  more than one day are examples of situations in which the Commission  shall presume that such a serious injury has occurred. To determine  whether an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death exists, the firm  should evaluate chronic or long term health effects as well as immediate  injuries.
