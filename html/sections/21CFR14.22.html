                                Sec. 14.22  Meetings of an advisory committee.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No advisory committee may conduct a meeting except at the call  or with the advance approval of, and with an agenda approved by, the  designated Federal employee or alternate. No meeting may be held in the  absence of the designated Federal employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If any matter is added to the agenda after its publication in  the Federal Register under Sec. 14.20(b)(4), an attempt is to be made  to inform persons known to be interested in the matter, and the change  is to be announced at the beginning of the open portion of the meeting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The advisory committee meeting is to be conducted in accordance  with the approved final agenda insofar as practical.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advisory committee meetings will be held at places that are  reasonably accessible to the public. All advisory committee meetings  will be held in Washington, DC, or Rockville, MD, or the immediate  vicinity, unless the Commissioner receives and approves a written  request from the advisory committee for a different location. A  different location may be approved when one or more of the following  applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total cost of the meeting to the Government will be reduced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A substantial number of the committee members will be at the  location at no expense to FDA for other reasons, e.g., for a meeting of  a professional association.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is a central location more readily accessible to committee  members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There is a need for increased participation available at that  location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The committee wishes to review work or facilities in a specific  location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The committee is concerned with matters that functionally or  historically occur in some other location, e.g., the Science Advisory  Board of the National Center for Toxicological Research will generally  hold meetings in the Little Rock, AR, vicinity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advisory committee members may, with the approval of FDA,  conduct onsite visits relevant to their work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless the committee charter provides otherwise, a quorum for an  advisory committee is a majority of the current voting members of the  committee, except as provided in Sec. 14.125(c) for TEPRSSC. Any matter  before the advisory committee is to be decided by a majority vote of the  voting members present at the time, except that the designated Federal  official may require that any final report be voted upon by all current  voting members of the committee. Any current voting member of the  committee may file a separate report with additional or minority views.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If space is available, any interested person may attend any  portion of any advisory committee meeting which is not closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever feasible, meetings are to be held in government  facilities or other facilities involving the least expense to the  public. The size of the meeting room is to be reasonable, considering  such factors as the size of the committee, the number of persons  expected to attend a meeting, and the resources and facilities  available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Commissioner may authorize a meeting to be held by  conference telephone call. For these meetings, a speaker phone will be  provided in a conference room located in Washington, DC, or Rockville,  MD, or the immediate vicinity, to permit public participation in open  portions of the meetings, as provided in Sec. Sec. 14.25 and 14.29.  These meetings generally will be brief, and authorized--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of taking final votes or otherwise confirming  actions taken by the committee at other meetings; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where time does not permit a meeting to be held at a central  location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any portion of a meeting will be closed by the committee  Chairperson only when matters are to be discussed which the Commissioner  has determined may be considered in closed session under Sec. 14.27(b).  If a portion of the meeting is closed, the closed portion will be held  after the conclusion of the open portion whenever practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Any committee member may take notes during meetings and report  and discuss committee deliberations after a meeting is completed and  before official minutes or a report are available, within the rules and  regulations adopted by FDA and by the advisory committee with the  concurrence of FDA, including all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There may be no attribution of individual views expressed in a  closed session or revealing of numerical votes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There may be no reporting or discussion of any particular matter  if the committee or FDA specifically so directs, e.g., where  deliberations are incomplete or involve a sensitive regulatory decision  that requires preparation or implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There may be no reporting or discussion of information  prohibited from public disclosure under Sec. 14.75.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notes or minutes kept or reports prepared by a committee member  have no status or effect unless adopted into the official minutes or  report by the committee.
