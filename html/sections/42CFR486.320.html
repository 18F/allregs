The term ``rules and requirements of the OPTN'' means  those rules and requirements approved by the Secretary. No OPO is  considered out of compliance with section 1138(b)(1)(D) of the Act or  this section until the Secretary approves a determination that the OPO  failed to comply with the rules and requirements of the OPTN. The  Secretary may impose sanctions under section 1138 only after such non- compliance has been determined in this manner.</p>
