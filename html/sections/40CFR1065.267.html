                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. You may use a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to measure CH4 concentrations of diluted exhaust for batch sampling. While you may also use a nonmethane cutter to measure CH4, as described in Sec.  1065.265, use a reference procedure based on a gas chromatograph for comparison with any proposed alternate measurement procedure under Sec.  1065.10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Component requirements. We recommend that you use a GC-FID that meets the specifications in Table 1 of Sec.  1065.205 and that the measurement be done according to SAE J1151 (incorporated by reference in Sec.  1065.1010). The GC-FID must meet the linearity verification in Sec.  1065.307.
