                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b) attributable to payments made after  December 31, 1992. Railroad retirement taxes described in section  3221(c) arising during the month must be deposited on or before the  first date after the 15th day of the following month on which taxes are  otherwise required to be deposited under Sec. 31.6302-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Separate application of deposit rules. A person who accumulates  tax under sections 3202 or 3221 shall not   take that tax into account for purposes of determining when taxes  described in paragraph (e) of Sec. 31.6302-1 must otherwise be  deposited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> for an entire calendar year  unless the amount of R.R.T.A. taxes required to be deposited under this  section during the lookback period was more than $50,000. The lookback  period is defined as the calendar year preceding the calendar year just  ended. Thus, for purposes of determining if an R.R.T.A. employer  qualifies to use the Monthly rule for calendar year 1993, a lookback  must be made to calendar year 1991. New employers shall be treated as  having employment tax liabilities of zero for any calendar year during  which the employer did not exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> for the remainder of the calendar year and the following  calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to deposits  and payments made after December 31, 2010.  [T.D. 8436, 57 FR 44105, Sept. 24, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9507, 75 FR  75903, Dec. 7, 2010]</p>
