                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The standards set forth in this section apply to the compromise  of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. The General Services Administration  (GSA) may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of  activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to,  the Agency when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest,  penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any  higher amount authorized by the Attorney General. The Administrator may  designate other GSA officials to exercise the authorities in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of  a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs,  exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney  General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the  Department of Justice. GSA will evaluate the compromise offer, using the  factors set forth in Sec. 105-55.020. If an offer to compromise any  debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the Agency, GSA will refer  the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division  in the Department of Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation  Report. The referral will include appropriate financial information and  a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice  Department approval is not required if GSA rejects a compromise offer.</p>
