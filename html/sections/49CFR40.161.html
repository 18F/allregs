                            <p class="depth0">As the MRO, when the laboratory reports that the specimen is rejected for testing (e.g., because of a fatal or uncorrected flaw), you must do the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Place a check mark in the ``Test Cancelled'' box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter the reason on the ``Remarks'' line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Report to the DER that the test is cancelled and the reason for cancellation, and that no further action is required unless a negative test is required (e.g., in the case of a pre-employment, return-to-duty, or follow-up test).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may only report a test cancelled because of a rejected for testing test result when you are in possession of a legible copy of Copy 1 of the CCF. In addition, you must have Copy 2 of the CCF, a legible copy of it, or any other copy of the CCF containing the employee's signature.</p>
