                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Language of the plan. The shipboard oil pollution emergency plan  must be available on board in English and in the working language of the  master and the officers of the ship, if other than English.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plan format. The plan must contain the following six sections. A  seventh non-mandatory section may be included at the shipowner's  discretion:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction. This section must contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Introductory text. The introductory text of the plan must  contain the following language (For ships operating in Antarctica, the  introductory text of the plan must contain the following language and  explain that they are in accordance with the Protocol on Environmental  Protection to the Antarctic Treaty):</p><p class="depth0">This plan is written in accordance with the requirements of  Regulation 37 of Annex I of the International Convention for the  Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of  1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78).</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of the plan is to provide guidance to the master and  officers on board the ship with respect to the steps to be taken when a  pollution incident has occurred or is likely to occur.</p><p class="depth0">The plan contains all information and operational instructions  required by the guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32) as amended by  Resolution MEPC.86(44)). The appendices contain names, telephone  numbers, telex numbers, etc. of all contacts referenced in the plan, as  well as other reference material.</p><p class="depth0">This plan has been approved by the Coast Guard and, except as  provided below, no alteration or revision may be made to any part   of it without the prior approval of the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth0">Changes to the seventh section of the plan and the appendices do not  require approval by the Coast Guard. The appendices must be maintained  up-to-date by the owners, operators, and managers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The ship's name, call sign, official number, International  Maritime Organization (IMO) international number, and principal  characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preamble. The plan must be realistic, practical, and easy to  use, and the Preamble section of the plan must reflect these three  features of the plan. The use of flowcharts, checklists, and appendices  within the plan will aid in addressing this requirement. This section  must contain an explanation of the purpose and use of the plan and  indicate how the shipboard plan relates to other shore-based plans.  Additionally, the Preamble section of the plan must clearly recognize  coastal States' rights to approve oil pollution response in their waters  by stating the following:</p><p class="depth0">Without interfering with shipowner's liability, some coastal States  consider that it is their responsibility to define techniques and means  to be taken against an oil pollution incident and approve such  operations that might cause further pollution, i.e., lightening. States  are entitled to do so under the International Convention relating to  Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969  (Intervention Convention).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reporting Requirements. This section of the plan must include  information relating to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When to report. A report shall be made whenever an incident  involves--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A discharge of oil above the permitted level for any reason,  including those for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or  saving life at sea;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A discharge of oil or oily mixture during the operation of the  ship in excess of the quantities or instantaneous rate permitted in  Sec. 151.10 of this subpart or in Sec. 157.37 of this subchapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A probable discharge. Factors to be considered in determining  whether a discharge is probable include, but are not limited to: ship  location and proximity to land or other navigational hazards, weather,  tide, current, sea state, and traffic density. The master must make a  report in cases of collision, grounding, fire, explosion, structural  failure, flooding or cargo shifting, or an incident resulting in failure  or breakdown of steering gear, propulsion, electrical generating system,  or essential shipborne navigational aids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>,  that includes all the data elements required in Resolution A.851(20) and  contains information to be provided in the initial and follow-up  notifications. The official number of the vessel and current conditions  of the vessel are to be included. In addition, the initial notification  should include as much of the information on the form as possible, and  supplemental information, as appropriate. However, the initial  notification must not be delayed pending collection of all information.  Copies of the form must be placed at the location(s) on the ship from  which notification may be made.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC94.020     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC94.021</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whom to contact. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> This section of the plan must make  reference to the appendices listing coastal state contacts, port  contacts, and ship interest contacts. In order to expedite response and  minimize damage from a pollution incident, it is essential that  appropriate coastal States should be notified without delay. This  process begins with the initial report required by article 8 and  Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For actual or probable discharges of oil, or oily mixtures the  reports must comply with the procedures described in MARPOL Protocol I.  The reports shall be directed to either the nearest Captain of the Port  (COTP) or to the National Response Center (NRC), toll free telephone  number: 800-424-8802, direct telephone: 202-267-2675, or Fax: 202-267- 1322.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For Antarctica, in addition to compliance with paragraph  (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, reports shall also be directed to any  Antarctic station that may be affected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The plan must clearly specify who will be responsible for  informing the necessary parties from the coastal State contacts, the  port contacts, and the ship interest contacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Steps to control a discharge. This section of the plan must  contain a discussion of procedures to address the following scenarios:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Operational spills: The plan must outline procedures for safe  removal of oil spilled and contained on deck. The plan must also provide  guidance to ensure proper disposal of recovered oil and cleanup  materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Spills resulting from casualties: Casualties should be treated  in the plan as a separate section. The plan should include various  checklists or other means that will ensure the master considers all  appropriate factors when addressing the specific casualty   (Reference is made here to the International Safety Management (ISM)  Code, Section 8). These checklists must be tailored to the specific ship  and to the specific product or product types. In addition to the  checklists, specific personnel assignments for anticipated tasks must be  identified. Reference to existing fire control plans and muster lists is  sufficient to identify personnel responsibilities. The following are  examples of casualties that must be considered--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Grounding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fire or explosion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Collision/Allision;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hull failure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Excessive list;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Containment system failure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Submerged/Foundered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Wrecked/Stranded; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Hazardous vapor release.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In addition to the checklist and personnel duty assignments  required by paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the plan must  include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Priority actions to ensure the safety of personnel and the ship,  assess the damage to the ship, and take appropriate further action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Stability and strength considerations: The plan should provide  the master with detailed guidance to ensure that great care in casualty  response must be taken to consider stability and strength when taking  actions to mitigate the spillage of oil or to free the vessel if  aground. Information for making damage stability and longitudinal  strength assessments, or contacting classification societies to acquire  such information, should be included. Where appropriate, the plan should  provide a list of information for making damage stability and damage  longitudinal strength assessments. The damage stability information for  oil tankers and offshore oil barges in 33 CFR 155.240 is required to be  provided in the SOPEP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Lightening procedures to be followed in cases of extensive  structural damage: The plan must contain information on procedures to be  followed for ship-to-ship transfer of cargo. Reference may be made in  the plan to existing company guides. A copy of such company procedures  for ship-to-ship transfer operations must be kept in the plan. The plan  must address the coordination of this activity with the coastal or port  state, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Mitigating activities: The spill mitigation requirements of 33  CFR 155.1035(c) must be met for tankships, the requirements of 33 CFR  155.1040(c) must be met for unmanned vessels, and the requirements of 33  CFR 155.5035(c) must be met for nontank vessels. Additionally, the  following personnel safety mitigation strategies must be addressed for  all personnel involved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assessment and monitoring activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personnel protection issues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Protective equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Threats to health and safety;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Containment and other response techniques;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Isolation procedures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Decontamination of personnel; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Disposal of removed oil and clean-up materials; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Drawings and ship-specific details: Supporting plans, drawings,  and ship-specific details such as a layout of a general arrangement  plan, midship section, lines or tables of offsets, and tank tables must  be included with the plan. The plan must show where current cargo,  bunker or ballast information, including quantities and specifications,  is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> National and Local Coordination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This section of the plan  must contain information to assist the master in initiating action by  the coastal State, local government, or other involved parties. This  information must include guidance to assist the master with organizing a  response to the incident, should a response not be organized by the  shore authorities. Detailed information for specific areas may be  included as appendices to the plan. See 33 CFR 151.26(b)(2) (Preamble)  regarding a ship owner's responsibility to comply with individual state  requirements for oil spill response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For Antarctica, a vessel owner or operator must include a plan  for prompt and effective response action to such emergencies as might  arise in the performance of its vessel's activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To comply with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, an agency  of the United States government may   promulgate a directive providing for prompt and effective response by  the agency's public vessels operating in Antarctica.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Appendices. Appendices must include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Twenty-four hour contact information and alternates to the  designated contacts.
