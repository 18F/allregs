This trial period will afford residents ample notice of  the effects the checkmetering system will have on their individual  utility charges and also afford a test period for the adequacy of the  utility allowances established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During and after the transition period, PHAs shall advise and  assist residents with high utility consumption on methods for reducing  their usage. This advice and assistance may include counseling,  installation of new energy conserving equipment or appliances, and  corrective maintenance.</p>
