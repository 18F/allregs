                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to owners and operators controlling air  emissions from an oil-water or organic-water separator using a fixed  roof and venting the vapor headspace underneath the fixed roof through a  closed-vent system to a control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The separator shall be covered by a fixed roof and vented  directly through a closed-vent system to a control device in accordance  with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be designed to form  a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of the liquid in the  separator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each opening in the fixed roof not vented to the control device  shall be equipped with a closure device. If the pressure in the vapor  headspace underneath the fixed roof is less than atmospheric pressure  when the control device is operating, the closure devices shall be  designed to operate such that when the closure device is secured in the  closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or other open  spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the cover  opening and the closure device. If the pressure in the vapor headspace  underneath the fixed roof is equal to or greater than atmospheric  pressure when the control device is operating, the closure device shall  be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions, as  determined using the procedure specified in Sec.  63.1046(a) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable  materials that will minimize exposure of the regulated-material to the  atmosphere, to the extent practical, and will maintain the integrity of  the equipment throughout its intended service life. Factors to be  considered when selecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof  and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability; the  effects of any contact with the liquid or its vapors managed in the  separator; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and  sunlight; and the operating practices used for the separator on which  the fixed roof is installed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and  operated in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  63.693 in 40 CFR  part 63, subpart DD--National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air  Pollutants from Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever a regulated-material is in the separator, the fixed  roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the closed  position and the vapor headspace underneath the fixed roof vented to the  control device except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Venting to the control device is not required, and opening of  closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the following  times:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To provide access to the separator for performing routine  inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal  operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a  worker needs to open a port to sample liquid in the separator, or when a  worker needs to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following  completion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure  the closure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as  applicable, to the separator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To remove accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom  of separator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Opening of a safety device, as defined in Sec.  63.1041 of this  subpart, is allowed at any time conditions require it to do so to avoid  an unsafe condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator shall inspect and monitor the air emission  control equipment in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec.   63.1047(c) of this subpart.</p>
