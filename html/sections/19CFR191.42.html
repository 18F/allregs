                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Return to Customs custody. The claimant must return the merchandise to Customs custody within 3 years after the date the merchandise was originally released from Customs custody. Drawback will be denied on merchandise returned to Customs custody after the statutory 3-year time period

or exported or destroyed without return to Customs custody.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required documentation. The claimant shall submit documentation to the drawback office as part of the drawback claim to establish that the merchandise did not conform to sample or specification, was shipped without the consent of the consignee, or was defective as of the time of importation. If the claimant was not the importer, the claimant must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit a statement signed by the importer and every other person, other than the ultimate purchaser, that owned the goods that no other claim for drawback was made on the goods by any other person; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certify that records are available to support the statement required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice. A notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise which may be the subject of a rejected merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)) must be provided to the Customs Service to give Customs the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant, or the exporter (for destruction, see Sec. 191.44), must file at the port of intended redelivery to Customs custody a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on Customs Form 7553 at least 5 working days prior to the date of intended return to Customs custody. Waiver of prior notice for exportations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j) (see Sec. 191.91 of this part) is inapplicable to exportations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required Information. The notice shall provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and e-mail address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Decision to waive examination. Within two (2) working days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback (see paragraph (c) of this section), Customs will notify, in writing, the party designated on the Notice of Customs decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, or to waive examination. If Customs timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise (see paragraph (f) of this section), but the merchandise is exported or destroyed without having been presented to Customs for such examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, shall be denied. If Customs notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by Customs to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported or destroyed without delay and shall be deemed to have been returned to Customs custody.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Time and place of examination. If Customs gives timely notice of its decision to examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, the merchandise to be examined shall be promptly presented to Customs. Customs shall examine the merchandise within five (5) working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported or destroyed without examination if Customs fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to Customs, and in such case the merchandise shall be deemed to have been returned to Customs custody. If the examination is completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation or destruction, the merchandise shall be transported in-bond to the port of exportation or destruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Extent of examination. The appropriate Customs office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine, to the extent determined to be necessary, the items exported or destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Drawback claim. When filing the drawback claim, the drawback claimant must correctly calculate the amount of drawback due (see Sec. 191.51(b) of this part). The procedures for restructuring a claim (see Sec. 191.53 of this part) shall apply to rejected merchandise drawback if the claimant has an ongoing export program which qualifies for this type of drawback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exportation. The claimant shall export the merchandise and shall provide documentary evidence of exportation

(see subpart G of this part). The claimant may establish exportation by mail as set out in Sec. 191.74 of this part.
