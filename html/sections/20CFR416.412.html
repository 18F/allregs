For the period January 1, through December 31, 1994, the rate payable,  as increased by the 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment, was $8,028  per year ($669 per month). The monthly rate is reduced by the amount of  the couple's income which is not excluded pursuant to subpart K of this  part.  [61 FR 10278, Mar. 13, 1996]</p>
