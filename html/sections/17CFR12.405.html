The application shall show to the satisfaction of the Commission that the additional evidence is material, and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing. The Commission may receive the additional evidence or may remand the proceeding to the Judgment Officer or Administrative Law Judge to receive the additional evidence.</p>
