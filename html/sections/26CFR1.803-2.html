                            <p class="depth0">For the purpose of determining ``required interest'' for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, but before January 1, 1955, and ending after August 16, 1954, certain reserves computed on a preliminary term method are to be adjusted by increasing such reserves by 7 percent. The reserves to be thus adjusted are reserves computed on preliminary term methods, such as the Illinois Standard, or the Select and Ultimate methods. Only reserves on policies in the modification period are to be so adjusted. Where reserves under a preliminary term method are the same as on the level premium method, and in the case of reserves for extended or paid-up insurance, no adjustment is to be made. The reserves are thus adjusted, and the rate of interest on which they are computed, should be reported in Schedule A, Form 1120L.</p>
