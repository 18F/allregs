The Administrator may  require, before taking further action thereof, that notice of the  petition be given to affected employees in such manner as he shall  determine to be appropriate to afford them an opportunity to submit any  facts or reasons supporting or opposing the finding prayed for in the  petition. If the Administrator determines that the petition fails to  satisfy any of the requirements of this part, he shall deny the request  for a finding or, in his discretion, advise petitioners that further  consideration will be given to the submission if the deficiencies are  remedied within a specified time. No further consideration will be  given, however, to a request for a finding if the Administrator  determines that the factual situation as described in the petition is  not one in which authority to make the finding is provided by section  13(b)(11) and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(11)</em> of  the Act and this part, the general purpose and effect with respect to  drivers or drivers' helpers making local deliveries, who are employed  pursuant to its provisions on the basis of trip rates or other delivery  payment plan, of reducing the hours worked by such employees to, or  below, the maximum workweek applicable to them under section 7(a) of the  Act, the Administrator will make an appropriate finding to this effect,  and notify the petitioner; otherwise the request for such a finding will  be denied.</p>
