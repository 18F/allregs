                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of the regulations under section 6421, unless otherwise expressly indicated--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gasoline. The term ``gasoline'' has the same meaning given to such term by section 4082(b) and regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified business use. (1) The term ``qualified business use'' means any use by a person in a trade or business of the person or in an activity of the person described in section 212 (relating to production of income) otherwise than as a fuel in a highway vehicle--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``qualified business use'' means any use by a person in a trade or business of the person or in an activity of the person described in section 212 (relating to production of income) otherwise than as a fuel in a highway vehicle--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That at the time of the use is registered, or is required to be registered, for highway use under the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That, in the case of a highway vehicles owned by the United States, is used on the highway.


The term ``qualified business use'' does not include any use in a motorboat, other than a vessel used in the fisheries or whaling business. See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of ``highway vehicle.'' See paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of ``highway.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any highway vehicle operated under a dealer's tag, license, or permit will be considered to be registered. A highway vehicle is not considered to be ``registered'' solely because there has been issued a special permit for operation of the vehicle at particular times and under specified conditions. However, a highway vehicle that is required to be registered and that is also issued a special permit for operation of the vehicle under specified conditions, such as carrying an oversize load, is still considered to be ``registered.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonbusiness, off-highway use of gasoline by such vehicles and equipment as minibikes, snowmobiles, power lawn mowers, chain saws, and other yard equipment does not qualify as gasoline used a qualified business use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples of gasoline used in a qualified business use include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) in stationary engines to operate pumps, generators, compressors, and power saws;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) for cleaning purposes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Gasoline used (in a trade or business or for the production of income) in forklift trucks, bulldozers, and earthmovers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Gasoline used by a nonhighway vehicle in connection with the trade or business of construction, mining or logging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Illustration. The application of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example. M Corporation, a logging company, files its income tax return on the basis of the calendar year. During 1982, the company used 20,000 gallons of gasoline in its logging business. Of this amount, 12,000 gallons were used as fuel in registered highway vehicles which were operated both on the public highways and on the company's private roads. Of the remaining 8,000 gallons, 6,000 were used in nonhighway vehicles, such as tractors and bulldozers, and 2,000 gallons were used in highway vehicles, such as heavy trucks which, at the time of use, were neither registered nor required to be registered under state law for highway use by reason of being operated entirely on the company's property. As the ultimate purchaser, M may take a credit on its income tax return for 1982 under this section in respect of the 6,000 gallons used in the nonhighway vehicles and the 2,000 gallons used in the unregistered highway vehicles. However, no credit may be allowed with respect to the 12,000 gallons used in the registered highway vehicles even though a portion of this gasoline was used in operating the vehicles on the company's own property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Highway vehicle. The term ``highway vehicle'' has the same meaning assigned to this term under Sec. 48.4061(a)-1(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Highway. The term ``highway'' includes any road, whether a Federal highway, State highway, city street, or otherwise, in the United States which is not a private roadway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Noncommercial aviation. The term ``non-commercial aviation'' has the same meaning given to such term by section 4041(c)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calendar quarter. The term ``calendar quarter'' means a period of three calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Taxable year. The ``taxable year'' of a governmental unit or tax-exempt organization described in Sec. 48.6421-1(c) or Sec. 48.6421-2(c) is the calendar or fiscal year on the basis of which it regularly keeps its books. The ``taxable year'' of persons subject to income tax shall have the meaning it has under section 7701(a)(23).
