                                Sec. 230.60  General evaluation of dredged or fill material.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of these evaluation procedures and the chemical and  biological testing sequence outlined in Sec. 230.61 is to provide  information to reach the determinations required by Sec. 230.11. Where  the results of prior evaluations, chemical and biological tests,  scientific research, and experience can provide information helpful in  making a determination, these should be used. Such prior results may  make new testing unnecessary. The information used shall be documented.  Where the same information applies to more than one determination, it  may be docu mented once and referenced in later deter minations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the evaluation under paragraph (b) indicates the dredged or  fill material is not a carrier of contaminants, then the required  determinations pertaining to the presence and effects of contaminants  can be made without testing. Dredged or fill material is most likely to  be free from chemical, biological, or other pollutants where it is  composed primarily of sand, gravel, or other naturally occurring inert  material. Dredged material so composed is generally found in areas of  high current or wave energy such as streams with large bed loads or  coastal areas with shifting bars and channels. However, when such  material is discolored or contains other indications that contaminants  may be present, further inquiry should be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The extraction site shall be examined in order to assess whether  it is sufficiently removed from sources of pollution to provide  reasonable assurance that the proposed discharge material is not a  carrier of contaminants.   Factors to be considered include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Potential routes of contaminants or contaminated sediments to  the extraction site, based on hydrographic or other maps, aerial  photography, or other materials that show watercourses, surface relief,  proximity to tidal movement, private and public roads, location of  buildings, municipal and industrial areas, and agricultural or forest  lands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pertinent results from tests previously carried out on the  material at the extraction site, or carried out on similar material for  other permitted projects in the vicinity. Materials shall be considered  similar if the sources of contamination, the physical configuration of  the sites and the sediment composition of the materials are comparable,  in light of water circulation and stratification, sediment accumulation  and general sediment characteristics. Tests from other sites may be  relied on only if no changes have occurred at the extraction sites to  render the results irrelevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any potential for significant introduction of persistent  pesticides from land runoff or percolation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any records of spills or disposal of petroleum products or  substances designated as hazardous under section 311 of the Clean Water  Act (See 40 CFR part 116);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information in Federal, State and local records indicating  significant introduction of pollutants from industries, municipalities,  or other sources, including types and amounts of waste materials  discharged along the potential routes of contaminants to the extraction  site; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any possibility of the presence of substantial natural deposits  of minerals or other substances which could be released to the aquatic  environment in harmful quantities by man-induced discharge activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To reach the determinations in Sec. 230.11 involving potential  effects of the discharge on the characteristics of the disposal site,  the narrative guidance in subparts C through F shall be used along with  the general evaluation procedure in Sec. 230.60 and, if necessary, the  chemical and biological testing sequence in Sec. 230.61. Where the  discharge site is adjacent to the extraction site and subject to the  same sources of contaminants, and materials at the two sites are  substantially similar, the fact that the material to be discharged may  be a carrier of contaminants is not likely to result in degradation of  the disposal site. In such circumstances, when dissolved material and  suspended particulates can be controlled to prevent carrying pollutants  to less contaminated areas, testing will not be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Even if the Sec. 230.60(b) evaluation (previous tests, the  presence of polluting industries and information about their discharge  or runoff into waters of the U.S., bioinventories, etc.) leads to the  conclusion that there is a high probability that the material proposed  for discharge is a carrier of contaminants, testing may not be necessary  if constraints are available to reduce contamination to acceptable  levels within the disposal site and to prevent contaminants from being  transported beyond the boundaries of the disposal site, if such  constraints are acceptable to the permitting authority and the Regional  Administrator, and if the potential discharger is willing and able to  implement such constraints. However, even if tests are not performed,  the permitting authority must still determine the probable impact of the  operation on the receiving aquatic ecosystem. Any decision not to test  must be explained in the determinations made under Sec. 230.11.</p>
