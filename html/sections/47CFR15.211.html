Particular attention shall be paid to the emissions from any opening in the structure to the outside environment. When measurements are made from the openings, the distances shown in Sec. 15.209 refer to the distance from the plane of reference which fits the entire perimeter of each above ground opening.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The conducted limits in Sec. 15.207 apply to the radiofrequency voltage on the public utility power lines outside of the tunnel.</p>
