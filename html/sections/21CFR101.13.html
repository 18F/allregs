If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A ``substitute'' food is one that may be used interchangeably with another food that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to,

the use of the food, the food may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., ``not recommended for frying'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by Sec. 101.105(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch, unless the package complies with Sec. 101.2(c)(5), in which case the disclaimer may be in type of not less than one thirty-second of an inch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Because the use of a ``free'' or ``low'' claim before the name of a food implies that the food differs from other foods of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only foods that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the food, remove the nutrient from the food, or not include the nutrient in the food, may bear such a claim (e.g., ``low sodium potato chips'').</p><p

low in a nutrient when the food has not been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the food inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all foods of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., ``corn oil, a sodium-free food'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A nutrient

This reasonable basis may derive from recognized data bases for raw and processed foods, recipes, and other means to compute nutrient levels in the foods or meals and may be used provided reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the method of preparation adheres to the factors on which the reasonable basis was determined (e.g., types and amounts of ingredients, cooking temperatures, etc.). Firms making claims on foods based on this reasonable basis criterion are required to provide to appropriate regulatory officials on request the specific information on which their determination is based and reasonable assurance of operational adherence to the preparation methods or other basis for the claim; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A term or symbol that may in some contexts constitute a claim under this section may be used, provided that the use of the term or symbol does not characterize the level of a nutrient, and a statement that clearly explains the basis for the use of the term or symbol is prominently displayed and does not characterize the level of a nutrient. For example, a term such as ``lite fare'' followed by an asterisk referring to a note that makes clear that in this restaurant ``lite fare'' means smaller portion sizes than normal; or an item bearing a symbol referring to a note that makes clear that this item meets the criteria for the dietary guidance established by a recognized dietary authority would not be considered a nutrient content claim under Sec. 101.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Nutrient content claims that were part of the common or usual names of

foods that were subject to a standard of identity on November 8, 1990, are not subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section or to definitions in subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Petitions requesting approval of such a claim may be submitted under Sec. 101.69(o).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term fluoridated, fluoride added or with added fluoride may be used on the label or in labeling of bottled water that contains added fluoride.
