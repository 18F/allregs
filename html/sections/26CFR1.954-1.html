                                Sec. 1.954-1  Foreign base company income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and scope. Section 954 and Secs. 1.954-1  and 1.954-2 provide rules for computing the foreign base company income  of a controlled foreign corporation. Foreign base company income is  included in the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation  under the rules of section 952. Subpart F income is included in the  gross income of a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign  corporation under the rules of section 951 and thus is subject to  current taxation under section 1, 11 or 55 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The determination of whether a foreign corporation is a controlled  foreign corporation, the subpart F income of which is included currently  in the gross income of its United States shareholders, is made under the  rules of section 957.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gross foreign base company income. The gross foreign base  company income of a controlled foreign corporation consists of the  following categories of gross income (determined after the application  of section 952(b))--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Foreign personal holding company income, as defined in section  954(c);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign base company sales income, as defined in section  954(d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign base company services income, as defined in section  954(e);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Foreign base company shipping income, as defined in section  954(f); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Foreign base company oil related income, as defined in section  954(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjusted gross foreign base company income. The term adjusted  gross foreign base company income means the gross foreign base company  income of a controlled foreign corporation as adjusted by the de minimis  and full inclusion rules of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Net foreign base company income. The term net foreign base  company income means the adjusted gross foreign base company income of a  controlled foreign corporation reduced so as to take account of  deductions (including taxes) properly allocable or apportionable to such  income under the rules of section 954(b)(5) and paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Adjusted net foreign base company income. The term adjusted net  foreign base company income means the net foreign base company income of  a controlled foreign corporation reduced, first, by any items of net  foreign base company income excluded from subpart F income pursuant to  section 952(c) and, second, by any items excluded from subpart F income  pursuant to the high tax exception of section 954(b). See paragraph  (d)(4)(ii) of this section. The term foreign base company income as used  in the Internal Revenue Code and elsewhere in the Income Tax Regulations  means adjusted net foreign base company income, unless otherwise  provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Insurance income. The term gross insurance income includes all  gross income taken into account in determining insurance income under  section 953. The term adjusted gross insurance income means gross  insurance income as adjusted by the de minimis and full inclusion rules  of paragraph (b) of this section. The term net insurance income means  adjusted gross insurance income reduced under section 953 so as to take  into account deductions (including taxes) properly allocable or  apportionable to such income. The term adjusted net insurance income  means net insurance income reduced by any items of net insurance income  that are excluded from subpart F income pursuant to section 952(b) or  pursuant to the high tax exception of section 954(b). The term insurance  income as used in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code and in the  regulations under that subpart means adjusted net insurance income,  unless otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Additional items of adjusted net foreign base company income or  adjusted net insurance income by reason of section 952(c). Earnings and  profits of the controlled foreign corporation that are recharacterized  as foreign base company income or insurance income under section 952(c)  are items of adjusted net foreign base company income or adjusted net  insurance income, respectively. Amounts subject to recharacterization  under section 952(c) are determined after adjusted net foreign base  company income and adjusted net insurance income are otherwise  determined under subpart F and are not again subject to any exceptions  or special rules that would affect the amount of subpart F income. Thus,  for example, items of gross foreign base company income or gross  insurance income that are excluded from adjusted gross foreign base  company income or adjusted gross insurance income because the de minimis  test is met are subject to recharacterization under section 952(c).  Further, the de minimis and full inclusion tests of paragraph (b) of  this section, and the high tax exception of paragraph (d) of this  section, for example, do not apply to such amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(C)</em> of this section, adjusted gross foreign base  company income and adjusted gross insurance income are equal to zero if  the sum of the gross foreign base company income and the gross insurance  income of a controlled foreign corporation is less than the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 5 percent of gross income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $1,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Currency translation. Controlled foreign corporations having a  functional currency other than the United States dollar shall translate  the $1,000,000 threshold using the exchange rate provided under section  989(b)(3) for amounts included in income under section 951(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Coordination with sections 864(d) and 881(c). Adjusted gross  foreign base company income or adjusted gross insurance income of a  controlled foreign corporation always includes income from trade or  service receivables described in section 864(d)(1) or (6), and portfolio  interest described in section 881(c), even if the de minimis test of  this paragraph (b)(1)(i) is otherwise satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Seventy percent full inclusion test. Except as provided in  section 953, adjusted gross foreign base company income consists of all  gross income of the controlled foreign corporation other than gross  insurance income and amounts described in section 952(b), and adjusted  gross insurance income consists of all gross insurance income other than  amounts described in section 952(b), if the sum of the gross foreign  base company income and the gross insurance income for the taxable year  exceeds 70 percent of gross income. See paragraph (d)(6) of this  section, under which certain items of full inclusion foreign base  company income may nevertheless be excluded from subpart F income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Character of gross income included in adjusted gross foreign  base company income. The gross income included in the adjusted gross  foreign base company income of a controlled foreign   corporation generally retains its character as foreign personal holding  company income, foreign base company sales income, foreign base company  services income, foreign base company shipping income, or foreign base  company oil related income. However, gross income included in adjusted  gross foreign base company income because the full inclusion test of  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is met is termed full inclusion  foreign base company income, and constitutes a separate category of  adjusted gross foreign base company income for purposes of allocating  and apportioning deductions under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with section 952(c). Income that is included in  subpart F income because the full inclusion test of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)  of this section is met does not reduce amounts that, under section  952(c), are subject to recharacterization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Anti-abuse rule--(i) In general. For purposes of applying the de  minimis test of paragraph (b)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section, the income of two  or more controlled foreign corporations shall be aggregated and treated  as the income of a single corporation if a principal purpose for  separately organizing, acquiring, or maintaining such multiple  corporations is to prevent income from being treated as foreign base  company income or insurance income under the de minimis test. A purpose  may be a principal purpose even though it is outweighed by other  purposes (taken together or separately).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em>, (B), or (C) of this section. This presumption  may be rebutted by proof to the contrary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> may be rebutted by proof that the activities carried on by  each controlled foreign corporation would constitute a separate branch  under the principles of Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g)(2) if carried on directly by  a United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The controlled foreign corporations carry on a business,  financial operation, or venture as partners directly or indirectly in a  partnership (as defined in section 7701(a)(2) and Sec. 301.7701-3 of  this chapter) that is a related person (as defined in paragraph  (b)(4)(iii) of this section) with respect to each such controlled  foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The activities carried on by the controlled foreign corporations  would constitute a single branch operation under Sec. 1.367(a)-6T(g)(2)  if carried on directly by a United States person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Related persons. For purposes of this paragraph (b), two or  more persons are related persons if they are in a relationship described  in section 267(b). In determining for purposes of this paragraph (b)  whether two or more corporations are members of the same controlled  group under section 267(b)(3), a person is considered to own stock owned  directly by such person, stock owned with the application of section  1563(e)(1), and stock owned with the application of section 267(c). In  determining for purposes of this paragraph (b) whether a corporation is  related to a partnership under section 267(b)(10), a person is  considered to own the partnership interest owned directly by such person  and the partnership interest owned with the application of section  267(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of  this paragraph (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> USP is the sole United States shareholder of three  controlled foreign corporations: CFC1, CFC2 and CFC3. The   three controlled foreign corporations all have the same taxable year.  The three controlled foreign corporations are partners in FP, a foreign  entity classified as a partnership under section 7701(a)(2) and  Sec. 301.7701-3 of the regulations. For their current taxable years,  each of the controlled foreign corporations derives all of its income  other than foreign base company income from activities conducted through  FP, and its foreign base company income from activities conducted both  jointly through FP and separately without FP. Based on the facts in the  table below, the foreign base company income derived by each controlled  foreign corporation for its current taxable year, including income  derived from FP, is less than five percent of the gross income of each  controlled foreign corporation and is less than $1,000,000:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">CFC1            CFC2            CFC3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross income....................................................      $4,000,000      $8,000,000     $12,000,000 Five percent of gross income....................................         200,000         400,000         600,000 Foreign base company income.....................................         199,000         398,000         597,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Thus, without the application of the anti-abuse rule of this  paragraph (b)(4), each controlled foreign corporation would be treated  as having no foreign base company income after the application of the de  minimis test of section 954(b)(3)(A) and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section is successfully rebutted. The sum of the  foreign base company income of the controlled foreign corporations is  $1,194,000. Thus, the amount of gross foreign base company income of  each controlled foreign corporation will not be reduced by reason of the  de minimis rule of section 954(b)(3)(A) and this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. The principles of Sec. 1.904- 5(k) shall apply where payments are made between controlled foreign  corporations that are related persons (within the meaning of section  954(d)(3)). Consistent with these principles, only payments described in  Sec. 1.954-2(b)(4)(ii)(B)(2) may be offset as provided in Sec. 1.904- 5(k)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deductions against gross foreign base company income. The net  foreign base company income of a controlled foreign corporation is  computed first by taking into account deductions in the following  manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> First, the gross amount of each item of income described in  paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section is determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Second, any expenses definitely related to less than all gross  income as a class shall be allocated and apportioned under the  principles of sections 861, 864 and 904(d) to the gross income described  in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Third, foreign personal holding company income that is passive  within the meaning of section 904 (determined before the application of  the high-taxed income rule of Sec. 1.904-4(c)) is reduced by related  person interest expense allocable to passive income under Sec. 1.904- 5(c)(2); such interest must be further allocated and apportioned to  items described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Fourth, the amount of each item of income described in paragraph  (c)(1)(iii) of this section is reduced by other expenses allocable and  apportionable to such income under the principles of sections 861, 864  and 904(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Losses reduce subpart F income by operation of earnings and  profits limitation. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.954-2(g)(4),  if after applying the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the  amount remaining in any category of foreign base company income or  foreign personal holding company income is less than zero, the loss in  that category may not reduce any other category of foreign base company  income or foreign personal holding company income except by operation of  the earnings and profits limitation of section 952(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Items of income--(A) Income other than passive foreign  personal holding company income. A single item of income (other than  foreign personal holding company income that is passive) is   the aggregate amount from all transactions that falls within a single  separate category (as defined in Sec. 1.904-5(a)(1)), and either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Falls within a single category of foreign personal holding  company income as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividends, interest, rents, royalties and annuities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gain from certain property transactions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gain from commodities transactions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Foreign currency gain; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Income equivalent to interest; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Falls within a single category of foreign base company income,  other than foreign personal holding company income, as--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Foreign base company sales income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign base company services income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Foreign base company shipping income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Foreign base company oil related income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Full inclusion foreign base company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Passive foreign personal holding company income. A single item  of foreign personal holding company income that is passive is an amount  of income that falls within a single group of passive income under the  grouping rules of Sec. 1.904-4(c)(3), (4) and (5) and a single category  of foreign personal holding company income described in paragraphs  (c)(1)(iii)(A)(1) (i) through (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computation of net foreign base company income derived from same  country insurance income. Deductions relating to foreign base company  income attributable to the issuing (or reinsuring) of any insurance or  annuity contract in connection with risks located in the country under  the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or  organized shall be allocated and apportioned in accordance with the  rules set forth in section 953.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>. Any item of income that is  foreign base company oil related income, as defined in section 954(g),  or portfolio interest, as described in section 881(c), does not qualify  for the high tax exception. See paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iii)</em> of this section  for the definition of the term item of income. For rules concerning the  treatment for foreign tax credit purposes of amounts excluded from  subpart F under section 954(b)(4), see Sec. 1.904-4(c). A net item of  income qualifies for the high tax exception only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An election is made under section 954(b)(4) and paragraph (d)(5)  of this section to exclude the income from the computation of subpart F  income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It is established that the net item of income was subject to  foreign income taxes imposed by a foreign country or countries at an  effective rate that is greater than 90 percent of the maximum rate of  tax specified in section 11 for the taxable year of the controlled  foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective rate at which taxes are imposed. The effective rate  with respect to a net item of income shall be determined separately for  each controlled foreign corporation in a chain of corporations through  which a distribution is made. The effective rate at which taxes are  imposed on a net item of income is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The United States dollar amount of foreign income taxes paid or  accrued (or deemed paid or accrued) with respect to the net item of  income, determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; divided by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The United States dollar amount of the net item of foreign base  company income or insurance income, described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)  of this section, increased by the amount of foreign income taxes  referred to in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxes paid or accrued with respect to an item of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Income other than passive foreign personal holding company income. The  amount of foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to a net  item of income (other than an item of foreign personal holding company  income that is passive)   for purposes of section 954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d) is the United  States dollar amount of foreign income taxes that would be deemed paid  under section 960 with respect to that item if that item were included  in the gross income of a United States shareholder under section  951(a)(1)(A) (determined, in the case of a United States shareholder  that is an individual, as if an election under section 962 has been  made, whether or not such election is actually made). For this purpose,  in accordance with the regulations under section 960, the amounts that  would be deemed paid under section 960 shall be determined separately  with respect to each controlled foreign corporation and without regard  to the limitation applicable under section 904(a). The amount of foreign  income taxes paid or accrued with respect to a net item of income,  determined in the manner provided in this paragraph (d), will not be  affected by a subsequent reduction in foreign income taxes attributable  to a distribution to shareholders of all or part of such income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Passive foreign personal holding company income. The amount of  income taxes paid or accrued with respect to a net item of foreign  personal holding company income that is passive for purposes of section  954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d) is the United States dollar amount of  foreign income taxes that would be deemed paid under section 960 and  that would be taken into account for purposes applying the provisions of  Sec. 1.904-4(c) with respect to that net item of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consistency rule. An election to exclude  income from the computation of subpart F income for a taxable year must  be made consistently with respect to all items of passive foreign  personal holding company income eligible to be excluded for the taxable  year. Thus, high-taxed passive foreign personal holding company income  of a controlled foreign corporation must either be excluded in its  entirety, or remain subject to subpart F in its entirety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Coordination with earnings and profits limitation. If the  amount of income included in subpart F income for the taxable year is  reduced by the earnings and profits limitation of section 952(c)(1), the  amount of income that is a net item of income, within the meaning of  paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, is determined after the  application of the rules of section 952(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. All of the taxes referred to in  the following example are foreign income taxes. For simplicity, this  example assumes that the amount of taxes that are taken into account as  a deduction under section 954(b)(5) and the amount of the gross-up  required under sections 960 and 78 are equal. Therefore, this example  does not separately illustrate the deduction for taxes and gross-up.</p><p class="depth0">Example. During its 1995 taxable year, CFC, a controlled foreign  corporation, earns royalty income, net of taxes, of $100 that is foreign  personal holding company income. CFC has no expenses associated with  this royalty income. CFC pays $50 of foreign income taxes with respect  to the royalty income. For 1995, CFC has current earnings and profits of  $50. CFC's subpart F income, as determined prior to the application of  this paragraph (d), exceeds its current earnings and profits. Thus,  under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, the amount of CFC's only net  item of income, the royalty income, will be limited to $50. The  remaining $50 will be subject to recharacterization in a subsequent  taxable year under section 952(c)(2). Because the amount of foreign  income taxes paid with respect to this net item of income is $50, the  effective rate of tax on the item, for purposes of this paragraph (d),  is 50 percent ($50 of taxes/$50 net item + $50 of taxes). Accordingly,  an election under paragraph (d)(5) of this section may be made to  exclude the item of income from the computation of subpart F income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> is binding on all United States shareholders of the  controlled foreign corporation and must be made--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> By the controlling United States shareholders, as defined in  Sec. 1.964-1(c)(5), by attaching a statement to such effect with their  original or amended income tax returns, and including any additional  information required by applicable administrative pronouncements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In such other manner as may be prescribed in applicable  administrative pronouncements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Coordination of full inclusion and high tax exception rules.  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, full inclusion  foreign base company income will be excluded from subpart F income if  more than 90 percent of the adjusted gross foreign base company income  and adjusted gross insurance company income of a controlled foreign  corporation (determined without regard to the full inclusion test of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is attributable to net amounts  excluded from subpart F income pursuant to an election to have the high  tax exception described in section 954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d)  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. (i) The following examples illustrate the rules of  this paragraph (d). All of the taxes referred to in the following  examples are foreign income taxes. For simplicity, these examples assume  that the amount of taxes that are taken into account as a deduction  under section 954(b)(5) and the amount of the gross-up required under  sections 960 and 78 are equal. Therefore, these examples do not  separately illustrate the deduction for taxes and gross-up. Except as  otherwise stated, these examples assume there are no earnings, deficits,  or foreign income taxes in the post-1986 pools of earnings and profits  or foreign income taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items of income. During its 1995 taxable year,  controlled foreign corporation CFC earns from outside its country of  operation portfolio dividend income of $100 and interest income, net of  taxes, of $100 (consisting of a gross payment of $150 reduced by a  third-country withholding tax of $50). For purposes of illustration,  assume that CFC incurs no expenses. None of the income is taxed in CFC's  country of operation. The dividend income was not subject to third- country withholding taxes. Pursuant to the operation of section 904, the  interest income is high withholding tax interest and the dividend income  is passive income. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of  this section, CFC has two net items of income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $100 of foreign personal holding company (FPHC)/passive income  (the dividends); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $100 of FPHC/high withholding tax income (the interest).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective rates of tax. No foreign tax would be deemed paid  under section 960 with respect to the net item of income described in  paragraph (i)(1) of this Example 1. Therefore, the effective rate of  foreign tax is 0, and the item may not be excluded from subpart F income  under the rules of this paragraph (d). Foreign tax of $50 would be  deemed paid under section 960 with respect to the net item of income  described in paragraph (i)(2) of this Example 1. Therefore, the  effective rate of foreign tax is 33 percent ($50 of creditable taxes  paid, divided by $150, consisting of the net item of foreign base  company income ($100) plus creditable taxes paid thereon ($50)). The  highest rate of tax specified in section 11 for the 1995 taxable year is  35 percent. Accordingly, the net item of income described in paragraph  (i)(2) of this Example 1 may be excluded from subpart F income if an  election under paragraph (d)(5) of this section is made, since it is  subject to foreign tax at an effective rate that is greater than 31.5  percent (90 percent of 35 percent). However, for purposes of section  904(d), it remains high withholding tax interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  CFC's country of operation imposes a tax of $50 with respect to CFC's  dividend income (and thus CFC earns portfolio dividend income, net of  taxes, of only $50). The interest income is still high withholding tax  interest. The dividend income is still passive income (without regard to  the possible applicability of the high tax exception of section  904(d)(2)). Accordingly, CFC has two items of income for purposes of  this paragraph (d)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $50 of FPHC/passive income (net of the $50 foreign tax); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $100 of FPHC/high withholding tax interest income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each item is taxed at an effective rate greater than 31.5  percent. The net item of income described in paragraph (i)(1) of this  Example 2: foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of net item of income  ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. The net item  of income described in paragraph (i)(2) of this Example 2: foreign tax  ($50) divided by sum ($150) of income item ($100) plus creditable tax  thereon ($50) equals 33 percent. Accordingly, an election may be made  under paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude either or both of the  net items of income described in paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this  Example 2 from subpart F income. If no election is made the items would  be included in the subpart F income of CFC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  the $100 of portfolio dividend income is subject to a third-country  withholding tax of $50, and the $150 of interest income is from sources  within CFC's country of operation, is subject to a $10 income tax  therein, and is not subject to a withholding tax. Although the interest  income and the dividend income are both passive income, under paragraph  (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section they constitute separate items of income  pursuant to the application of the   grouping rules of Sec. 1.904-4(c). Accordingly, CFC has two net items of  income for purposes of this paragraph (d)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $50 (net of $50 tax) of FPHC/non-country of operation/greater  than 15 percent withholding tax income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $140 (net of $10 tax) of FPHC/country of operation income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The item described in paragraph (i)(1) of this Example 3 is  taxed at an effective rate greater than 31.5 percent, but Item 2 is not.  The net item of income described in paragraph (i)(1) of this Example 3:  foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of net item of income ($50) plus  creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. The net item of income  described in paragraph (i)(2) of this Example 3: foreign tax ($10)  divided by sum ($150) of net item of income ($140) plus creditable tax  thereon ($10) equals 6.67 percent. Therefore, an election may be made  under paragraph (d)(5) of this section to exclude the net item of income  described in paragraph (i)(1) of this Example 3 but not the net item of  income described in paragraph (i)(2) of this Example 3 from subpart F  income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the  $150 of interest income is subject to an income tax of $50 in CFC's  country of operation. Accordingly, CFC's items of income are the same as  in Example 3, but both items are taxed at an effective rate greater than  31.5 percent. The net item of income described in paragraph (i)(1) of  Example 3: foreign tax ($50) divided by sum ($100) of net item of income  ($50) plus creditable tax thereon ($50) equals 50 percent. The net item  of income described in paragraph (i)(2) of Example 3: foreign tax ($50)  divided by sum ($150) of net item of income ($100) plus creditable tax  thereon ($50) equals 33 percent. Pursuant to the consistency rule of  paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, an election made by CFC's  controlling United States shareholders must exclude from subpart F  income both items of FPHC income under the high tax exception of section  954(b)(4) and this paragraph (d). The election may not be made only with  respect to one item.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that CFC  earns $5 of portfolio dividend income and $150 of interest income. In  addition, CFC earns $45 for performing consulting services within its  country of operation for unrelated persons. CFC's gross foreign base  company income for 1995 of $155 ($150 of gross interest income and $5 of  portfolio dividend income) is greater than 70 percent of its gross  income of $200. Therefore, under the full inclusion test of paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section, CFC's adjusted gross foreign base company  income is $200, and under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $45 of  consulting income is full inclusion foreign base company income. If CFC  elects, under paragraph (d)(5) of this section, to exclude the interest  income from subpart F income pursuant to the high tax exception, the $45  of full inclusion foreign base company income will be excluded from  subpart F income under paragraph (d)(6) of this section because the $150  of gross interest income excluded under the high tax exception is more  than 90 percent of CFC's adjusted gross foreign base company income of  $155.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section is met  and the income is not excluded from subpart F income under section  952(b). Computations in these examples involving the operation of  section 952(c) are included for purposes of illustration only and do not  provide substantive rules concerning the operation of that section. For  simplicity, these examples assume that the amount of taxes that are  taken into account as a deduction under section 954(b)(5) and the amount  of the gross-up required under sections 960 and 78 are equal. Therefore,  these examples do not separately illustrate the deduction for taxes and  gross-up.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gross income. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation,  has gross income of $1000 for the current taxable year. Of that $1000 of  income, $100 is interest income that is included in the definition of  foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1)(A) and  Sec. 1.954-2(b)(1)(ii), is not income from a trade or service receivable  described in section 864(d)(1) or (6), or portfolio interest described  in section 881(c), and is not excluded from foreign personal holding  company income under any provision of section 952(b) or section 954(c).  Another $50 is foreign base company sales income under section 954(d).  The remaining $850 of gross income is not included in the definition of  foreign base company income or insurance income under sections 954 (c),  (d), (e), (f) or (g) or 953, and is foreign source general limitation  income described in section 904(d)(1)(I).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenses. For the current taxable year, CFC has expenses of  $500. This amount includes $8 of interest paid to a related person that  is allocable to foreign personal holding company income under section  904, and $2 of other expense that is directly related to foreign  personal holding company income. Another $20 of expense is directly  related to foreign base company sales. The remaining $470 of expenses is  allocable to general limitation   income that is not foreign base company income or insurance income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Earnings and losses. CFC has earnings and profits for the  current taxable year of $500. In the prior taxable year, CFC had losses  with respect to income other than gross foreign base company income or  gross insurance income. By reason of the limitation provided under  section 952(c)(1)(A), those losses reduced the subpart F income  (consisting entirely of foreign source general limitation income) of CFC  by $600 for the prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Taxes. Foreign income tax of $30 is considered imposed on the  interest income under the rules of section 954(b)(4), this paragraph  (d), and Sec. 1.904-6. Foreign income tax of $14 is considered imposed  on the foreign base company sales income under the rules of section  954(b)(4), paragraph (d) of this section, and Sec. 1.904-6. Foreign  income tax of $177 is considered imposed on the remaining foreign source  general limitation income under the rules of section 954(b)(4), this  paragraph (d), and Sec. 1.904-6. For the taxable year of CFC, the  maximum United States rate of taxation under section 11 is 35 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Conclusion. Based on these facts, if CFC elects to exclude all  items of income subject to a high foreign tax under section 954(b)(4)  and this paragraph (d), it will have $500 of subpart F income as defined  in section 952(a) (consisting entirely of foreign source general  limitation income) determined as follows:  Step 1--Determine gross income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gross income.............................................    $1000 Step 2--Determine gross foreign base company income and gross</p><p class="depth0">insurance income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest income included in gross foreign personal             100</p><p class="depth0">holding company income under section 954(c).................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gross foreign base company sales income under section           50</p><p class="depth0">954(d)......................................................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Total gross foreign base company income and gross              150</p><p class="depth0">insurance income as defined in sections 954 (c), (d), (e),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> and (g) and 953 (line (2) plus line (3))................

For  purposes of section 954, income shall be characterized in accordance  with the substance of the transaction, and not in accordance with the  designation applied by the parties to the transaction. For example, an  amount that is designated as rent by the taxpayer but actually  constitutes income from the sale of property, royalties, or income from  services shall not be characterized as rent but shall be characterized  as income from the sale of property, royalties or income from services,  as the case may be. Local law shall not be controlling in characterizing  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of  this section. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation, in its  business of purchasing personal property and selling it to related  persons outside its country of incorporation, also performs services  outside its country of incorporation with respect to the property it  sells, the sales income will be treated as foreign base company sales  income and the services income will be treated as foreign base company  services income for purposes of these rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Predominant character. The portion of income or gain derived  from a transaction that is included in the computation of foreign  personal holding company income is always separately determinable and  thus must always be segregated from other income and separately  classified under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. However, the portion  of income or gain derived from a transaction that would meet a  particular definitional provision under section 954 or 953 (other than  the definition of foreign personal holding company income) in unusual  circumstances may not be separately determinable. If such portion is not  separately determinable, it must be classified in accordance with the  predominant character of the transaction. For example, if a controlled  foreign corporation engineers, fabricates, and installs a fixed offshore  drilling platform as part of an integrated transaction, and the portion  of income that relates to services is not accounted for separately from  the portion that relates to sales, and is otherwise not separately  determinable, then the classification of income from the transaction  shall be made in accordance with the predominant character of the  arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Coordination of categories of gross foreign base company income  or gross insurance income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The computations of gross  foreign base company income and gross insurance income are limited by  the following rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If income is foreign base company shipping income, pursuant to  section   954(f), it shall not be considered insurance income or income in any  other category of foreign base company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If income is foreign base company oil related income, pursuant  to section 954(g), it shall not be considered insurance income or income  in any other category of foreign base company income, except as provided  in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If income is insurance income, pursuant to section 953, it shall  not be considered income in any category of foreign base company income  except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If income is foreign personal holding company income, pursuant  to section 954(c), it shall not be considered income in any other  category of foreign base company income, other than as provided in  paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A), (B) or (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income excluded from other categories of gross foreign base  company income. Income shall not be excluded from a category of gross  foreign base company income or gross insurance income under this  paragraph (e)(4) by reason of being included in another category of  gross foreign base company income or gross insurance income, if the  income is excluded from that other category by a more specific provision  of section 953 or 954. For example, income derived from a commodity  transaction that is excluded from foreign personal holding company  income under Sec. 1.954-2(f) as income from a qualified active sale may  be included in gross foreign base company income if it also meets the  definition of foreign base company sales income. See Sec. 1.954-2(a)(2)  for the coordination of overlapping categories within the definition of  foreign personal holding company income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definition of related person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Persons related to controlled  foreign corporation. Unless otherwise provided, for purposes of section  954 and Secs. 1.954-1 through 1.954-8 inclusive, the following persons  are considered under section 954(d)(3) to be related persons with  respect to a controlled foreign corporation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individuals. An individual, whether or not a citizen or resident  of the United States, who controls the controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other persons. A foreign or domestic corporation, partnership,  trust or estate that controls or is controlled by the controlled foreign  corporation, or is controlled by the same person or persons that control  the controlled foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Control--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporations. With respect to a corporation,  control means the ownership, directly or indirectly, of stock possessing  more than 50 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock  entitled to vote or of the total value of the stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnerships. With respect to a partnership, control means the  ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent (by value) of  the capital or profits interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trusts and estates. With respect to a trust or estate, control  means the ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent (by  value) of the beneficial interest in the trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Direct or indirect ownership. For purposes of this paragraph  (f), to determine direct or indirect ownership, the principles of  section 958 shall be applied without regard to whether a corporation,  partnership, trust or estate is foreign or domestic or whether or not an  individual is a citizen or resident of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Distributive share of partnership income--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application of  related person and country of organization tests. Unless otherwise  provided, to determine the extent to which a controlled foreign  corporation's distributive share of any item of gross income of a  partnership would have been subpart F income if received by it directly,  under Sec. 1.952-1(g), if a provision of subpart F requires a  determination of whether an entity is a related person, within the  meaning of section 954(d)(3), or whether an activity occurred within or  outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign  corporation is created or organized, this determination shall be made by  reference to such controlled foreign corporation and not by reference to  the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of related person test for sales and purchase  transactions between   a partnership and its controlled foreign corporation partner. For  purposes of determining whether a controlled foreign corporation's  distributive share of any item of gross income of a partnership is  foreign base company sales income under section 954(d)(1) when the item  of income is derived from the sale by the partnership of personal  property purchased by the partnership from (or sold by the partnership  on behalf of) the controlled foreign corporation; or the sale by the  partnership of personal property to (or the purchase of personal  property by the partnership on behalf of) the controlled foreign  corporation (CFC-partnership transaction), the CFC-partnership  transaction will be treated as a transaction with an entity that is a  related person, within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), under paragraph  (g)(1) of this section, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The controlled foreign corporation purchased such personal  property from (or sold it to the partnership on behalf of), or sells  such personal property to (or purchases it from the partnership on  behalf of), a related person with respect to the controlled foreign  corporation (other than the partnership), within the meaning of section  954(d)(3); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The branch rule of section 954(d)(2) applies to treat as  foreign base company sales income the income of the controlled foreign  corporation from selling to the partnership (or a third party) personal  property that the controlled foreign corporation has manufactured, in  the case where the partnership purchases personal property from (or  sells personal property on behalf of) the controlled foreign  corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (g) is illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation organized in  Country A, is an 80-percent partner in Partnership, a partnership  organized in Country A. All of the stock of CFC is owned by USP, a U.S.  corporation. Partnership earns commission income from purchasing Product  O on behalf of USP, from unrelated manufacturers in Country B, for sale  in the United States. To determine whether CFC's distributive share of  Partnership's commission income is foreign base company sales income  under section 954(d), CFC is treated as if it purchased Product O on  behalf of USP. Under section 954(d)(3), USP is a related person with  respect to CFC. Thus, with respect to CFC, the sales income is deemed to  be derived from the purchase of personal property on behalf of a related  person. Because the property purchased is both manufactured and sold for  use outside of Country A, CFC's country of organization, CFC's  distributive share of the sales income is foreign base company sales  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation organized in  Country A, is an 80-percent partner in Partnership, a partnership  organized in Country B. CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation organized  in Country B, owns the remaining 20 percent interest in Partnership.  CFC1 and CFC2 are owned by a common U.S. parent, USP. CFC2 manufactures  Product A in Country B. Partnership earns sales income from purchasing  Product A from CFC2 and selling it to third parties located in Country B  that are not related persons with respect to CFC1 or CFC2. To determine  whether CFC1's distributive share of Partnership's sales income is  foreign base company sales income under section 954(d), CFC1 is treated  as if it purchased Product A from CFC2 and sold it to third parties in  Country B. Under section 954(d)(3), CFC2 is a related person with  respect to CFC1. Thus, with respect to CFC1, the sales income is deemed  to be derived from the purchase of personal property from a related  person. Because the property purchased is both manufactured and sold for  use outside of Country A, CFC1's country of organization, CFC1's  distributive share of the sales income is foreign base company sales  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because Product A is both manufactured and sold for use within  CFC2's country of organization, CFC2's distributive share of  Partnership's sales income is not foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation organized in  Country A, is an 80 percent partner in MJK Partnership, a Country B  partnership. CFC purchased goods from J Corp, a Country C corporation  that is a related person with respect to CFC. CFC sold the goods to MJK  Partnership. In turn, MJK Partnership sold the goods to P Corp, a  Country D corporation that is unrelated to CFC. P Corp sold the goods to  unrelated customers in Country D. The goods were manufactured in Country  C by persons unrelated to J Corp . CFC's distributive share of the  income of MJK Partnership from the sale of goods to P Corp will be  treated as income from the sale of goods purchased from a related person  for purposes of section 954(d)(1) because CFC purchased the goods from J  Corp, a related person. Because the goods were both manufactured and  sold for use outside of Country A, CFC's distributive share of the  income attributable to the sale of the goods is foreign base company  sales income. Further, CFC's income from the sale of the   goods to MJK Partnership will also be foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as Example 3, except that MJK  Partnership purchased the goods from P Corp and sold those goods to CFC.  CFC sold the goods to J Corp. J Corp sold the goods to unrelated  customers in Country C. CFC's distributive share of the income of MJK  Partnership from the sale of the goods by the partnership to itself will  be treated as income from the sale of goods to a related person, for  purposes of section 954(d)(1). Because the goods were both manufactured  and sold for use outside of Country A, CFC's distributive share of  income attributable to the sale of the goods is foreign base company  sales income. Further, CFC's income from the sale of the goods to J Corp  is also foreign base company sales income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (g) applies to taxable years of a  controlled foreign corporation beginning on or after July 23, 2002.
