A tank car removed from hazardous materials service because it failed a test prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section may not be used to transport a hazardous material unless the tank car conforms to all applicable requirements of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each rupture disc must be replaced every 12 months, and the replacement date must be marked on the car near the pressure relief valve information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pressure relief valves and alternate pressure relief valves must be tested every five years. The start-to-discharge pressure and vapor tight pressure requirements for the pressure relief valves must be as specified in Sec. 179.401-1 of this subchapter. The alternate pressure relief device values specified in Sec. 179.401-1 of this subchapter for a DOT-113C120W tank car apply to a DOT-113D120W tank car.
