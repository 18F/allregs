                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you route all process vent emissions and emissions from combustion of process off-gas to one or more stacks and use CEMS on each stack to measure CO2 emissions (except flare stacks), then you must determine process-based GHG emissions in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Otherwise, determine process-based GHG emissions in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). Route all process vent emissions and emissions from stationary combustion units that burn any amount of process off-gas to one or more stacks and determine GHG emissions as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine CO2 emissions from each stack (except flare stacks) according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology requirements in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each stack (except flare stacks) that includes emissions from combustion of petrochemical process off-gas, calculate CH4 and N2O emissions in accordance with subpart C of this part (use Equation C-10 and the ``fuel gas'' emission factors in Table C-2 of subpart C of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each flare, calculate CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions using the methodology specified in Sec. 98.253(b)(1) through (3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Mass balance for each petrochemical process unit. Calculate the emissions of CO2 from each process unit, for each calendar month as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each gaseous and liquid feedstock and product, measure the volume or mass used or produced each calendar month with a flow meter by following the procedures specified in Sec. 98.244(b)(2). Alternatively, for liquids, you may calculate the volume used or collected in each month based on measurements of the liquid level in a storage tank at least once per month (and just prior to each change in direction of the level of the liquid) following the procedures specified in Sec. 98.244(b)(3). Fuels used for combustion purposes are not considered to be feedstocks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each solid feedstock and product, measure the mass used or produced each calendar month by following the procedures specified in Sec. 98.244(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Collect a sample of each feedstock and product at least once per month and determine the carbon content of each sample according to the procedures of Sec. 98.244(b)(4). If multiple valid carbon content measurements are made during the monthly measurement period, average them arithmetically. However, if a particular liquid or solid feedstock is delivered in lots, and if multiple deliveries of the same feedstock are received from the same supply source in a given calendar month, only one representative sample is required. Alternatively, you may use the results of analyses conducted by a feedstock supplier, or product customer, provided the sampling and analysis is conducted at least once per month using any of the procedures specified in Sec. 98.244(b)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you determine that the monthly average concentration of a specific compound in a feedstock or product is greater than 99.5 percent by volume or mass, then as an alternative to the sampling and analysis specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, you may determine carbon content in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the carbon content assuming 100 percent of that feedstock or product is the specific compound.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maintain records of any determination made in accordance with this paragraph (c)(4) along with all supporting data, calculations, and other information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reevaluate determinations made under this paragraph (c)(4) after any process change that affects the feedstock or product composition. Keep records of the process change and the corresponding composition determinations. If the feedstock or product composition changes so that the average monthly concentration falls below 99.5 percent, you are no longer permitted to use this alternative method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Calculate the CO2 mass emissions for each petrochemical process unit using Equations X-1 through X-4 of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gaseous feedstocks and products. Use Equation X-1 of this section to calculate the net annual carbon input or output from gaseous feedstocks and products. Note that the result will be a negative value if there are no gaseous feedstocks in the process but there are gaseous products.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29NO13.017
