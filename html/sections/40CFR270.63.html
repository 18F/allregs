                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of allowing an owner or operator to meet the  treatment demonstration requirements of Sec.  264.272 of this chapter,  the Director may issue a treatment demonstration permit. The permit must  contain only those requirements necessary to meet the standards in Sec.   264.272(c). The permit may be issued either as a treatment or disposal  permit covering only the field test or laboratory analyses, or as a two- phase facility permit covering the field tests, or laboratory analyses,  and design, construction operation and maintenance of the land treatment  unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director may issue a two-phase facility permit if he finds  that, based on information submitted in part B of the application,  substantial, although incomplete or inconclusive, information already  exists upon which to base the issuance of a facility permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Director finds that not enough information exists upon  which he can establish permit conditions to attempt to provide for  compliance with all of the requirements of subpart M, he must issue a  treatment demonstration permit covering only the field test or  laboratory analyses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Director finds that a phased permit may be issued, he  will establish, as requirements in the first phase of the facility  permit, conditions for conducting the field tests or laboratory  analyses. These permit conditions will include design and operating  parameters (including the duration of the tests or analyses and, in the  case of field tests, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the  treatment zone), monitoring procedures, post-demonstration clean-up  activities, and any other conditions which the Director finds may be  necessary under Sec.  264.272(c). The Director will include   conditions in the second phase of the facility permit to attempt to meet  all subpart M requirements pertaining to unit design, construction,  operation, and maintenance. The Director will establish these conditions  in the second phase of the permit based upon the substantial but  incomplete or inconclusive information contained in the part B  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first phase of the permit will be effective as provided in  Sec.  124.15(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The second phase of the permit will be effective as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the owner or operator who has been issued a two-phase  permit has completed the treatment demonstration, he must submit to the  Director a certification, signed by a person authorized to sign a permit  application or report under Sec.  270.11, that the field tests or  laboratory analyses have been carried out in accordance with the  conditions specified in phase one of the permit for conducting such  tests or analyses. The owner or operator must also submit all data  collected during the field tests or laboratory analyses within 90 days  of completion of those tests or analyses unless the Director approves a  later date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Director determines that the results of the field tests  or laboratory analyses meet the requirements of Sec.  264.272 of this  chapter, he will modify the second phase of the permit to incorporate  any requirements necessary for operation of the facility in compliance  with part 264, subpart M, of this chapter, based upon the results of the  field tests or laboratory analyses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This permit modification may proceed under Sec.  270.42, or  otherwise will proceed as a modification under Sec.  270.41(a)(2). If  such modifications are necessary, the second phase of the permit will  become effective only after those modifications have been made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If no modifications of the second phase of the permit are  necessary, the Director will give notice of his final decision to the  permit applicant and to each person who submitted written comments on  the phased permit or who requested notice of the final decision on the  second phase of the permit. The second phase of the permit then will  become effective as specified in Sec.  124.15(b).  [48 FR 14228, Apr. 1, 1983, as amended at 53 FR 37939, Sept. 28, 1988]</p>
