                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This standard applies to power-operated equipment, when used in construction, that can hoist, lower and horizontally move a suspended load. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to: Articulating cranes (such as knuckle-boom cranes); crawler cranes; floating cranes; cranes on barges; locomotive cranes; mobile cranes (such as wheel-mounted, rough-terrain, all-terrain, commercial truck-mounted, and boom truck cranes); multi-purpose machines when configured to hoist and lower (by means of a winch or hook) and horizontally move a suspended load; industrial cranes (such as carry-deck cranes); dedicated pile drivers; service/mechanic trucks with a hoisting device; a crane on a monorail; tower cranes (such as a fixed jib, i.e., ``hammerhead boom''), luffing boom and self-erecting); pedestal cranes; portal cranes; overhead and gantry cranes; straddle cranes; sideboom cranes; derricks; and variations of such equipment. However, items listed in paragraph (c) of this section are excluded from the scope of this standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Attachments. This standard applies to equipment included in paragraph (a) of this section when used with attachments. Such attachments, whether crane-attached or suspended include, but are not limited to: Hooks, magnets, grapples, clamshell buckets, orange peel buckets, concrete buckets, drag lines, personnel platforms, augers or drills and pile driving equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exclusions. This subpart does not cover:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Machinery included in paragraph (a) of this section while it has been converted or adapted for a non-hoisting/lifting use. Such conversions/adaptations include, but are not limited to, power shovels, excavators and concrete pumps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Power shovels, excavators, wheel loaders, backhoes, loader backhoes, track loaders. This machinery is also excluded when used with chains, slings or other rigging to lift suspended loads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Automotive wreckers and tow trucks when used to clear wrecks and haul vehicles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Digger derricks when used for augering holes for poles carrying electric or telecommunication lines, placing and removing the poles, and for handling associated materials for installation on, or removal from, the poles, or when used for any other work subject to subpart V of this part. To be eligible for this exclusion, digger-derrick use in work subject to subpart V of this part must comply with all of the provisions of that subpart, and digger-derrick use in construction work for telecommunication service (as defined at Sec. 1910.268(s)(40)) must comply with all of the provisions of Sec. 1910.268.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Machinery originally designed as vehicle-mounted aerial devices (for lifting personnel) and self-propelled elevating work platforms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Telescopic/hydraulic gantry systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Stacker cranes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Powered industrial trucks (forklifts), except when configured to hoist and lower (by means of a winch or hook) and horizontally move a suspended load.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Mechanic's truck with a hoisting device when used in activities related to equipment maintenance and repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Machinery that hoists by using a come-a-long or chainfall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Dedicated drilling rigs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Gin poles when used for the erection of communication towers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Tree trimming and tree removal work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Anchor handling or dredge-related operations with a vessel or barge using an affixed A-frame.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Roustabouts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Helicopter cranes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Material Delivery</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Articulating/knuckle-boom truck cranes that deliver material to a construction site when used to transfer materials from the truck crane to the ground, without arranging the materials in a particular sequence for hoisting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Articulating/knuckle-boom truck cranes that deliver material to a construction site when the crane is used to transfer building supply sheet goods or building supply packaged materials from the truck crane onto a structure, using a fork/cradle at the end of the boom, but only when the truck crane is equipped with a properly functioning automatic overload prevention device. Such sheet goods or packaged materials include, but are not limited to: Sheets of sheet rock, sheets of plywood, bags of cement, sheets or packages of roofing shingles, and rolls of roofing felt.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This exclusion does not apply when:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The articulating/knuckle-boom crane is used to hold, support or stabilize the material to facilitate a construction activity, such as holding material in place while it is attached to the structure;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The material being handled by the articulating/knuckle-boom crane is a prefabricated component. Such prefabricated components include, but are not limited to: Precast concrete members or panels, roof trusses (wooden, cold-formed metal, steel, or other material), prefabricated building sections such as, but not limited to: Floor panels, wall panels, roof panels, roof structures, or similar items;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The material being handled by the crane is a structural steel member (for example, steel joists, beams, columns, steel decking (bundled or unbundled) or a component of a systems-engineered metal building (as defined in 29 CFR 1926 subpart R).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The activity is not specifically excluded under Sec. 1400(c)(17)(i) and (ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All sections of this subpart CC apply to the equipment covered by this standard unless specified otherwise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The duties of controlling entities under this subpart include, but are not limited to, the duties specified in Sec.
