If the owner desires for any reason that payment be made to  another, without intermediate assignment, the debentures should be  assigned to ``The Federal Housing Commissioner for redemption (or,  purchase) for the account of --------,'' inserting the name and address  of the person to whom payment is to be made. Proof of the authority of  the individual assigning on behalf of an owner will be required in  accordance with part 306 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An assignment in blank or other assignment having similar effect  will be recognized, but in that event the debenture would be, in effect,  payable to bearer, and payment will be made in accordance with the  instructions received from the person surrendering the debenture for  redemption or purchase. For the owner's protection, such assignments  should be avoided unless the owner is willing to lose the protection  afforded by registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Debentures submitted for conversion to book-entry form should be  assigned to ``The Federal Housing Commissioner for conversion to book- entry debentures for the account of --------.'' The registration on the  book-entry account and/or the account number in which the debentures  should be deposited should be indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All assignments must be made on the debentures themselves unless  otherwise authorized by the Department of Treasury.</p>
