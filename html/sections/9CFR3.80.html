                            <p class="depth0">Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must meet the following  minimum requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary enclosures must be designed  and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally  sound for the species of nonhuman primates contained in them. They must  be kept in good repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that  they:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have no sharp points or edges that could injure the nonhuman  primates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Protect the nonhuman primates from injury;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contain the nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental  opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Keep other unwanted animals from entering the enclosure or  having physical contact with the nonhuman primates;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Enable the nonhuman primates to remain dry and clean;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Provide shelter and protection from extreme temperatures and  weather conditions that may be uncomfortable or hazardous to the species  of nonhuman primate contained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Provide sufficient shade to shelter all the nonhuman primates  housed in the primary enclosure at one time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Provide the nonhuman primates with easy and convenient access  to clean food and water;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Enable all surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates to be  readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.84(b)(3) of  this subpart, or replaced when worn or soiled;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the  nonhuman primates from injuring themselves; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Provide sufficient space for the nonhuman primates to make  normal postural adjustments with freedom of movement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum space requirements. Primary enclosures must meet the  minimum space requirements provided in this subpart. These minimum space  requirements must be met even if perches, ledges, swings, or other  suspended fixtures are placed in the enclosure. Low perches and ledges  that do not   allow the space underneath them to be comfortably occupied by the animal  will be counted as part of the floor space.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to February 15, 1994:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so as to  provide sufficient space to allow each nonhuman primate to make normal  postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each nonhuman primate housed in a primary enclosure must be  provided with a minimum floor space equal to an area at least three  times the area occupied by the primate when standing on four feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On and after February 15, 1994:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The minimum space that must be provided to each nonhuman  primate, whether housed individually or with other nonhuman primates,  will be determined by the typical weight of animals of its species,  except for brachiating species and great apes \3\ and will be calculated  by using the following table: \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">\3\ The different species of nonhuman primates are divided into six  weight groups for determining minimum space requirements, except that  all brachiating species of any weight are grouped together since they  require additional space to engage in species-typical behavior. The  grouping provided is based upon the typical weight for various species  and not on changes associated with obesity, aging, or pregnancy. These  conditions will not be considered in determining a nonhuman primate's  weight group unless the animal is obviously unable to make normal  postural adjustments and movements within the primary enclosure.  Different species of prosimians vary in weight and should be grouped  with their appropriate weight group. They have not been included in the  weight table since different species typically fall into different  weight groups. Infants and juveniles of certain species are  substantially lower in weight than adults of those species and require  the minimum space requirements of lighter weight species, unless the  animal is obviously unable to make normal postural adjustments and  movements within the primary enclosure.</p><p class="depth4">\4\ Examples of the kinds of nonhuman primates typically included in  each age group are:</p><p class="depth4">Group 1--marmosets, tamarins, and infants (less than 6 months of  age) of various species.</p><p class="depth4">Group 2--capuchins, squirrel monkeys and similar size species, and  juveniles (6 months to 3 years of age) of various species.</p><p class="depth4">Group 3--macaques and African species.</p><p class="depth4">Group 4--male macaques and large African species.</p><p class="depth4">Group 5--baboons and nonbrachiating species larger than 33.0 lbs.  (15 kg.).</p><p class="depth4">Group 6--great apes over 55.0 lbs. (25 kg.), except as provided in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and brachiating species.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Weight                   Floor area/animal         Height</p><p class="depth4">Group              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">lbs.

(50  kg) an additional volume of space in excess of that required for Group 6  animals as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, to allow  for normal postural adjustments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of research facilities, any exemption from these  standards must be required by a research proposal or in the judgment of  the attending veterinarian and must be approved by the Committee. In the  case of dealers and exhibitors, any exemption from these standards must  be required in the judgment of the attending veterinarian and approved  by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When more than one nonhuman primate is housed in a primary  enclosure, the minimum space requirement for the enclosure is the sum of  the minimum floor area space required for each individual nonhuman  primate in the table in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this   section, and the minimum height requirement for the largest nonhuman  primate housed in the enclosure. Provided however, that mothers with  infants less than 6 months of age may be maintained together in primary  enclosures that meet the floor area space and height requirements of the  mother.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Innovative primary enclosures not precisely meeting the floor  area and height requirements provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of  this section, but that do provide nonhuman primates with a sufficient  volume of space and the opportunity to express species-typical behavior,  may be used at research facilities when approved by the Committee, and  by dealers and exhibitors when approved by the Administrator.
