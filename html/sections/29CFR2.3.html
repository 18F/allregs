Such application, directed to the Secretary should:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State the former connection of the applicant with the Department;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identify the matter in which the applicant desires to appear, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contain a statement to the effect that the applicant gave no personal consideration to such matter while he was an employee of the Department.
The application will be denied if the statements contained therein are disproved by an examination of the files, records, and circumstances pertaining to the matter, or if, in the opinion of the Secretary or his duly authorized representative, the public interest so requires. If the Secretary or his duly authorized representative is satisfied that the applicant gave no personal consideration to the matter in question while employed by the Department, and if he is satisfied that it is lawful and consistent with the public interest to do so, he may grant his consent, in writing, to the request of the applicant, subject to such conditions, if any, as he deems necessary and desirable. Any function of the Secretary under this section may be performed by the Under Secretary of Labor.</p>
