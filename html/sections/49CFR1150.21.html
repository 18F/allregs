                            <p class="depth0">These special rules apply to operations over abandoned rail lines, which have been acquired (through purchase or lease) by a State. The rail line must have fully abandoned, or approved for abandonment by the Board or a bankruptcy court. As used in these rules, the term ``State'' includes States, political subdivisions of States, and all instrumentalities through which the State can act. An operator has the option of applying for a modified certificate of public convenience and necessity under this subpart or a common carrier certificate under Subpart A of this part. A copy of the modified certificate shall be served on the Association of American Railroads.</p>
