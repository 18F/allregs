                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When an application is filed for benefits. Documentary evidence of marriage is required when an individual files for a monthly annuity, lump-sum death payment, residual lump sum, or Medicare coverage, as the wife, husband, widow, widower, divorced spouse or surviving divorced spouse, or stepparent of the employee. A claimant may also be required to submit evidence of another person's marriage

when that person's marriage is necessary to determine the applicant's entitlement to benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State law. In deciding whether the marriage to the employee is valid or not, in a case where the employee is living, the Board will follow the law of the state where the employee had a permanent home when the applicant filed an application; in a case where the employee is dead, the Board will follow the law of the state where the employee had a permanent home when he or she died.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Types of evidence. What evidence will be required depends on whether the employee's marriage was a ceremonial marriage, a common-law marriage, or a marriage that can be deemed to be valid.</p>
