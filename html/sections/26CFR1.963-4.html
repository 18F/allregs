A pro rata minimum distribution from a chain or group for the taxable year is a distribution of earnings and profits to the United States shareholder, with respect to stock to which the chain or group election relates, which is the statutory percentage (applicable with respect to such chain or group as determined under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.963-2) of the United States shareholder's proportionate share of the taxable year's earnings and profits of each foreign corporation in such chain or group (determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.963-2 but without making any deduction under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of such section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Overall United States and foreign income tax.

Such overall United States and foreign income tax shall be determined with respect to such minimum distribution without taking into account any foreign income tax which is deemed paid for such year under section 904(d), relating to carryback and carryover of excess tax paid. For purposes of this subdivision, the consolidated foreign income taxes of the chain or group shall be determined under paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 1.963-2, applied without regard to the second sentence of paragraph (d)(1) of that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxes paid by foreign corporation on distributions received during its distribution period. For purposes of determining foreign income tax deemed paid by the United States shareholder for the taxable year under section 902, if a distribution received by a foreign corporation in a chain or group from another foreign corporation in such chain or group after the close of the recipient's taxable year but during its distribution period for such year is allocated to the earnings and profits of such recipient corporation for such year under paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.963-3, any foreign income tax paid or accrued by such recipient corporation on such distribution shall be treated as paid or accrued for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Illustration. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Domestic corporation M directly owns all of the one class of stock of foreign corporation A, which in turn directly owns all of the one class of stock of foreign corporation B. Corporation M makes a chain election with respect to A Corporation and B Corporation. All such corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. Assuming that A Corporation does not incur foreign tax on amounts distributed by B Corporation, the foreign income tax and earnings and profits of corporations A and B, the effective foreign tax rate, and the statutory percentage for 1966, are as follows:

For purposes of determining the minimum overall tax burden under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, Secs. 1.963-2 and 1.963-3 shall apply as modified by the following subparagraphs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Exclusion of tax on intercorporate distributions. The consolidated earnings and profits and consolidated foreign income taxes of a chain or group for the taxable year shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 1.963-2, except that foreign income tax referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of such section may be taken into account in determining the effective foreign tax rate only--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To the extent that such tax is not deemed paid by the United States shareholder under section 902 (as modified by paragraph (c) of this section) for its taxable year to which the chain or group election relates, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If, by taking the tax into account, the effective foreign tax rate with respect to such chain or group, as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.963-2, exceeds the highest effective foreign tax rate requiring a distribution under section 963(b) for such year of the shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of deficits. For purposes of determining the amount of each foreign corporation's share of a pro rata minimum distribution from a chain or group for the taxable year and for purposes of determining the foreign tax credit under paragraph (c) of this section of the United States shareholder with respect to any minimum distribution from a chain or group for the taxable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deficits of foreign corporations. The total of the United States shareholder's proportionate shares, as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of Sec. 1.963-2, of the deficit of every foreign corporation in the chain or group having a deficit for the taxable year shall be allocated against and shall reduce such shareholder's proportionate share, as determined under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of Sec. 1.963-2, of the earnings and profits for the taxable year of each other foreign corporation in the chain or group having earnings and profits for such year in an amount which bears to such total of shares of deficit the same ratio which such share of earnings and profits bears to the total of such shareholder's proportionate shares, as so determined, of the earnings and profits of all foreign corporations in the chain or group having earnings and profits for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deficits of foreign branches. If for the taxable year a group includes under paragraph (f)(4) of Sec. 1.963-1 foreign branches the aggregate of whose allowable deductions (other than any net operating loss deduction) exceeds the aggregate of their gross incomes for the

taxable year, determined as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of such section, the amount of such excess shall be allocated as provided by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions through a chain or group. In determining whether and to what extent a distribution for any taxable year has been made out of the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation included in a chain of ownership described in section 958(a) consisting of two or more corporations in a chain or group for the taxable year, the following subdivisions shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allocation first to income received as a distribution. If any foreign corporation included in the chain or group for the taxable year receives a distribution for such year from another foreign corporation in the chain or group and in turn makes a distribution for the taxable year, the distribution so made shall first be allocated to the earnings and profits, to the extent thereof, attributable to the distribution so received; if distributions are received from more than one other corporation in the chain or group, the distribution made by the recipient corporation shall be apportioned among all such amounts. For purposes of determining whether a distribution is made or received for the taxable year, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.963-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Successive distributions through a chain or group. If any foreign corporation included in the chain or group for the taxable year distributes an amount from its earnings and profits of such year, the amount so distributed shall be considered to be received from such earnings and profits by the United States shareholder to the extent the amount is distributed by successive distributions made by each other foreign corporation in the chain or group for the taxable year through the chain of ownership described in section 958(a) into the hands of such shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Distribution determined without reduction by taxes of intervening corporations. If, for the taxable year to which the election to secure an exclusion under section 963 applies, the United States shareholder receives a distribution to which subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies, the entire amount distributed by the foreign corporation from such shareholder's proportionate share of its earnings and profits for the taxable year shall, except where taxes referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.963-2 are taken into account as provided by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, count toward a minimum distribution and shall not be reduced for such purpose by a foreign income tax paid or accrued on such amount by another foreign corporation in the chain or group through which such amount is distributed by successive distributions into the hands of such shareholder. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For 1966, domestic corporation M makes a chain election with respect to controlled foreign corporation A, all the one class of stock of which is directly owned by M Corporation, and controlled foreign corporation B, all the one class of stock of which is directly owned by A Corporation. All corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation M complies with the special rules of this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section for the taxable year. Corporation A's only income for 1966 is a dividend of $52.50 distributed in such year by B Corporation, on which A Corporation is subject to an income tax of $10.50. The remaining $42 ($52.50 less $10.50) is distributed by A Corporation for 1966 to M Corporation. The full $52.50 distributed by B Corporation counts toward a minimum distribution by the chain for 1966.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For 1966, domestic corporation M makes a chain election with respect to controlled foreign corporation A, all the one class of stock of which it owns directly, and controlled foreign corporation B, all the one class of stock of which A Corporation own directly. All corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. Corporation M complies with the special rules of this paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section for the taxable year. The predistribution and pretax earnings and profits for 1966 of B Corporation are $100, and of A Corporation, $0. Corporation B pays foreign income tax of $30 and during the year distributes $70. On such $70, A Corporation pays foreign income tax of $14. By applying paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.963-2, the consolidated foreign income taxes of the chain for 1966 are $44 ($30+$14) and the consolidated earnings and profits of the chain are $56 ($70-$14); in such case, the effective foreign tax rate of the chain for 1966 is 44 percent ($44/[$56+$44]) and thus in excess of the highest effective foreign tax rate requiring a distribution for such year under section 963(b). Since M Corporation may thus take A Corporation's tax of $14 into account,

the statutory percentage under section 963(b) for 1966 is zero percent and the amount of the minimum distribution required to be made by the chain is $0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special foreign tax credit rules--(1) In general. In determining the minimum overall tax burden under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the foreign tax credit of the United States shareholder with respect to a minimum distribution received for the taxable year from the chain or group shall be determined under the provisions of sections 901 through 905 as modified by Sec. 1.963-3 except that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In determining the minimum overall tax burden under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the foreign tax credit of the United States shareholder with respect to a minimum distribution received for the taxable year from the chain or group shall be determined under the provisions of sections 901 through 905 as modified by Sec. 1.963-3 except that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Taxes of a second-tier corporation making a distribution through a first-tier corporation shall not be averaged with taxes of such first-tier corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxes of a first-tier corporation or a second-tier corporation on a distribution made through such corporation shall not be averaged with such corporation's taxes on its other income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxes of a first-tier corporation or a second-tier corporation shall not be deemed paid with respect to distributions from the earnings and profits of such corporation which are offset by a deficit allocated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the United States shareholder's proportionate share of the earnings and profits of such corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The foreign tax credit may be reduced and the reduction deferred under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph to another taxable year of the United States shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonaveraging of tax--(i) Year of minimum distribution--(a) Taxes deemed paid by a first-tier corporation and taxes actually paid by such corporation. If, by successive distributions through a chain or group, a United States shareholder receives for a taxable year a distribution of the earnings and profits for such year of any corporation in such chain or group, and if both section 902(a) and section 902(b) apply with respect to such distribution, all the taxes deemed paid under section 902(b) by the first-tier corporation described in section 902(a) with respect to such distribution of such earnings and profits shall be deemed paid by the United States shareholder for such taxable year under section 902(a) with respect to the earnings and profits so distributed and, notwithstanding the rules otherwise applicable under section 902, no part of the taxes so deemed paid by such first-tier corporation shall be attributed to other earnings and profits of such first-tier corporation for such year and no part of the taxes paid or accrued with respect to such other earnings and profits shall be attributed to the earnings and profits so received as a distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxes of a foreign corporation paid on intercorporate distributions and on other income. If, by successive distributions through a chain or group, a United States shareholder receives for a taxable year a distribution of the earnings and profits for such year of any corporation in such chain or group, then in applying section 902(a) with respect to such distribution through a first-tier corporation described in section 902(a), or in applying section 902(b) with respect to such distribution through a second-tier corporation described in section 902(b), as the case may be, the taxes of such corporation which shall be taken into account in determining taxes deemed paid under such section shall be the foreign income tax actually paid or accrued for the taxable year by such first-tier or second-tier corporation, as the case may be, with respect to such distribution; and, notwithstanding the rules otherwise applicable under section 902, no part of the taxes so paid by such first-tier or second-tier corporation shall be attributed to other earnings and profits of such corporation for such year and no part of the taxes paid or accrued with respect to such other earnings and profits shall be attributed to the earnings and profits so received as a distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Corporation with earnings and profits reduced by allocated deficits. In the application of section 902, a United States shareholder's proportionate share of the earnings and profits for the taxable year of a foreign corporation to which the chain or group election applies shall reflect the reduction of such earnings and profits by deficits allocated thereto under paragraph

(b)(2) of this section. No taxes paid or accrued by such corporation shall be deemed paid under section 902 with respect to a distribution to such shareholder from the earnings and profits of such corporation for such year to the extent that such distribution exceeds the shareholder's proportionate share as so reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Year of distribution of remaining earnings and profits.

the pretax and predistribution earnings and profits of such foreign corporation for such year to which such minimum distribution is attributable and the foreign income tax which is taken into account in determining tax deemed paid under section 902 on such pretax and predistribution earnings and profits shall not be taken into account in the application of section 902 when other earnings and profits of such foreign corporation for such year are distributed in a subsequent taxable year of such foreign corporation to such shareholder. For the purpose of applying the preceding sentence to a case in which (c) of this subdivision applies, the pretax and predistribution earnings and profits of the foreign corporation for such year to which the minimum distributed is attributable shall be the amount of such corporation's earnings and profits which are distributed and count toward the minimum distribution plus the foreign income tax of such foreign corporation allocated thereto in determining the taxes deemed paid under section 902 for the taxable year of the minimum distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Domestic corporation M makes a chain election for 1966 with respect to controlled foreign corporation A, which is wholly owned directly by M Corporation, and controlled foreign corporation B, which is wholly owned directly by A Corporation. Each corporation uses the calendar year as the taxable year. In 1966, corporations A and B are subject to foreign income tax at the rates of 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively, with no deduction being allowed for dividends received or paid; each such corporation has pretax and predistribution earnings and profits of $100. Corporation M receives from the chain a pro rata minimum distribution for such year and applies thereto the special rules of this paragraph and paragraph (b) of this section. Corporation A is not a less developed country corporation under section 902(d). The 1966 foreign income tax of corporations A and B which is deemed paid by M Corporation under section 902(a) for 1966, and the remaining tax which is allocated to earnings and profits to be distributed to M Corporation in future years, are determined as follows:

The amount of any reduction in foreign tax credit for the taxable year which is made under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph with respect to a minimum distribution for any taxable year from the chain or group shall be allocated among any first-tier and second-tier corporations described in section 902 (a) and (b), respectively, which are in such chain or group. The amount of any such reduction in foreign tax credit shall be allocated among such first-tier and second-tier corporations in the ratio which the United States shareholder's proportionate share of undistributed earnings and profits of each such corporation for the taxable year bears to the total of such shareholder's proportionate shares of the undistributed earnings and profits of all such corporations for such year.

Thus, for example, in the case of a distribution in the subsequent year from such earnings and profits by a first-tier corporation, the tax deemed paid shall be an amount which bears to the total of such reduction in foreign tax credit the same ratio that the distribution to the shareholder in the subsequent year bears to such shareholder's proportionate share of such undistributed earnings and profits for the year of allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitations on use of deferred credit.

Any amount by which the deferred tax so deemed paid in such subsequent taxable year exceeds the limitation under the preceding sentence shall not be carried back or carried over under section 904(d) to another taxable year of the United States shareholder.

Domestic group M, an affiliated group of domestic corporations filing a consolidated return under section 1501, makes a group election for 1963 with respect to a group consisting of two controlled foreign corporations C and D, all of whose one class of stock is directly owned by group M, and foreign branch B, a foreign branch of a Western Hemisphere trade corporation (as defined in section 921) included in group M. No distributions are received for the taxable year from corporations C and D, but the foreign group makes a minimum distribution by reason of the deemed distribution of all of branch B's earnings and profits. Group M complies with the special rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For 1963, a year for which the United States corporate income tax rate is 52 percent, the overall limitation under section 904(a)(2) on the foreign tax credit applies. All corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. None of the foreign corporations is a less developed country corporation under section 902(d) for 1963. The income, and the United States and foreign income tax for 1963, are determined as follows, based upon the facts assumed:
