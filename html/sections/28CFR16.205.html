                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Finding. Based upon a review of the meetings of the U.S. Parole Commission since the effective date of the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act (May 14, 1976), the regulations issued pursuant thereto (28 CFR part 2) the experience of the U.S. Board of Parole, and the regulations pertaining to the Commission's authority under 29 U.S.C. 504 and 29 U.S.C. 1111 (28 CFR parts 4 and 4a), the Commission finds that the majority of its meetings may properly be closed to the public pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (d)(4) and (c)(10). The

major part of normal Commission business lies in the adjudication of individual parole cases, all of which proceedings commence with an initial parole or revocation hearing and are determined on the record thereof.
Original jurisdiction cases are decided at bi-monthly meetings of the National Commissioners (28 CFR 2.17) and by the entire Commission in conjunction with each business meeting of the Commission (held at least quarterly) (28 CFR 2.27).
The National Appeals Board normally decides cases by sequential vote on a daily basis, but may meet from time to time for joint deliberations. In the period from October, 1975 through September, 1976, the National Appeals Board made 2,072 Appellate decisions.
Finally, over the last two years the Commission determined eleven cases under the Labor and Pension Acts, which are proceedings pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554. The only meetings of the Commission not of an adjudicative nature involving the most sensitive inquiry into the personal background and behavior of the individual concerned, or involving sensitive financial information concerning the parties before the Commission, are the normal business meetings of the Commission, which are held at least quarterly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Meetings to which applicable. The following types of meetings may be closed in the event that a majority of the Commissioners present at the meeting, and authorized to act on behalf of the Commission, votes by recorded vote at the beginning of each meeting or portion thereof, to close the meeting or portions thereof:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Original jurisdiction initial and appellate case deliberations conducted pursuant to 28 CFR 2.17 and 2.27;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> National Appeals Board deliberations pursuant to 28 CFR 2.26;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Meetings of the Commission to conduct a hearing on the record regarding applications for certificates of exemption pursuant to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 504, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1111 (28 CFR 4.1-17 and 29 CFR 4a.1-17). \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ Part 4a was removed at 44 FR 6890, Feb. 2, 1979.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Written record of action to close meeting. In the case of a meeting or portion of a meeting closed pursuant to this section, the Commission shall make available to the public as soon as practicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written record reflecting the vote of each member of the Commission to close the meeting; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certification by the Commission's General Counsel to the effect that in Counsel's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, which certification shall state each relevant exemptive provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public notice. In the case of meetings closed pursuant to this section the Commission shall make a public announcement of the subject matter to be considered, and the date, place, and time of the meeting. The announcement described herein shall be released to the public at the earliest practicable time.</p>
