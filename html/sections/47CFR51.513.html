                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A state commission may determine that the cost information  available to it with respect to one or more elements does not support  the adoption of a rate or rates that are consistent with the  requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 51.505 and 51.511. In that event,  the state commission may establish a rate for an element that is  consistent with the proxies specified in this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any rate established through use of such proxies shall be  superseded once the state commission has completed review of a cost  study that complies with the forward-looking economic cost based pricing  methodology described in Sec. Sec. 51.505 and 51.511, and has concluded  that such study is a reasonable basis for establishing element rates;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The state commission sets forth in writing a reasonable basis  for its selection of a particular rate for the element.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The constraints on proxy-based rates described in this section  apply on a geographically averaged basis. For purposes of determining  whether geographically deaveraged rates for elements comply with the  provisions of this section, a geographically averaged proxy-based rate  shall be computed based on the weighted average of the actual,  geographically deaveraged rates that apply in separate geographic areas  in a state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proxies for specific elements--(1) Local loops. For each state  listed below, the proxy-based monthly rate for unbundled local loops, on  a statewide weighted average basis, shall be no greater than the figures  listed in the table below. (The Commission has not established a default  proxy ceiling for loop rates in Alaska.)</p><p class="depth0">Table ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Proxy</p><p class="depth0">State                               ceiling ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Alabama.......................................................    $17.25 Arizona.......................................................     12.85 Arkansas......................................................     21.18 California....................................................     11.10 Colorado......................................................     14.97 Connecticut...................................................     13.23 Delaware......................................................     13.24 District of Columbia..........................................     10.81 Florida.......................................................     13.68 Georgia.......................................................     16.09 Hawaii........................................................     15.27 Idaho.........................................................     20.16 Illinois......................................................     13.12 Indiana.......................................................     13.29 Iowa..........................................................     15.94 Kansas........................................................     19.85 Kentucky......................................................     16.70 Louisiana.....................................................     16.98 Maine.........................................................     18.69 Maryland......................................................     13.36 Massachusetts.................................................      9.83 Michigan......................................................     15.27 Minnesota.....................................................     14.81 Mississippi...................................................     21.97 Missouri......................................................     18.32 Montana.......................................................     25.18 Nebraska......................................................     18.05 Nevada........................................................     18.95 New Hampshire.................................................     16.00 New Jersey....................................................     12.47 New Mexico....................................................     18.66 New York......................................................     11.75 North Carolina................................................     16.71 North Dakota..................................................     25.36 Ohio..........................................................     15.73 Oklahoma......................................................     17.63 Oregon........................................................     15.44 Pennsylvania..................................................     12.30 Puerto Rico...................................................     12.47 Rhode Island..................................................     11.48 South Carolina................................................     17.07 South Dakota..................................................     25.33 Tennessee.....................................................     17.41 Texas.........................................................     15.49 Utah..........................................................     15.12 Vermont.......................................................     20.13 Virginia......................................................     14.13 Washington....................................................     13.37 West Virginia.................................................     19.25 Wisconsin.....................................................     15.94 Wyoming.......................................................     25.11 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Local switching. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The blended proxy-based rate for the usage- sensitive component of the unbundled local switching element, including  the switching matrix, the functionalities used to provide vertical  features, and the trunk ports, shall be no greater than 0.4 cents  ($0.004) per minute, and no less than 0.2 cents ($0.002) per minute,  except that, where a state commission has, before August 8, 1996,  established a rate less than or equal to 0.5 cents ($0.005) per minute,  that rate may be retained pending completion of a forward-looking  economic cost study. If a flat-rated charge is established for these  components, it shall be converted to a per-minute rate by dividing the  projected average minutes of use per flat-rated subelement, for purposes  of assessing compliance with this proxy. A weighted average of such  flat-rate or usage-sensitive charges shall be used in appropriate  circumstances, such as when peak and off-peak charges are used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The blended proxy-based rate for the line port component of the  local switching element shall be no less than $1.10, and no more than  $2.00, per line port per month for ports used in the delivery of basic  residential and business exchange services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dedicated transmission links. The proxy-based rates for  dedicated transmission links shall be no greater than the incumbent  LEC's tariffed interstate charges for comparable entrance facilities or  direct-trunked transport offerings, as described in Sec. Sec. 69.110  and 69.112 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Shared transmission facilities between tandem switches and end  offices.   The proxy-based rates for shared transmission facilities between tandem  switches and end offices shall be no greater than the weighted per- minute equivalent of DS1 and DS3 interoffice dedicated transmission link  rates that reflects the relative number of DS1 and DS3 circuits used in  the tandem to end office links (or a surrogate based on the proportion  of copper and fiber facilities in the interoffice network), calculated  using a loading factor of 9,000 minutes per month per voice-grade  circuit, as described in Sec. 69.112 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tandem switching. The proxy-based rate for tandem switching  shall be no greater than 0.15 cents ($0.0015) per minute of use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Collocation. To the extent that the incumbent LEC offers a  comparable form of collocation in its interstate expanded  interconnection tariffs, as described in Sec. Sec. 64.1401 and 69.121  of this chapter, the proxy-based rates for collocation shall be no  greater than the effective rates for equivalent services in the  interstate expanded interconnection tariff. To the extent that the  incumbent LEC does not offer a comparable form of collocation in its  interstate expanded interconnection tariffs, a state commission may, in  its discretion, establish a proxy-based rate, provided that the state  commission sets forth in writing a reasonable basis for concluding that  its rate would approximate the result of a forward-looking economic cost  study, as described in Sec. 51.505.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Signaling, call-related database, and other elements. To the  extent that the incumbent LEC has established rates for offerings  comparable to other elements in its interstate access tariffs, and has  provided cost support for those rates pursuant to Sec. 61.49(h) of this  chapter, the proxy-based rates for those elements shall be no greater  than the effective rates for equivalent services in the interstate  access tariffs. In other cases, the proxy-based rate shall be no greater  than a rate based on direct costs plus a reasonable allocation of  overhead loadings, pursuant to Sec. 61.49(h) of this chapter.
