                                Sec. 1.803-5  Real estate owned and occupied.

                            <p class="depth0">The amount allowable as a deduction for taxes, expenses, and  depreciation upon or with respect to any real estate owned and occupied  in whole or in part by a life insurance company is limited to an amount  which bears the same ratio to such deduction (computed without regard to  this limitation) as the rental value of the space not so occupied bears  to the rental value of the entire property. For example, if the rental  value of the space not occupied by the company is equal to one-half of  the rental value of the entire property, the deduction for taxes,  expenses, and depreciation is one-half of the taxes, expenses, and  depreciation on account of the entire property. Where a deduction is  claimed as provided in this section, the parts of the property occupied  and the parts not occupied by the company, together with the respective  rental values thereof, must be shown in a statement accompanying the  return.</p>
