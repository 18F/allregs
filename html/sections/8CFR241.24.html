                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An excluded alien shall, immediately or as promptly as the circumstances permit, be offered for deportation to the master, commanding officer, purser, person in charge, agent, owner, or consignee of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien is to be deported, as determined by the district director, with a written notice specifying the cause of exclusion, the class of travel in which such alien arrived and is to be deported, and with the return of any documentation that will assist in effecting his or her deportation. If special care and attention are required, the provisions of Sec. 241.10 shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure of the carrier to accept for removal an alien who has been ordered excluded and deported shall result in the carrier being assessed any costs incurred by the Service for detention after the carrier's failure to accept the alien for removal including the cost of any transportation. The User Fee Account shall not be assessed for expenses incurred because of the carrier's violation of the provisions of section 237 of the Act and this paragraph. The Service will, at the carrier's option, retain custody of the excluded alien for an additional 7 days beyond the date of the deportation/exclusion order. If, after the third day of this additional 7-day period, the carrier has not made all the necessary transportation arrangements for the excluded alien to be returned to his or her point of embarkation by the end of the additional 7-day period, the Service will make the arrangements and bill the carrier for its costs.</p>
