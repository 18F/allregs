Soil horizons shall be considered as inhibiting or preventing root penetration if their physical or chemical properties or water-supplying capacities cause them to restrict or prevent penetration by roots of plants common to the vicinity of the permit area and if these properties or capacities have little or no beneficial effect on soil productive capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The operator shall replace and regrade the soil horizons or other root-zone material with proper compaction and uniform depth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The operator shall replace the B horizon, C horizon, or other suitable material specified in Sec. 823.12(c)(2) to the thickness needed to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. In those areas where the B or C horizons were not removed but may have been compacted or otherwise damaged during the mining operation, the operator shall engage in deep tilling or other appropriate means to restore pre-mining capabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The operator shall replace the topsoil or other suitable soil materials specified in Sec. 823.12(c)(1) as the final surface soil layer. This surface soil layer shall equal or exceed the thickness of the original surface soil layer, as determined by the soil survey.
