                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval tests. The manufacturer must produce a lot of at least  20 signals from which samples must be taken for testing for approval  under Sec. 160.057-7. The approval tests are the operational tests and  technical tests in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The approval  tests must be conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the  Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and  tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the  procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot  must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by  the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the  rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by  the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot  must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the  reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and  the results of the second test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lot size. For the purposes of sampling the production of  signals, a lot must consist of not more than 1,200 signals. Lots must be  numbered serially by the manufacturer. A new lot must be started with:  (i) Any change in construction details, (ii) any change in sources of  raw materials, or (iii) the start of production on a new production line  or on a previously discontinued production line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's  quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering  into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals,  to determine that signals are being produced in accordance with the  approved plans. Samples from each lot must be tested in accordance with  the operational tests in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An  independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of  this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the  number of lots produced in a year is less than four. The inspections and  tests must occur at least once during each quarterly period, unless no  lots are produced during that period. If less than four lots are  produced, the laboratory must perform or supervise the inspection and  testing of each lot. In addition, the laboratory must perform or  supervise the technical tests in paragraph (d) of this section at least  once for every ten lots of signals produced, except that the number of  technical tests must be at least one but not more than four per year. If  a lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the  laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the  reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each  reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the  purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections  and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operational tests. Each lot of signals must be sampled and  tested as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  corresponding to the lot size. Each signal in the sample is tested as  prescribed in the test procedure in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  Each signal that has a defect listed in the table of defects (Table  160.057-4(c)(2)) is assigned a score (failure percent) in accordance  with that table. In the case of multiple defects, only the score having  the highest numerical value is assigned to that signal If the sum of all  the failure percents (cumulative failure percent) for the number of  units in the sample is less than or equal to the accept criterion, the  lot is accepted. If this sum is equal to or more than the reject  criterion the lot is rejected.  If the cumulative failure percent falls between the accept and reject  criteria, another sample is selected from the   production lot and the operational tests are repeated. The cumulative  failure percent of each sample tested is added to that of the previous  samples to obtain the cumulative failure percent for all the signals  tested (cumulative sample size). Additional samples are tested and the  tests repeated until either the accept or reject criterion for the  cumulative sample size is met. If any signal in the sample explodes when  fired, or ignites in a way that could burn or otherwise injure the  person firing it, the lot is rejected without further testing. (This  procedure is diagrammed in figure 160.057-4(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test procedure. Each sample signal (specimen) must be tested as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Conditioning of test specimens--water resistance. Immerse  specimen horizontally with uppermost portion of the signal approximately  25 mm (1 in.) below the surface of the water for a period of 24 hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Smoke emitting time. Ignite specimen according to the  directions printed on the signal and place signal in tub or barrel of  water. The smoke emitting time of a specimen shall be obtained by stop  watch measurements from the time of distinct, sustained smoke emission  until it ceases. There shall be no flame emission during the entire  smoke emitting time of the signal. The smoke emitting time for a  specimen shall not be less than 15 minutes. When the tests are performed  or supervised by an independent laboratory, this test shall be conducted  with approximately 6 mm (\1/4\ in.) of gasoline covering the water in  the tub or barrel. The gasoline vapors shall not ignite during the  entire smoke emitting time of the signal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ignition and smoke emitting characteristics. Test specimens  shall ignite and emit smoke properly when the directions on the signal  are followed. Test specimens shall not ignite explosively in a manner  that might be dangerous to the user or persons close by. Test specimens  shall emit smoke at a uniform rate while floating in calm to rough  water. Signals should be so constructed that water submerging the signal  in moderately heavy seas will not cause it to become inoperable.</p><p class="depth4">Table 160.057-4(c)(1)--Accept and reject criteria for operational test lots ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Cumula-</p><p class="depth4">Individual                                tive   Accept  Reject</p><p class="depth4">Lot size                       sample              Sample             sample    \1\     \1\</p><p class="depth4">size                                   size ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 150 or                                                    2  First.....................        2   ( \2\     200</p><p class="depth4">)</p><p class="depth4">less.                                          ..........

One signal must be subjected to each of the  following tests. Each signal must pass the test in order for the lot of  signals to be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Drop test. One signal must be attached to a ring life buoy and  arranged   to be ignited by the dropping buoy in the same manner as it would be  when used on a vessel. The signal and buoy must be mounted at least 27 m  (90 ft.) above the surface of a body of water. The buoy is released and  must cause the signal to ignite and fall to the water with the buoy. The  signal must remain afloat and emit smoke at least 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wave test. A signal shall be tested in a manner simulating its  use at sea. The signal shall be ignited and thrown overboard under  conditions where waves are at least 30 cm (1 ft.) high. The smoke  emitting time must be for the full 15 minutes and the signal shall float  in such a manner that it shall function properly during this test. The  signal shall be attached to a ring life buoy in accordance with the  manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Underwater smoke emission. Condition the signal in accordance  with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Ignite specimen and let it  burn about 15 seconds in air. Submerge the burning signal in water in a  vertical position with head down. Obtain underwater smoke emission time  by stop watch measurements from time of submersion until smoke emission  ceases. The test specimen shall emit smoke under water not less than 30  seconds when subjected to this test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Elevated Temperature, Humidity and Storage. Place specimen in a  thermostatically controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 [deg]C.  with not less than 90 percent relative humidity for 72 hours. Remove  specimen and store at room temperature (20[deg] to 25 [deg]C.) with  approximately 65 percent relative humidity for 10 days. If for any  reason it is not possible to operate the oven continuously for the 72- hour period, it may be operated at the required temperature and humidity  for 8 hours out of each 24 during the 72-hour conditioning period.  (Total of 24 hours on and 48 hours off.) The signal shall not ignite or  decompose during this conditioning. The signal shall ignite and operate  satisfactorily following this conditioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Spontaneous ignition. Place the specimen in a thermostatically  controlled even-temperature oven held at 75 [deg]C. with not more than  10% relative humidity for 48 consecutive hours. The signal must not  ignite or undergo marked decomposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Susceptibility to explosion. Remove smoke composition from  signal and punch a small hole in the composition. Insert a No. 6  commercial blasting cap. Ignite the cap. The test specimen shall not  explode or ignite.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Corrosion resistance. Expose the complete specimen with cover  secured hand-tight to a finely divided spray of 20 percent by weight  sodium chloride solution at a temperature between 32 [deg]C and 38  [deg]C (90 [deg]F and 100 [deg]F) for 100 hours. The container and cap  must not be corroded in any fashion that would impair their proper  functioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Color of smoke. Ignite specimen in the open air in daytime  according to the directions printed on the signal, and determine the  smoke color by direct visual comparison of the unshadowed portions of  the smoke with a color chart held so as to receive the same daylight  illumination as the unshadowed portions of the smoke. The color of the  smoke must be orange as defined by sections 13 and 14 of the ``Color  Names Dictionary'' (colors 34-39 and 48-54).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Volume and density of smoke. The test specimen shall show less  than 70 percent transmission for not less than 12 minutes when measured  with apparatus having a light path of 19 cm (7\1/2\ in.), an optical  system aperture of + 3.7 degrees, and an entrance air flow of 18.4m\3\  per minute (650 cu. ft. per minute), such apparatus to be as described  in National Bureau of Standards Report No. 4792.</p>
