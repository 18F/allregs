                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following test parameters are to be used in the  investigation of the circuit covered by Sec. 1211.4(c) for compliance  with the Standard for Safety for Tests for Safety-Related Controls  Employing Solid-State Devices, UL 991, second edition, dated June 23,  1995, as incorporated by reference in paragraph (b)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With regard to electrical supervision of critical components, an  operator being inoperative with respect to   downward movement of the door meets the criteria for trouble indication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A field strength of 3 volts per meter is to be used for the  Radiated EMI Test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Composite Operational and Cycling Test is to be used for 14  days at temperature extremes of minus 35 [deg]Celsius (minus 31 [deg]F)  and 70 [deg]C (158 [deg]F).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exposure Class H5 is to be used for the Humidity Test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A vibration level of 5g is to be used for the Vibration Test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When a Computational Investigation is conducted,  [lambda]p shall not be greater than 6 failures/10\6\ hours  for the entire system. For external secondary entrapment protection  devices that are sold separately, [lambda]p shall not be  greater than 0 failures/10\6\ hours. For internal secondary entrapment  protection devices whether or not they are sold separately,  [lambda]p shall not be greater than 0 failures/10\6\ hours.  The operational test is conducted for 14 days. An external secondary  entrapment protection device that is sold separately, and that has a  [lambda]p greater than 0 failures/10\6\ hours meets the  intent of the requirement when for the combination of the operator and  the specified external secondary entrapment protection device  [lambda]p does not exceed 6 failures/10\6\ hours. See Sec.  1211.15(i) and (k).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When the Demonstrated Method Test is conducted, the multiplier  is to be based on the continuous usage level, and a minimum of 24 units  for a minimum of 24 hours per unit are to be tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The Endurance test is to be conducted concurrently with the  Operational test. The control shall perform its intended function while  being conditioned for fourteen days in an ambient air temperature of 60  [deg]C (140 [deg]F), or 10 [deg]C (18 [deg]F) greater than the operating  temperature of the control, whichever is higher. During the test, the  control is to be operated in a manner representing the opening and  closing of the door at a rate of one open-close operation per minute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For the Electrical Fast Transient Burst Test, test level 3 is to  be used for residential garage door operators.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the evaluation of entrapment protection circuits used in  residential garage door operators, the critical condition flow chart  shown in figure 1 shall be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To conduct a failure-mode and effect analysis (FMEA);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In investigating the performance during the Environmental Stress  Tests; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the Power Cycling Safety for Tests in accordance with the  Standard for Safety for Tests for Safety-Related Controls Employing  Solid-State Devices, UL 991, second edition, dated June 23, 1995.
