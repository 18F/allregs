                            <p class="depth0">This section outlines the procedures to test engines that are  subject to emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the standard-setting part, we set brake-specific emission  standards in g/(kW [middot] hr) (or g/(hp [middot] hr)), for the  following constituents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Total oxides of nitrogen, NOX.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hydrocarbons, HC, which may be expressed in the following ways:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Total hydrocarbons, THC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Nonmethane hydrocarbons, NMHC, which results from subtracting  methane, CH4, from THC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Total hydrocarbon-equivalent, THCE, which results from  adjusting THC mathematically to be equivalent on a carbon-mass basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Nonmethane hydrocarbon-equivalent, NMHCE, which results from  adjusting NMHC mathematically to be equivalent on a carbon-mass basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Particulate matter, PM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Carbon monoxide, CO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Carbon dioxide, CO2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Methane, CH4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Nitrous oxide, N2O.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Note that some engines are not subject to standards for all the  emission constituents identified in paragraph (a) of this section. Note  also that the standard-setting part may include standards for pollutants  not listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We generally set brake-specific emission standards over test  intervals and/or duty cycles, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engine operation. Testing may involve measuring emissions and  work in a laboratory-type environment or in the field, as described in  paragraph (f) of this section. For most laboratory testing, the engine  is operated over one or more duty cycles specified in the standard- setting part. However, laboratory testing may also include non-duty  cycle testing (such as simulation of field testing in a laboratory). For  field testing, the engine is operated under normal in-use operation. The  standard-setting part specifies how test intervals are defined for field  testing. Refer to the definitions of ``duty cycle'' and ``test  interval'' in Sec.  1065.1001. Note that a single duty cycle may have  multiple test intervals and require weighting of results from multiple  test intervals to calculate a composite brake-specific emissions value  to compare to the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Constituent determination. Determine the total mass of each  constituent over a test interval by selecting from the following  methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Continuous sampling. In continuous sampling, measure the  constituent's concentration continuously from raw or dilute exhaust.  Multiply this concentration by the continuous (raw or dilute) flow rate  at the emission sampling location to determine the constituent's flow  rate. Sum the constituent's flow rate continuously over the test  interval. This sum is the total mass of the emitted constituent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Batch sampling. In batch sampling, continuously extract and  store a sample of raw or dilute exhaust for later measurement. Extract a  sample proportional to the raw or dilute exhaust flow rate. You may  extract and store a proportional sample of exhaust in an appropriate  container, such as a bag, and then measure NOX, HC, CO,  CO2, CH4, N2O, and CH2O  concentrations in the container after the test interval. You may deposit  PM from proportionally extracted exhaust onto an appropriate substrate,  such as a filter. In this case, divide the PM by the amount of filtered  exhaust to calculate the PM concentration. Multiply batch sampled  concentrations by the total (raw or dilute) flow from which it was  extracted during the test interval. This product is the total mass of  the emitted constituent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Combined sampling. You may use continuous and batch sampling  simultaneously during a test interval, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> You may use continuous sampling for some constituents and batch  sampling for others.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> You may use continuous and batch sampling for a single  constituent, with one being a redundant measurement. See Sec.  1065.201  for more information on redundant measurements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Work determination. Determine work over a test interval by one  of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Speed and torque. Synchronously multiply speed and brake torque  to calculate instantaneous values for engine brake power. Sum engine  brake power over a test interval to determine total work.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fuel consumed and brake-specific fuel consumption. Directly  measure fuel consumed or calculate it with chemical balances of the  fuel, intake air, and exhaust. To calculate fuel consumed by a chemical  balance, you must also measure either intake-air flow rate or exhaust  flow rate. Divide the fuel consumed during a test interval by the brake- specific fuel consumption to determine work over the test interval. For  laboratory testing, calculate the brake-specific fuel consumption using  fuel consumed and speed and torque over a test interval. For field  testing, refer to the standard-setting part and Sec.  1065.915 for  selecting an appropriate value for brake-specific fuel consumption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refer to Sec.  1065.650 for calculations to determine brake- specific emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following figure illustrates the allowed measurement  configurations described in this part 1065:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15SE11.019</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> This part 1065 describes how to test engines in a laboratory- type environment or in the field.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This affects test intervals and duty cycles as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For laboratory testing, you generally determine brake-specific  emissions for duty-cycle testing by using an engine dynamometer in a  laboratory or other environment. This typically consists of one or more  test intervals, each defined by a duty cycle, which is a sequence of  modes, speeds, and/or torques (or powers) that an engine must follow. If  the standard-setting part allows it, you may also simulate field testing  with an engine dynamometer in a laboratory or other environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Field testing consists of normal in-use engine operation while  an engine is installed in a vehicle, equipment, or vessel rather than  following a specific engine duty cycle. The standard-setting part  specifies how test intervals are defined for field testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of testing may also affect what test equipment may be  used. You may use ``lab-grade'' test equipment for any testing. The term  ``lab-grade'' refers to equipment that fully conforms to the applicable  specifications of this part. For some testing you may alternatively use  ``field-grade'' equipment. The term ``field-grade'' refers to equipment  that fully conforms to the applicable specifications of subpart J of  this part, but does not fully conform to other specifications of this  part. You may use ``field-grade'' equipment for field testing. We also  specify in this part and in the standard-setting parts certain cases in  which you may use ``field-grade'' equipment for testing in a laboratory- type environment. (Note: Although ``field-grade'' equipment is generally  more portable than ``lab-grade'' test equipment, portability is not  relevant to whether equipment is considered to be ``field-grade'' or  ``lab-grade''.)
