                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Social Security Administration provides facilities  for the public to file claims and to obtain assistance in completing  them. An appropriate application form and related forms for use in  filing a claim for monthly benefits, the establishment of a period of  disability, a lump-sum death payment, or entitlement to hospital  insurance benefits or supplementary medical insurance benefits can be  obtained from any district office, branch office, contact station, or  resident station of the Social Security Administration, from the  Division of Foreign Claims, Post Office Box 1756, Baltimore, MD 21203,  or from the Veteran's Administration Regional Office, Manila,  Philippines. See Sec. 404.614 of this chapter for offices at which  applications may be filed. See 42 CFR part 405, subpart A, for  conditions of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits and 42 CFR part  405, subpart B, for information relating to enrollment under the  supplementary medical insurance benefits program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission of evidence. An individual who files an application  for monthly benefits, the establishment of a period of disability, a  lump-sum death payment, or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits or  supplementary medical insurance benefits, either on his own behalf or on  behalf of another, must establish by satisfactory evidence the material  allegations in his application, except as to earnings shown in the  Social Security Administration's records (see subpart H of part 404 of  this chapter for evidence requirements in nondisability cases and  subpart P of part 404 of this chapter for evidence requirements in  disability cases). Instructions, report forms, and forms for the various  proofs necessary are available to the public in district   offices, branch offices, contact stations, and resident stations of the  Social Security Administration, and the Veteran's Administration  Regional Office, Manila, Philippines. These offices assist individuals  in preparing their applications and in obtaining the proofs required in  support of their applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determinations and notice to individuals. In the case of an  application for benefits, the establishment of a period of disability, a  lump-sum death payment, a recomputation of a primary insurance amount,  or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits or supplementary medical  insurance benefits, after obtaining the necessary evidence, we will  determine, based on the preponderance of the evidence (see Secs. 404.901  and 416.1401 of this chapter) as to the entitlement of the individual  claiming or for whom is claimed such benefits, and will notify the  applicant of the determination and of his right to appeal. Section  404.1503 of this chapter has a discussion of the respective roles of  State agencies and the Administration in the making of disability  determinations and information regarding initial determinations as to  entitlement or termination of entitlement in disability claims. See  section 1869(a) of the Social Security Act for determinations under the  health insurance for the aged program and sections 1816 and 1842 of the  Act for the role of intermediaries, carriers, and State agencies in  performing certain functions under such program, e.g., payment of claims  pursuant to an agreement with the Social Security Administration.
