                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method of collection. A debt will be collected in a lump sum or  by installment deductions at officially established pay intervals from  an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the  Commission agree in writing to alternate arrangements for repayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Source of deductions. Deductions will be made only from basic  pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay or in the  case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of deductions. Debts will be collected in one lump sum  when possible to minimize interest costs and administrative processing  fees for the employee. If the employee is financially unable to pay in  one lump sum and the amount of debt exceeds 15 percent of the employee's  disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection by  offset will be made in installments. Such installment deductions will be  made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of active  duty or employment of the employee and, except in rare circumstances,  not to exceed 3 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on amount of deductions. The size and frequency of  installment deductions will bear a reasonable relationship to the size  of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The amount deducted for  any period, however, will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay  from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in  writing to the deduction of a greater amount. Installment payments of  less than $25 will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When deductions may begin. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the employee files a timely  request for hearing, or a proposed voluntary repayment agreement,  deductions will begin in the next bi-weekly salary payment after a final  decision is issued on the request or repayment proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the employee fails to submit a timely request for hearing or  proposal for a voluntary repayment agreement, deductions will commence  in the next bi-weekly salary payment after the expiration of 30 days  following the employee's receipt of the Notice of Debt under  1650.105(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Lump-sum deduction from final check. When the employee retires,  resigns, or ends his or her period of active duty before the debt is  collected in   full, the employee's debt will be automatically deducted from the final  payments (e.g., final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.) due the  employee to the extent necessary to liquidate the debt. If the  employee's final pay is not sufficient to permit all deductions to be  made, the order of precedence for the deductions will be: Retirement and  FICA; Medicare; Federal income taxes; health benefits; group life  insurance; indebtedness due to the United States; State income taxes;  and voluntary deductions and allotments.</p>
