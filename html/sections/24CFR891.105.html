In the case of an individual residing in an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled that is assisted under title XIX of the Social Security Act and this part, the annual income of the individual shall exclude protected personal income as provided under that Act. For purposes of determining the total tenant payment, the income of such individuals shall be imputed to be the amount that the household would receive if assisted under title XVI of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth0">Family is defined in 24 CFR 5.403.</p><p class="depth0">Household (eligible household) means an elderly or disabled household (as defined in Sec. Sec. 891.205 or 891.305, respectively), as applicable, that meets the project occupancy requirements approved by HUD and, if the household occupies an assisted unit, meets the very low-income requirements described in Sec. 813.102 of this chapter, as modified by the definition of annual income in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Housing and related facilities means rental housing structures constructed, rehabilitated, or acquired as permanent residences for use by elderly or disabled households, as applicable.
