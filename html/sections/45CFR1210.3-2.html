                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Removal of a Volunteer from the project assignment may be requested and obtained by a written request supported by a statement of reason by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Governor or chief executive officer of the State or similar jurisdiction in which the Volunteer is assigned or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sponsoring organization. The sole responsibility for terminating or transferring a Volunteer rests with the ACTION Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request for removal of a Volunteer must be submitted to the ACTION State Director, who will in turn notify the Volunteer of the request. The State Director, after discussions with the Volunteer and in consultation with the Regional Director, if necessary, has 15 days to attempt to resolve the situation with the sponsor or the Governor's

office. If the situation is not resolved at the end of the 15 day period, the Volunteer will be removed from the project and placed on Administrative Hold, pending a decision as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The State office will take one of the following actions concerning a Volunteer who has been removed from a project assignment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accept the Volunteer's resignation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If removal was requested for reasons other than those listed in Sec. 1210.3-1, ACTION will attempt to place the Volunteer on another project. If reassignment is not possible, the Volunteer will be terminated for lack of suitable assignment, and he or she will be given special consideration for reinstatement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If removal from the project is approved based on any of the grounds for early termination as set forth in Sec. 1210.3-1, the Volunteer may appeal the termination grounds as detailed in subpart C of this part to establish whether such termination is supported by sufficient evidence. If ACTION determines that the removal based on grounds detailed in Sec. 1210.3-1 is not established by adequate evidence, then the procedures outlined in Sec. 1210.3-2(c)(2) will be followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Volunteer's removal during a term of service may also occur as a result of either the termination of, or refusal to renew, the Memorandum of Agreement between ACTION and the sponsoring organization, or the termination or completion of the initial Volunteer assignment. In such cases, the Volunteer will be placed in Administrative Hold status while the Regional Office attempts to reassign the Volunteer to another project. If no appropriate reassignment within the Region is found within the Administrative Hold period, the Volunteer will be terminated but will receive special consideration for reinstatement as soon as an appropriate assignment becomes available. If appropriate reassignment is offered the Volunteer and declined, ACTION has no obligation to offer additional or alternative assignments.</p>
