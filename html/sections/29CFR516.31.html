This handbook must remain in the possession of the homeworker except at the end of each pay period when it is to be submitted to the employer for transcription of the hours worked and other required information and for computation of wages to be paid. The handbooks shall include a provision for written verification by the employer attesting that the homeworker was instructed to accurately record all of the required information regarding such homeworker's employment, and that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the information was recorded accurately. Once no space remains in the handbook for additional entries, or upon termination of the homeworker's employment, the handbook shall be returned to the employer. The employer shall then preserve this handbook for at least two years and make it available for inspection by the Wage and Hour Division on request.
