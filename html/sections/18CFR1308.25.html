                            <p class="depth0">If an appeal has been taken because of a Contracting Officer's failure to render a timely decision, as provided by Sec. 1308.17, the Hearing Officer, with or without a motion by a party, may stay proceedings on the appeal in order to obtain a decision on the matter appealed. Oral argument will not be heard on such a motion unless otherwise directed. The stay order will normally set a date certain by which the decision of the Contracting Officer will be rendered. Such date shall take into account the factors mentioned in Sec. 1308.13(c), the length of time the matter has already been pending before the Contracting Officer, and the need for prompt and expeditious action on appeals.</p>
