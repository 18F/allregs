                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this part may be amended by the Secretary at any  time and from time to time, in whole or in part, but amendments to  subparts B and C of this part will not adversely affect the interests of  a mortgagee on any mortgage to be insured for which either the Direct  Endorsement mortgagee or Lender Insurance mortgagee has approved the  mortgagor and all terms and conditions of the mortgage, or the Secretary  has made a commitment to insure. Such amendments will not adversely  affect the interests of a mortgagor in the case of a default by a  mortgagee where the Secretary makes payments to the mortgagor.  [62 FR 30227, June 2, 1997]</p>
