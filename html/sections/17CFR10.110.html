                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appropriateness of restitution as a remedy. In any proceeding in  which an order requiring restitution may be entered, the Administrative  Law Judge shall, as part of his or her initial decision, determine  whether restitution is appropriate. In deciding whether restitution is  appropriate, the Administrative Law Judge, in his or her discretion, may  consider the degree of complexity likely to be involved in establishing  claims, the likelihood that claimants can obtain compensation through  their own efforts, the ability of the respondent to pay claimants  damages that his or her violations have caused, the availability of  resources to administer restitution and any other matters that justice  may require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restitution order. If the Administrative Law Judge determines  that restitution is an appropriate remedy in a proceeding, he or she  shall issue an order specifying the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All violations that form the basis for restitution;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The particular persons, or class or classes of persons, who  suffered damages proximately caused by each such violation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The method of calculating the amount of damages to be paid as  restitution; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If then determinable, the amount of restitution the respondent  shall be required to pay.</p>
