                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of the  terms of a contract, O&M; agreement, or other documents incorporated into  the contract, NRCS will give the participant notice and 60 days, unless  otherwise determined by the State Conservationist, to correct the  violation and comply with the terms of the contract and attachments  thereto. If a participant continues in violation, the State  Conservationist may terminate the AMA contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) of this section, a  contract termination will be effective immediately upon a determination  by the State Conservationist that the participant has submitted false  information or filed a false claim, or engaged in any act, scheme, or  device for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted  under the provisions of Sec. 1465.35, or in a case in which the actions  of the party involved are deemed to be sufficiently purposeful or  negligent to warrant a termination without delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant will forfeit all  rights to future payments under the contract and refund all or part of  the payments received, plus interest. Participants violating AMA  contracts may be determined ineligible for future NRCS-administered  conservation program funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State Conservationist may require only a partial refund of  the payments received if the State Conservationist determines that a  previously installed conservation practice can function independently  and is not affected by the violation or the absence of other   conservation practices that would have been installed under the  contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If NRCS terminates a contract due to breach of contract, or the  participant voluntarily terminates the contract before any contractual  payments have been made, the participant will forfeit all rights for  further payments under the contract and will pay such liquidated damages  as prescribed in the contract. The State Conservationist will have the  option to waive the liquidated damages depending upon the circumstances  of the case.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When making all contract termination decisions, NRCS may reduce  the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that  reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the  contract or the existence of hardships beyond the participant's control  that have prevented compliance with the contract. If the participant  claims hardship, that claim must be well documented and cannot have  existed when the applicant applied for participation in the program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The participant may voluntarily terminate a contract if NRCS  agrees based on NRCS' determination that termination is in the public  interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In carrying out NRCS' role in this section, NRCS may consult  with the local conservation district.</p>
