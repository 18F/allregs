If used, support blocks must contact only the filler material or partitions between the individual cells. At the test temperature range of 65 [deg]F -80 [deg]F (18.3 [deg]C-26.7 [deg]C), apply a dynamic force of 200 ft. lbs. to the following areas using a hemispherical weight with a 6 maximum radius:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The center of the two largest unsupported areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The areas above at least two support blocks, if used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The areas above at least two intercell connectors, one cell, and one filler cap; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Areas on at least two corners. If the design consists of both inside and outside corners, test one of each.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Record the condition of the covers, supports, intercell connectors, filler caps, cell covers, and filler material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable performance.
