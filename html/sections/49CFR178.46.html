The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure will not exceed 80 percent of the minimum yield strength nor exceed 67 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength as verified by physical tests in paragraph (i) of this section. The minimum wall thickness for any cylinder with an outside diameter greater than 5 inches must be 0.125 inch. Calculations must be made by the following formula:
S = [P(1.3D\2\ + 0.4d\2\)] / (D\2\ - d\2\)
Where:
S = Wall stress in psi;P = Prescribed minimum test pressure in psig (see paragraph (g) of this</p><p class="depth2">section);D = Outside diameter in inches; andd = Inside diameter in inches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Openings.

Shear stress must be calculated by using the appropriate thread shear area in accordance with NBS Handbook H-28.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Heat treatment. Prior to any test, all cylinders must be subjected to a solution heat treatment and aging treatment appropriate for the aluminum alloy used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must be subjected to an internal test pressure using the water jacket equipment and method or other suitable equipment and method and comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The testing apparatus must be operated in a manner so as to obtain accurate data.

The expansion gauge must permit reading the total expansion to an accuracy of either one percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test pressure must be maintained for a sufficient period of time to assure complete expansion of the cylinder. In no case may the pressure be held less than 30 seconds. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the required test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is lower. If the test apparatus again fails to maintain the test pressure, the cylinder being tested must be rejected. Any internal pressure applied to the cylinder before any official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The minimum test pressure is the greatest of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 450 psig regardless of service pressure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two times the service pressure for cylinders having service pressure less than 500 psig; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Five-thirds times the service pressure for cylinders having a service pressure of at least 500 psig.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Flattening test. One cylinder taken at random out of each lot must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test must be between knife edges, wedge shaped, having a 60 included angle, and rounded in accordance with the following table. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at an angle 90 to the knife edges during the test. The flattening test table is as follows:</p><p class="depth3">Table 3--Flattening Test Table------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Radius</p><p class="depth3">Cylinder wall thickness in inches                   in</p><p class="depth3">inches------------------------------------------------------------------------Under .150....................................................      .500.150 to .249..................................................      .875.250 to .349..................................................     1.500.350 to .449..................................................     2.125.450 to .549..................................................     2.750.550 to .649..................................................     3.500.650 to .749..................................................     4.125------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alternate bend test in accordance with ASTM E 290 using a mandrel diameter not more than 6 times the wall thickness is authorized to qualify lots that fail the flattening test of this section without reheat treatment. If used, this test must be performed on two samples from one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 cylinders or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each test cylinder must withstand flattening to nine times the wall thickness without cracking. When the alternate bend test is used, the test specimens must remain uncracked when bent inward around a mandrel in the direction of curvature of the cylinder wall until the interior edges are at a distance apart not greater than the diameter of the mandrel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Mechanical properties test. Two test specimens cut from one cylinder representing each lot of 200 cylinders or less must be subjected to the mechanical properties test, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The results of the test must conform to at least the minimum acceptable mechanical property limits for aluminum alloys as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specimens must be 4D bar or gauge length 2 inches with width not over 1\1/2\ inch taken in the direction of extrusion approximately 180 from each other; provided that gauge length at least 24 times thickness with width not over 6 times thickness is authorized, when cylinder wall is not over \3/16\ inch thick. The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section. When the size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows. When such specimens are used,

the inspector's report must show that the specimens were so taken and prepared. Heating of specimens for any purpose is forbidden.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The yield strength must be determined by either the ``offset'' method or the ``extension under load'' method as prescribed in ASTM B 557 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In using the ``extension under load'' method, the total strain (or ``extension under load'') corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 10,000,000 psi. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 6,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed \1/8\ inch per minute during yield strength determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Rejected cylinder. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized one time. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Duties of inspector. In addition to the requirements of Sec. 178.35, the inspector shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Verify compliance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performing or witnessing the performance of the chemical analyses on each melt or cast lot or other unit of starting material; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obtaining a certified chemical analysis from the material or cylinder manufacturer for each melt, or cast of material; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Obtaining a certified check analysis on one cylinder out of each lot of 200 cylinders or less, if a certificate containing data to indicate compliance with the material specification is obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The inspector must verify ultrasonic inspection of all material by inspection or by obtaining the material producer's certificate of ultrasonic inspection.
