                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In making an undue financial burden determination, the FTA  Administrator will consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effects on current fixed route service, including reallocation  of accessible fixed route vehicles and potential reduction in service,  measured by service miles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Average number of trips made by the entity's general population,  on a per capita basis, compared with the average number of trips to be  made by registered ADA paratransit eligible persons, on a per capita  basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reductions in other services, including other special services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Increases in fares;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Resources available to implement complementary paratransit  service over the period covered by the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Percentage of budget needed to implement the plan, both as a  percentage of operating budget and a percentage of entire budget;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The current level of accessible service, both fixed route and  paratransit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Cooperation/coordination among area transportation providers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Evidence of increased efficiencies, that have been or could be  effectuated, that would benefit the level and quality of available  resources for complementary paratransit service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Unique circumstances in the submitting entity's area that  affect the ability of the entity to provide paratransit, that militate  against the need to provide paratransit, or in some other respect create  a circumstance considered exceptional by the submitting entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Costs attributable to complementary paratransit shall be  limited to costs of providing service specifically required by this part  to ADA paratransit eligible individuals, by entities responsible under  this part for providing such service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the entity determines that it is impracticable to distinguish  between trips mandated by the ADA and other trips on a trip-by-trip  basis, the entity   shall attribute to ADA complementary paratransit requirements a  percentage of its overall paratransit costs. This percentage shall be  determined by a statistically valid methodology that determines the  percentage of trips that are required by this part. The entity shall  submit information concerning its methodology and the data on which its  percentage is based with its request for a waiver. Only costs  attributable to ADA-mandated trips may be considered with respect to a  request for an undue financial burden waiver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Funds to which the entity would be legally entitled, but which,  as a matter of state or local funding arrangements, are provided to  another entity and used by that entity to provide paratransit service  which is part of a coordinated system of paratransit meeting the  requirements of this part, may be counted in determining the burden  associated with the waiver request.
