                                Sec. 381.193  Poultry carcasses, etc., not intended for human food.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, poultry  carcasses, and parts and products thereof, that are not intended for use  as human food may, after they have been denatured as prescribed in Sec.  381.95, be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or  transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or  imported, even though they do not comply with all the provisions of the  regulations, provided they are marked ``Not fit for human food.'' These  requirements do not apply to parts of poultry carcasses that are  naturally inedible by humans, such as entrails.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) of  this section, no animal food processed, in whole or in part, from  materials derived from the carcasses of poultry in an official  establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered  for sale or transportation, or received for transportation in commerce,  or imported, unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is properly identified as animal food;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is not represented as being a human food; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It has been denatured as prescribed in Sec. 381.95 so as to  be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or  products of the carcasses of poultry and that is not represented by  labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a  product of the poultry industry need not be denatured in accordance with  Sec. 381.95.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed,  conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi- moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with Sec. 381.95  if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use  for animal food and appears on the label in a conspicuous manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b)(3) of this  section, the name of the article must be stated on the label as ``Animal  Food,'' ``Pet Food,'' or ``(name of species) Food'' (e.g., ``Dog Food''  or ``Cat Food''). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article,  wherever it appears on the label, must be stated in letters at least  twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in  the article of any ingredients derived from carcasses of poultry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, the article's name may be stated on the label to  show that it is or contains poultry carcass-source material and that the  article is for animals; e.g., ``Chicken for Pets'' or ``Turkey Dinner  for Cats'': Provided, That the entire name of the article is stated,  wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit,  whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters  denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as  high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material  derived from any poultry carcass. However, when the label bears on its  principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly  recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which  the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used  to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high,  wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other  letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry  carcass, but shall not be less than \1/8\ inch high. The letters used to  state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's  name by the vignette.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must  contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the  presence in the article of poultry carcass-source material contrast with  their background.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or  poultry feed manufactured from processed poultry byproducts (such as  poultry byproduct meal, hydrolyzed poultry feathers, and hydrolyzed  poultry byproducts aggregate), or to processed dry animal food.
