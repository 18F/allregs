                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This section describes the four steps that we follow to  calculate and apply your cohort default rate for a fiscal year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First, under paragraph (b) of this section, we identify the  borrowers in your cohort for the fiscal year. If the total number of  borrowers in that cohort is fewer than 30, we also identify the  borrowers in your cohorts for the 2 most recent prior fiscal years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second, under paragraph (c) of this section, we identify the  borrowers in the cohort (or cohorts) who are considered to be in  default. If more than one cohort will be used to calculate your cohort  default rate, we identify defaulted borrowers separately for each  cohort.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third, under paragraph (d) of this section, we calculate your  cohort default rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fourth, we apply your cohort default rate to all of your  locations--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As you exist on the date you receive the notice of your official  cohort default rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> From the date on which you receive the notice of your official  cohort default rate until you receive our notice that the cohort default  rate no longer applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identify the borrowers in a cohort. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, your cohort for a fiscal year consists  of all of your current and former students who, during that fiscal year,  entered repayment on any Federal Stafford loan, Federal SLS loan, Direct  Subsidized loan, or Direct Unsubsidized loan that they received to  attend your institution, or on the portion of a loan made under the  Federal Consolidation Loan Program or the Federal Direct Consolidation  Loan Program (as defined in 34 CFR 685.102) that is used to repay those  loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A borrower may be included in more than one of your cohorts and  may be included in the cohorts of more than one institution in the same  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A TEACH Grant that has been converted to a Federal Direct  Unsubsidized Loan is not considered for the purpose of calculating and  applying cohort default rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identify the borrowers in a cohort who are in default. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for the purposes  of this subpart a borrower in a cohort for a fiscal year is considered  to be in default if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower  defaults on any FFELP loan that was used to include the borrower in the  cohort or on any Federal Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a  loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort (however, a  borrower is not considered to be in default unless a claim for insurance  has been paid on the loan by a guaranty agency or by us);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower fails  to make an installment payment, when due, on any Direct Loan Program  loan that was used to include the borrower in the cohort or on any  Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program loan that repaid a loan that  was used to include the borrower in the cohort, and the borrower's  failure persists for 360 days (or for 270 days, if the borrower's first  day of delinquency was before October 7, 1998);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before the end of the following fiscal year, you or your  owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other affiliated entity or  individual make a payment to prevent a borrower's default on a loan that  is used to include the borrower in that cohort: or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Before the end of the following fiscal year, the borrower fails  to make an installment payment, when due, on a Federal Stafford Loan  that is held by the Secretary or a Federal Consolidation Loan that is  held by the Secretary and was used to repay a Federal Stafford Loan, if  such Federal Stafford Loan or Federal Consolidation Loan was used to  include the borrower in the   cohort, and the borrower's failure persists for 360 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A borrower is not considered to be in default based on a loan  that is, before the end of the fiscal year immediately following the  fiscal year in which it entered repayment--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rehabilitated under 34 CFR 682.405 or 34 CFR 685.211(e); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repurchased by a lender because the claim for insurance was  submitted or paid in error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Calculate the cohort default rate. Except as provided in Sec.   668.184, if there are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Thirty or more borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your  cohort default rate is the percentage that is derived by dividing--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of borrowers in the cohort who are in default, as  determined under paragraph (c) of this section; by</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of borrowers in the cohort, as determined under  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fewer than 30 borrowers in your cohort for a fiscal year, your  cohort default rate is the percentage that is derived by dividing--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total number of borrowers in that cohort and in the two most  recent prior cohorts who are in default, as determined for each cohort  under paragraph (c) of this section; by</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total number of borrowers in that cohort and the two most  recent prior cohorts, as determined for each cohort under paragraph (b)  of this section.
