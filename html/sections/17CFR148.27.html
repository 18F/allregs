The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on  the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an  explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount  requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at  issue, findings on whether the Commission's position was substantially  justified, whether the applicant unduly or unreasonably protracted the  adjudicatory proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award  unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one  agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any  award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the  allocation made.</p>
