                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When to file a statement of use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In an application under  section 1(b) of the Act, a statement of use, required under section 1(d)  of the Act, must be filed within six months after issuance of a notice  of allowance under section 13(b)(2) of the Act, or within an extension  of time granted under Sec.  2.89. A statement of use filed prior to  issuance of a notice of allowance is premature and will not be reviewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a trademark, service mark, collective trademark,  collective service mark, and certification mark, a statement of use may  be filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce on or in  connection with all the goods or services specified in the notice of  allowance for which the applicant will seek registration in that  application. For a collective membership mark, a statement of use may be  filed only when the mark has been in use in commerce to indicate  membership in the collective membership organization specified in the  notice of allowance for which the applicant will seek registration in  that application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of use may be accompanied by a request in  accordance with Sec.  2.87 to divide out from the application the goods,  services, or classes not yet in use in commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A complete statement of use. A complete statement of use must  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A verified statement alleging:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant believes the applicant is the owner of the mark;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mark is in use in commerce;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date of first use of the mark anywhere on or in connection  with the goods, services, and/or to indicate membership in the  collective organization specified in the application, and the date of  first use of the mark in commerce. If the statement of use specifies  more than one item of goods or services in a class, the dates of use are  required for only one item of goods or services specified in that class;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The goods, services, and/or nature of the collective membership  organization specified in the notice of allowance. The goods or services  specified in a statement of use must conform to those goods or services  specified in the notice of allowance for trademark, service mark,  collective trademark, collective service mark, or certification mark  applications. Any goods or services specified in the notice of allowance  that are omitted from the identification of goods or services in the  statement of use will be presumed to be deleted and the deleted goods or  services may not be reinserted in the application. For collective  membership mark applications,   the description of the nature of the collective membership organization  in the statement of use must conform to that specified in the notice of  allowance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For a collective mark and certification mark, the applicant is  exercising legitimate control over the use in commerce of the mark;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One specimen showing how the applicant, member, or authorized  user uses the mark in commerce. See Sec.  2.56 for the requirements for  specimens;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fee(s). The fee required by Sec.  2.6 per class. The applicant  must pay a filing fee sufficient to cover at least one class within the  statutory time for filing the statement of use, or the application will  be abandoned. If the applicant submits a fee insufficient to cover all  the classes in a multiple-class application, the applicant should  specify the classes to be abandoned. If the applicant timely submits a  fee sufficient to pay for at least one class, but insufficient to cover  all the classes, and the applicant has not specified the class(es) to be  abandoned, the Office will issue a notice granting the applicant  additional time to submit the fee(s) for the remaining class(es) or to  specify the class(es) to be abandoned. If the applicant does not submit  the required fee(s) or specify the class(es) to be abandoned within the  set time period, the Office will apply the fees paid, beginning with the  lowest numbered class, in ascending order. The Office will delete the  class(es) not covered by the fees submitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)(A)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For a certification mark, the requirements of Sec.   2.45(a)(4)(i)(A) through (C); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The title ``Statement of Use'' should appear at the top of the  first page of the document, if not filed through TEAS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum filing requirements for a timely filed statement of use.  The Office will review a timely filed statement of use to determine  whether it meets the following minimum requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fee required by Sec.  2.6 for at least one class;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One specimen of the mark as used in commerce; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The verified statement in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.  If this verified statement is unsigned or signed by the wrong party, the  applicant must submit a substitute verified statement on or before the  statutory deadline for filing the statement of use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deficiency notification. If the statement of use is filed within  the permitted time period but does not meet the minimum requirements  specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Office will notify the  applicant of the deficiency. If the time permitted for the applicant to  file a statement of use has not expired, the applicant may correct the  deficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification of refusals and requirements. A timely filed  statement of use that meets the minimum requirements specified in  paragraph (c) of this section will be examined in accordance with  Sec. Sec.  2.61 through 2.69. If, as a result of the examination of the  statement of use, the applicant is found not entitled to registration,  the applicant will be notified and advised of the reasons and of any  formal requirements or refusals. The statement of use may be amended in  accordance with Sec. Sec.  2.59 and 2.71 through 2.75.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Statement of use may not be withdrawn. The applicant may not  withdraw a timely filed statement of use to return to the previous  status of awaiting submission of a statement of use, regardless of  whether it is in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Verification not filed within reasonable time. If the verified  statements in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and, if applicable, (b)(1)(v) of  this section are not filed within a reasonable time after they are  signed, the Office may require the applicant to submit substitute  verified statements attesting that the mark is in use in commerce, and,  if applicable, the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the  use of the mark in commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Amending the application. The statement of use may include  amendments in accordance with Sec. Sec.  2.51, 2.59, and 2.71 through  2.75.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Concurrent use. If the application is amended to concurrent use  under Sec.  2.73, the statement of use must include a verified statement  modified in accordance with Sec.  2.33(f), Sec.  2.44(d), or Sec.   2.45(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Multiple-class application. For the requirements of a multiple- class application, see Sec.  2.86.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Abandonment. The failure to timely file a statement of use which  meets the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this  section shall result in the abandonment of the application.</p>
