These proceedings are  commenced by the issuance of a determination by the Director, Office of  Carrier, Driver, and Vehicle Safety Standards (MC-PS), in a case arising  under Sec. 391.47 of this chapter or by the issuance of a letter of  disqualification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such determination and letters must be accompanied by the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A citation of the regulation under which the action is being  taken;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of all documentary evidence relied on or considered in  taking such action, or in the case of voluminous evidence a summary of  such evidence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notice to the driver and motor carrier involved in the case  that they may petition for review of the action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Notice that a hearing will be granted if the Assistant  Administrator determines there are material factual issues in dispute;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Notice that failure to petition for review will constitute a  waiver of the right to contest the action; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Notice that the burden or proof will be on the petitioner in  cases arising under Sec. 391.47 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At any time before the close of hearing, upon application of a  party, the letter or determination may be amended at the discretion of  the administrative law judge upon such terms as he/she approves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of Violation. The Agency may issue a Notice of Violation  as a means of notifying any person subject to the rules in this part  that it has received information (i.e., from an investigation, audit, or  any other source) wherein it has been alleged the person has violated  provisions of the FMCSRs, HMRs, or FMCCRs. The Notice of Violation  serves as an informal mechanism to address compliance deficiencies. If  the alleged deficiency is not addressed to the satisfaction of the  Agency, formal enforcement action may be taken in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section. A Notice of Violation is not a  prerequisite to the issuance of a Notice of Claim. The Notice of  Violation will address the following issues, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific alleged violations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any specific actions the Agency determines are appropriate to  remedy the identified problems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The means by which the notified person can inform the Agency  that it has received the Notice of Violation and either has addressed  the alleged violation or does not agree with the Agency's assertions in  the Notice of Violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other relevant information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Civil penalty proceedings. These proceedings are commenced by  the issuance of a Notice of Claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each Notice of Claim must contain the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement setting forth the facts alleged.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the provisions of law allegedly violated by the  respondent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The proposed civil penalty and notice of the maximum amount  authorized to be claimed under statute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The time, form, and manner whereby the respondent may pay,  contest, or otherwise seek resolution of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of  this section, the Notice of Claim may contain such other matters as the  Agency deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In proceedings for collection of civil penalties for violations  of the motor carrier safety regulations under the Motor Carrier Safety  Act of 1984, the Agency may require the respondent to post a copy of the  Notice of Claim in such place or places and for such duration as the  Agency may determine appropriate to aid in the enforcement of the law  and regulations.
