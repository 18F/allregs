                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Secretary shall review all Requests for Proprietary  Treatment from the GSEs, along with any other information that the  Secretary may elicit from other sources regarding the Request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Factors for proprietary treatment. Except as provided in  paragraph (c) of this section, in making the determination of whether to  accord proprietary treatment to mortgage data or AHAR information, the  Secretary's considerations shall include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The type of data or information involved and the nature of the  adverse consequences to the GSE, financial or otherwise, that would  result from disclosure, including any adverse effect on the GSE's  competitive position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The existence and applicability of any prior determinations by  HUD, any other Federal agency, or a court, concerning similar data or  information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The measures taken by the GSE to protect the confidentiality of  the mortgage data or AHAR information in question, and similar data or  information, before and after its submission to the Secretary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which the mortgage data or AHAR information is  publicly available including whether the data or information is  available from other entities, from local government offices or records,  including deeds, recorded mortgages, and similar documents, or from  publicly available data bases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The difficulty that a competitor, including a seller/servicer,  would face   in obtaining or compiling the mortgage data or AHAR information; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Such additional facts and legal and other authorities as the  Secretary may consider appropriate, including the age of the mortgage  data (see 24 CFR 81.75(b)(3)), or the extent to which particular  mortgage data or AHAR information, when considered together with other  information, could reveal proprietary information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative criterion for mortgage data or AHAR information  subject to a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect.  Where the request for proprietary treatment pertains to mortgage data or  AHAR information that has been deemed proprietary by the Secretary under  a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect, the Secretary  shall grant the request with respect to any mortgage data or AHAR  information which comes within the order or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of proprietary treatment. The Secretary shall  determine, as expeditiously as possible, whether mortgage data or AHAR  information designated as proprietary by a GSE is proprietary  information, or whether it is not proprietary and subject to inclusion  in the public-use database and public release notwithstanding the GSE's  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Action when according proprietary treatment to mortgage data and  AHAR information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Secretary determines that mortgage data  or AHAR information designated as proprietary by a GSE is proprietary,  and the mortgage data or AHAR information is not subject to a temporary  order, a final order, or a regulation in effect providing that the  mortgage data or AHAR information is not subject to public disclosure,  the Secretary shall notify the GSE that the request has been granted. In  such cases, the Secretary shall issue either a temporary order, a final  order, or a regulation providing that the mortgage data or information  is not subject to public disclosure. Such a temporary order, final  order, or regulation shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Document the reasons for the determination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be provided to the GSE, made available to members of the  public, and published in the Federal Register, except that any portions  of such order or regulation that would reveal the proprietary  information shall be withheld from public disclosure. Publications of  temporary orders shall invite public comments when feasible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the Secretary determines that such mortgage data or  information is proprietary, the Secretary shall not make it publicly  available, except as otherwise provided in accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination not to accord proprietary treatment to mortgage  data and AHAR information or to seek further information. When the  Secretary determines that such mortgage data or AHAR information  designated as proprietary by a GSE may not be proprietary, that the  request may be granted only in part, or that questions exist concerning  the request, the following procedure shall apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary shall provide the GSE with an opportunity for a  meeting with HUD to discuss the matter, for the purpose of gaining  additional information concerning the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following the meeting, based on the Secretary's review of the  mortgage data or AHAR information that is the subject of a request and  the GSE's objections, if any, to disclosure of such mortgage data or  AHAR information, the Secretary shall make a determination:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Secretary determines to withhold from the public-use  database as proprietary the mortgage data or AHAR information that is  the subject of a request, the procedures in paragraph (e) of this  section shall apply; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the Secretary determines that any mortgage data or AHAR  information that is the subject of a request is not proprietary, the  Secretary shall provide notice in writing to the GSE of the reasons for  this determination, and such notice shall provide that the Secretary  shall not release the mortgage data or AHAR information to the public  for 10 working days.
