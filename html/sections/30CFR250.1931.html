                                Sec.  250.1931  What must be included in my SEMS program for UWA?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your SEMS program must have a process to identify the individual  with the UWA on your facility(ies). You must designate this individual  taking into account all applicable USCG regulations that deal with  designating a person in charge of an OCS facility. Your SEMS program  must clearly define who is in charge at all times. In the event that  multiple facilities, including a MODU, are attached and working together  or in close proximity to one another to perform an OCS operation, your  SEMS program must identify the individual with the UWA over the entire  operation, including all facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must ensure that all personnel clearly know who has UWA and  who is in charge of a specific operation or activity at all times,  including when that responsibility shifts to a different individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The SEMS program must provide that if an emergency occurs that  creates an imminent risk or danger to the health or safety of an  individual, the public, or to the environment (as specified in Sec.   250.1930(a)), the individual with the UWA is authorized to pursue the  most effective action necessary in that individual's judgment for  mitigating and abating the conditions or practices causing the  emergency.
