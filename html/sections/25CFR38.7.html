                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Local school employees. Local Bureau school employees shall be  appointed only by the school supervisor. Before the local school  employee is employed, the school board shall be consulted. An  individual's appointment may be finalized only upon receipt of a formal  written determination certified by the local school board under such  uniform procedures as it may adopt.   Written determination by the school board should be received within a  reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school  board to act within this period shall have the effect of approving the  proposed appointment. The local school board shall use the same written  procedure to disapprove an appointment. The school supervisor may appeal  to the ASE, or, where appropriate, to the AEPA, any determination by the  local school board concerning an individual's appointment. A written  statement of appeal describing the action and the reasons the supervisor  believes such action should be overturned must be filed within 10 days  of receipt of the action from the local school board. A copy of such  statement shall be submitted to the school board and the board shall be  afforded an opportunity to respond, not to exceed 10 calendar days, in  writing, to the appeal. After reviewing such written appeal and  response, the ASE or AEPA may, for cause, overturn the action of the  local school board. The ASE or AEPA must transmit the determination of  the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the  supervisor identifying the reasons for overturning the action within 10  calender days. Failure to act within the 10 calendar day period shall  have the effect of approving the local school board's determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> School supervisors. School supervisors may be appointed only by  the ASE, except the AEPA shall appoint school supervisors for off- reservation boarding schools and those few other schools supervised by  the AEPA. The school board shall be consulted before the school  supervisor is employed. The appointment may be finalized upon receipt of  a formal written determination certified by the school board under any  uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school  board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30  days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have  the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The school board shall  use the same procedure to disapprove an appointment. Within 20 calendar  days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an  individual's appointment, the ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, may appeal to  the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination  and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be  overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the local  school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond,  within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such an appeal. The Director may  reverse the determination for cause set out in writing to the school  board. Within 20 calendar days of the school board's response, the  Director shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of  a written opinion) to the board and to the ASE or AEPA identifying the  reasons for overturning the determination. Failure by the Director to  act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving  the school board's determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency office education program employees. Appointments to  Agency office education positions may be made only by the ASE. The  Agency school board shall be consulted before the agency education  employee is employed, and the appointment may be finalized upon receipt  of a formal, written determination certified by the Agency school board  under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by  the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not  to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period  shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The Agency  school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an  appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by  the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE may  appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the  determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination  should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the  Agency school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to  respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such appeal. After  reviewing the written appeal and response, the Director may, for cause,  overturn the determination of the Agency school board.   Within 20 days of the board's response, the Director shall transmit the  determination of the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the  board and to the ASE identifying the reasons for overturning the  determination. Failure of the Director to act within the 20 calendar day  period shall have the effect of approving the school's board's  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employment contracts. The Bureau shall issue employment  contracts each year for individuals employed in contract education  positions at the Agency or school levels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Absence of local school boards. Where a local school board has  not been established in accordance with section 1139(7) Pub. L. 95-561  with respect to a Bureau school, or where a school board is not  operational, and the local school board is required to be given a notice  or required to be consulted by statute or these regulations, the  official involved shall notify or consult with the Agency school board  serving the tribe(s) to which the parents of the Indian children  atending that school belong, or, in that absence, the tribal  organization(s) of the tribe(s) involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Provisional contracts. Provisional certification or other  limited certificates from the State are not considered full  certification and only a provisional contract may be issued. There may  be circumstances when no individual who has met the full certification  or experience requirements is available for a professional position or  when a status quo employee who does not meet full certification or  experience requirements desires to convert to contract. When this  situation exists, a provisional contract may be issued in accordance  with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contract will be made only:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After it is determined that an individual already meeting  certification or experience requirements is not available; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For conversion of a status quo employee who does not yet meet  all established position requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consultation with the appropriate school board is required prior  to the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contract may be of 12-month or school-term duration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The employee will be required to make satisfactory progress  toward meeting full qualification requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the employee fails to meet the requirements established under  Sec. 38.7(f)(4), the contract will be terminated. Such termination  cannot be grieved or appealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conditional appointment. As provided in section 1131(d)(4), Pub.  L. 95-561, if an individual who has applied at both the national and  local levels is appointed from a local list of applicants, the  appointment shall be conditional for 90 days. During that period, the  individual's application and background shall be examined to determine  if there is a more qualified individual for the position. Removal during  this period is not subject to discharge, hearing or grievance  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Short-term contracts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There may be circumstances where  immediate action is necessary and it is impossible to consult with the  local school board. When this situation exists short-term contracts may  be made by the school supervisor in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The length of the contract will not exceed 60 days, or the next  regularly scheduled school board meeting, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the board meets and does not take action on the individual  in question, the short-term contract may be extended for the duration of  the school year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It shall be the responsibility of the school supervisor to  fully inform the local school board of all such short-term contracts.  Failure to do so may be cited as reason to discharge the school  supervisor if so requested by the board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The local school board may authorize the school supervisor to  make an emergency short-term contract to classroom, dormitory and other  positions directly related to the health and safety of students. When  this situation exists, short-term contracts may be made in accordance  with the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If local and agency lists of qualified applicants are exhausted,  short-term contracts may be made without regard to qualifications for  the position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pay level will be based on the qualifications of the  individual employed rather than the requirements of the position, if the  qualifications of the individual are lower than required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The short-term contract may not exceed the school term and may  not be renewed or extended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Every 60 days the school supervisor will determine if qualified  individuals have been placed on the local or agency lists. If a  qualified individual on the list accepts employment, the school  supervisor must terminate the emergency appointment at the time the  qualified individual is appointed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Temporary contracts. There may be circumstances where a specific  position is needed for a period of one year or less. Under these  conditions a position may be advertised as a temporary position and be  filled under a temporary contract. Such contract requires the same  school board approval as a school year contract. If required for the  completion of the activities specified in the original announcement, the  position, may with school board approval be extended for up to one  additional year. Temporary contracts may be terminated at any time and  this action is not subject to approval or grievance procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Waiver of Indian preference. Notwithstanding any provision of  the Indian preference laws, such laws shall not apply in the case of any  personnel action within the purview of this section respecting an  application or employee not entitled to Indian preference if each tribal  organization concerned grants, in writing, a waiver of the application  of such laws with respect to such personnel action, where such a waiver  is in writing deemed to be a necessity by the tribal organization,  except that this shall in no way relieve the Bureau of its  responsibility to issue timely and adequate announcements and  advertisements concerning any such personnel action if it is intended to  fill a vacancy (no matter how such vacancy is created). When a waiver is  granted, it shall apply only to that particular position and as long as  the employee remains in that position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Prohibited reappointment. An educator who voluntarily terminates  employment before the end of the school term may not be appointed to  another Bureau education position before the beginning of the following  school term. An educator will not be deemed to have voluntarily  terminated employment if transferred elsewhere with the consent of the  local school or Agency boards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Contract renewals. The appropriate school board shall be  notified in writing by the school supervisor and/or ASE or AEPA not less  than 90 days before the end of the school term whether or not an  individual's contract is recommended for renewal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the school board disagrees with the school supervisor's or  ASE's or AEPA's recommendations, the board will submit a formal, written  certification of its determinations to the school supervisor or ASE or  AEPA within 25 days. If the board's determinations are not received  within the 25 days, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA shall issue the  60 day notification of renewal or nonrenawal to the individual as  required under Sec. 38.8.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the school board submits its determination within the 25  days and determines that a contract will be renewed, or nonrenewed, the  appropriate official shall issue the required renewal notice, or  nonrenawal, or appeal the determination of the school board to the  appropriate official who will make a determination in accordance with  the appeal procedure is Sec. 38.7(a) of this part. After the  probationary period, if the determination is that the contract will not  be renewed, the procedures specified in Sec. 38.8 shall apply.</p>
