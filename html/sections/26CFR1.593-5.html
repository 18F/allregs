                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> for specific debts which become worthless in  whole or in part, a thrift institution is allowed a deduction under  section 166(c) for a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts. In  the case of a thrift institution, the amount of the reasonable addition  to such reserve for a taxable year may not exceed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For taxable years beginning after July 11, 1969, the sum of (i)  the amount determined to be the reasonable addition to the reserve for  losses on nonqualifying loans, determined in the same manner as is  provided with respect to additions to the reserve for losses on  qualifying real property loans under paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.593-6A  (relating to the experience method), and (ii) the amount determined  under Sec. 1.593-6A to be the reasonable addition to the reserve for  losses on qualifying real property loans, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For taxable years beginning before July 12, 1969, the sum of (i)  the amount determined under Sec. 1.166-4 to be the reasonable addition  to the reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans, and (ii) the amount  determined under Sec. 1.593-6 to be the reasonable addition to the  reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crediting to reserves required--(1) In general. The amounts  referred to in paragraph (a) </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and (2) of this section must be  credited, respectively, to the reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans  and to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans by the  close of the taxable year, or as soon as practicable thereafter. For  rules with respect to accounting for such reserves see paragraph (a)(2)  of Sec. 1.593-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent adjustments. If an adjustment with respect to the  income tax return for a taxable year is made, and if such adjustment  (whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Commissioner) has the effect  of permitting an increase, or requiring a reduction, in the amount  claimed on such return as an addition to the reserve for losses on  nonqualifying loans or to the reserve for losses on qualifying real  property loans, then the amount initially credited to such reserve for  such year pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may have to be  increased or decreased, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to  reflect such adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transition year. For rules governing the computation of taxable  income in the case of a taxable year beginning in 1962 and ending in  1963, see Sec. 1.593-9.
