                            <p class="depth0">For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler with respect to each of the handler's pool plants and of each handler described in Sec. 1000.9(c) with respect to milk that was not received at a pool plant by adding the amounts computed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in paragraph (f) of this section. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another Federal order under Sec. 1000.76(a)(4) or (d) shall be excluded from pricing under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in producer milk that were classified in each class pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(c) by the applicable skim milk and butterfat prices, and add the resulting amounts; except that for the months of January 2005 through March 2005, the Class I skim milk price for this purpose shall be the Class I skim milk price as determined in Sec. 1000.50(b)

plus $0.04 per hundredweight, and the Class I butterfat price for this purpose shall be the Class I butterfat price as determined in Sec. 1000.50(c) plus $0.0004 per pound. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein may be reduced by the market administrator for any month if the market administrator determines that the payments yet unpaid computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) and paragraph (g)(7) of this section will be less than the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section. The adjustments to the Class I skim milk and butterfat prices provided herein during the months of January 2005 through March 2005 shall be announced along with the prices announced in Sec. 1000.53(b);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiply the pounds of skim milk and butterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(11) by the respective skim milk and butterfat prices applicable at the location of the pool plant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiply the difference between the Class IV price for the preceding month and the current month's Class I, II, or III price, as the case may be, by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I, II, or III, respectively, pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(7) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Multiply the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.43(d) and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(3)(i) through (vi) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b), excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated under other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, plants regulated under other Federal orders, and unregulated supply plants;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multiply the Class I skim milk and Class I butterfat prices applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.43(d) and Sec. 1000.44(a)(3)(i) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(a)(8) and the corresponding step of Sec. 1000.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to Sec. 1000.43(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For the months of January 2005 through March 2005 for handlers who have submitted proof satisfactory to the market administrator to determine eligibility for reimbursement of transportation costs, subtract an amount equal to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of transportation on loads of producer milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of transportation on loads of producer milk delivered or rerouted to a pool supply plant that was then transferred to a pool distributing plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant from a pool supply plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted to a pool distributing plant from another order plant which were delivered as a result of hurricanes

Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The cost of transportation on loads of bulk milk transferred or diverted to a plant regulated under another Federal order or to other nonpool plants which were delivered as a result of hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The total amount of payment to all handlers under this section shall be limited for each month to an amount determined by multiplying the total Class I producer milk for all handlers pursuant to Sec. 1000.44(c) times $0.04 per hundredweight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the cost of transportation computed pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section exceeds the amount computed pursuant to paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the market administrator shall prorate such payments to each handler based on the handler's proportion of transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section. Transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section which are not paid as a result of such a proration shall be included in each subsequent month's transportation costs submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section until paid, or until the time period for such payments is concluded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to this section shall be the actual demonstrated cost of such transportation of bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section, or the miles of transportation on loads of bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section multiplied by $2.25 per loaded mile, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> For each handler, the reimbursement of transportation costs pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section for bulk milk delivered or rerouted as described in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section shall be reduced by the amount of payments received for such milk movements from the transportation credit balancing fund pursuant to Sec. 1005.82.
