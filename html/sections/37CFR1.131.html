                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When any claim of an application or a patent under reexamination is rejected, the applicant or patent owner may submit an appropriate oath or declaration to establish invention of the subject matter of the rejected claim prior to the effective date of the reference or activity on which the rejection is based. The effective date of a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or international application publication under PCT Article 21(2) is the earlier of its publication date or the date that it is effective as a reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) as in effect on March 15, 2013. Prior invention may not be established under this section in any country other than the United States, a NAFTA country, or a WTO member country. Prior invention may not be established under this section before December 8, 1993, in a NAFTA country other than the United States, or before January 1, 1996, in a WTO member country other than a NAFTA country. Prior invention may not be established under this section if either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rejection is based upon a U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication of a pending or patented application naming another inventor which claims interfering subject matter as defined in Sec.  41.203(a) of this chapter, in which case an applicant may suggest an interference pursuant to Sec.  41.202(a) of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rejection is based upon a statutory bar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The showing of facts for an oath or declaration under paragraph (a) of this section shall be such, in character and weight, as to establish reduction to practice prior to the effective date of the reference, or conception of the invention prior to the effective date of the reference coupled with due diligence from prior to said date to a subsequent reduction to practice or to the filing of the application. Original exhibits of drawings or records, or photocopies thereof, must accompany and form part of the affidavit or declaration or their absence must be satisfactorily explained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When any claim of an application or a patent under reexamination is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as in effect on March 15, 2013, on a U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication which is not prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as in effect on March 15, 2013, and the inventions defined by the claims in the application or patent under reexamination and by the claims in the patent or published application are not identical but are not patentably distinct, and the inventions are owned by the same party, the applicant or owner of the patent under reexamination may disqualify the patent or patent application publication as prior art. The patent or patent application publication can be disqualified as prior art by submission of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A terminal disclaimer in accordance with Sec.  1.321(c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An oath or declaration stating that the application or patent under reexamination and patent or published application are currently owned by the same party, and that the inventor named in the application or patent under reexamination is the prior inventor under 35 U.S.C. 104 as in effect on March 15, 2013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this section apply to any application for patent and to any patent issuing thereon, that contains, or contained at any time:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A claim to an invention that has an effective filing date as defined in Sec.  1.109 that is before March 16, 2013; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A specific reference under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, 365(c), or 386(c) to any patent or application that contains, or contained at any time, a claim to an invention that has an effective filing date as defined in Sec.  1.109 that is before March 16, 2013.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In an application for patent to which the provisions of Sec.  1.130 apply, and to any patent issuing thereon, the provisions of this section are applicable only with respect to a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102(g) as in effect on March 15, 2013.
