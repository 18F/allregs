                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. This section sets forth those persons who, by the  provisions of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, and the NATO Status of Forces  Agreement, are eligible for CHAMPUS benefits. A determination that a  person is eligible does not automatically entitle such a person to  CHAMPUS payments. Before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended,  additional requirements, as set forth in other sections of this part,  must be met. Additionally, the use of CHAMPUS may be denied if a  Uniformed Service medical treatment facility capable of providing the  needed care is available. CHAMPUS relies primarily on the Defense  Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) for eligibility  verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> CHAMPUS eligibles--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Retiree.

If the child was not incapacitated after that date, no CHAMPUS  eligibility exists on the basis of the incapacity.

class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Retirees and their dependents are not eligible for benefits  under the Extended Care Health Option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Dual eligibility. Dual eligibility occurs when a person is  entitled to benefits from two sources. For example, when an active duty  member is also the dependent of another active duty member, a retiree,  or a deceased active duty member or retiree, dual eligibility, that is,  entitlement to direct care from the Uniformed Services medical care  system and CHAMPUS is the result. Since the active duty status is  primary, and it is the intent that all medical care be provided an  active duty member through the Uniformed Services medical care system,  CHAMPUS eligibility is terminated as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following  the day the dual eligibility begins. However, any dependent children in  a marriage of two active duty persons or of an active duty member and a  retiree, are CHAMPUS eligible in the same manner as dependent children  of a marriage involving only one CHAMPUS sponsor. Should a spouse or  dependent who has dual eligibility leave active duty status, that  person's CHAMPUS   eligibility is reinstated as of 12:01 a.m. of the day active duty ends,  if he or she otherwise is eligible as a dependent of a CHAMPUS sponsor.</p><p class="depth0">Note: No CHAMPUS eligibility arises as the result of the marriage of  two active duty members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Eligibility under the Transitional Assistance Management Program  (TAMP). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A member of the armed forces is eligible for transitional  health care if the member is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A member who is involuntarily separated from active duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A member of a Reserve component who is separated from active  duty to which called or ordered in support of a contingency operation if  the active duty is active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive  days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A member who is separated from active duty for which the  member is involuntarily retained under 10 U.S.C. 12305 in support of a  contingency operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A member who is separated from active duty served pursuant to a  voluntary agreement of the member to remain on active duty for a period  of less than 1 year in support of a contingency operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A member who receives a sole survivorship discharge (as defined  in section 1174(i) of this title).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A member who is separated from Active Duty who agrees to become  a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of a reserve  component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em>  of this section) of a member described in paragraph (e)(1) of this  section is also eligible for TAMP benefits under TRICARE.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> TAMP benefits under TRICARE begin on the day after the member is  separated from active duty, and, if such separation occurred on or after  November 6, 2003, end 180 days after such date. TRICARE benefits  available to both the member and eligible family members are generally  those available to family members of members of the uniformed services  under this Part. However, during TAMP eligibility, a member of a Reserve  Component as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is  entitled to dental care to which a member of the uniformed services on  active duty for more than 30 days is entitled. Each branch of service  will determine eligibility for its members and eligible family members  and provide data to DEERS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Changes in status which result in termination of CHAMPUS  eligibility. Changes in status which result in a loss of CHAMPUS  eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the event  occurred, unless otherwise indicated, are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Changes in the status of a member. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When an active duty  member's period of active duty ends, excluding retirement or death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When an active duty member is placed on desertion status  (eligibility is reinstated when the active duty member is removed from  desertion status and returned to military control).</p><p class="depth0">Note: A member serving a sentence of confinement in conjunction with  a sentence of punitive discharge is still considered on active duty  until such time as the discharge is executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changes in the status of a retiree. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When a retiree ceases to  be entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay for any reason, the  retiree's dependents lose their eligibility unless the dependent is  otherwise eligible (e.g., some former spouses, some dependents who are  victims of abuse and some incapacitated children as outlined in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A retiree also loses eligibility when no longer entitled to  retired, retainer, or equivalent pay.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A retiree who waives his or her retired, retainer or  equivalent pay is still considered a retiree for the purposes of CHAMPUS  eligibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part  A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii),  (f)(3)(viii) and (f)(3)(ix) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes in the status of a dependent.

The stepchild continues CHAMPUS eligibility  as other classes of dependent children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part  A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii),  (f)(3)(viii), and (f)(3)(ix) of this section. (This also applies to  individuals living outside the United States where Medicare benefits are  not available.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Attainment of age 65, except for dependents of active duty  members, beneficiaries not entitled to part A of Medicare, beneficiaries  entitled to Part A of Medicare who have enrolled in Part B of Medicare,  and as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For those who do  not retain CHAMPUS, CHAMPUS eligibility is lost at 12:01 a.m. on the  first day of the month in which the beneficiary becomes entitled to  Medicare.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the person is not eligible for Part A of Medicare, he or  she must file a Social Security Administration, ``Notice of  Disallowance'' certifying to that fact with the Uniformed Service  responsible for the issuance of his or her identification card so a new  card showing CHAMPUS eligibility can be issued. Individuals entitled  only to supplementary medical insurance (Part B) of Medicare, but not  Part A, or Part A through the Premium HI provisions (provided for under  the 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act) retain eligibility under  CHAMPUS (refer to Sec. 199.8 for additional information when a double  coverage situation is involved).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> End stage renal disease. All beneficiaries, except dependents  of active duty members, lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare  coverage becomes available to a person because of chronic renal disease  unless the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will  continue if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual is under 65 years old;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions  of 42 U.S.C. 426-1(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS  eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System  (DEERS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Individuals with certain disabilities. Each case relating to  Medicare eligibility resulting from being disabled requires individual  investigation. All beneficiaries except dependents of active duty  members lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes  available to a disabled person unless the following conditions have been  met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The individual is under 65 years old;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions  of 42 U.S.C. 426(b)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare except that in  the case of a retroactive determination of entitlement to Medicare Part  A hospital insurance benefits for a person under 65 years of age there  is no requirement to enroll in Medicare Part B from the Medicare Part A  entitlement date until the issuance of such retroactive determination;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS  eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System  (DEERS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Disabled students, that is children age 21 or 22, who are  pursuing a full-   time course of higher education and who, either during the school year  or between semesters, suffer a disabling illness or injury with  resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remain  eligible for CHAMPUS medical benefits for 6 months after the disability  is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday,  whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd  birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher  education, CHAMPUS benefits can be continued until the 23rd birthday.  The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not  change the eligibility status of a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in  a full time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed  before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a  dependent child 21 or 22 years old in student status does not have  eligibility and may not qualify for eligibility under the requirements  related to mental or physical incapacity as described in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(H)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility. Circumstances which result  in reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> End Stage renal disease. Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been  continued under paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the section, when Medicare  eligibility ceases for end-stage renal disease patients, CHAMPUS  eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. He or she  is required to take action to be reinstated as a CHAMPUS beneficiary and  to obtain a new identification card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disability. Some disabilities are permanent, others temporary.  Each case must be reviewed individually. Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has  been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, when  disability ends and Medicare eligibility ceases, CHAMPUS eligibility  resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. Again, he or she is  required to take action to obtain a new CHAMPUS identification card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(vi)</em> of this section due to beneficiary action to decline Part B  of Medicare, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes, effective on the date Medicare  Part B coverage begins, if the person subsequently enrolls in Medicare  Part B and the person is otherwise still eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Determination of eligibility status. Determination of an  individual's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary is the primary  responsibility of the Uniformed Service in which the member or former  member is, or was, a member, or in the case of dependents of a NATO  military member, the Service that sponsors the NATO member. For the  purpose of program integrity, the appropriate Uniformed Service shall,  upon request of the Director, OCHAMPUS, review the eligibility of a  specific person when there is reason to question the eligibility status.  In such cases, a report on the results of the review and any action  taken will be submitted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Procedures for determination of eligibility. Procedures for the  determination of eligibility are prescribed within the Department of  Defense Instruction 1000.13 available at local military facilities  personnel offices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> CHAMPUS procedures for verification of eligibility. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Eligibility for CHAMPUS benefits will be verified through the Defense  Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) maintained by the  Uniformed Services, except for abused dependents as set forth in  paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. It is the responsibility of the  CHAMPUS beneficiary, or parent, or legal representative, when  appropriate, to provide the necessary evidence required for entry into  the DEERS file to establish CHAMPUS eligibility and to ensure that all  changes in status that may affect eligibility be reported immediately to  the appropriate Uniformed Service for action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ineligibility for CHAMPUS benefits may be presumed in the  absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall issue guidelines as necessary to  implement the provisions of this section.
