                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The final reported test results for the mass particulate  (Mp) in grams/mile shall be computed as follows.  Mp = 0.43(Mp1 + Mp2)/(Dct +  Ds) + 0.57(Mp3 + Mp2)/(Dht =  Ds)  where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> for determination.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mp2 = Mass of particulate determined from the  ``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, in grams per test phase.  (See Sec. 86.110-82(c)(1) for determination.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mp3 = Mass of particulate determined from the  ``transient'' phase of the hot start test, in grams per test phase. (See  Sec. 86.110-82(c)(1) for determination).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Dct = The measured driving distance from the  ``transient'' phase of the cold start test, in miles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ds = The measured driving distance from the  ``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, in miles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Dht = The measured driving distance from the  ``transient'' phase of the hot start test, in miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The mass of particulate for each phase of testing is determined  as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.074   where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> j = 1, 2 or 3 depending on which phase the mass of particulate  is being determined for (i.e., the ``transient'' phase of the cold start  test, the ``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, or the  ``transient'' phase of the hot start test).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vmix = Total dilute exhaust volume in cubic meters  per test, corrected to standard conditions 528R (293K) and 29.92 in Hg  (101.3 kPa). Vmix is further defined in Sec. 86.144.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pe = mass of particulate per test on the exhaust  filter(s), grams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pb = mass of particulate on the ``background''  filter, grams.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The background particulate level, Pb, inside the  dilution air filter box at   EPA is very low. Pb will be assumed = 0, and background  particulate samples will not be taken with each exhaust sample. It is  recommended that background particulate checks be made periodically to  verify the low level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any manufacturer may make the same assumption without prior EPA  approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If Pb is assumed = 0, then no background correction  is made. The equation for particulate mass emissions then reduces to: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.075</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Vep = total volume of sample pulled through the  filter, cubic feet at standard conditions. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.076   where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vap = corrected (according to procedure specified in  Sec. 85.120) dilute exhaust sample volume, cubic feet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pbar = barometric pressure, in Hg.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Pip = pressure elevation above ambient measured at  the inlet to the dilute exhaust sample gas meter or flow instrument, in  Hg. (For most gas meters with unrestricted discharge Pip is  negligible and can be assumed = 0.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tip = average temperature of the dilute exhaust  sample at the inlet to the gas meter or flow instrument, R.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Vbp = total volume of the background sample, cubic  feet at standard conditions. (Vbp is not required if  Pb is assumed = 0.) It is calculated using the following  formula: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.077   where:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vab = corrected (according to procedure specified in  Sec. 85.120) background sample volume, cubic feet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pbar = barometric pressure, in. Hg.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Pib = pressure elevation above ambient measured at  the inlet to the background gas meter or flow instrument, in Hg. (For  most gas meters with unrestricted discharge Pib is negligible  and can be assumed = 0.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tib = average temperature of the background sample  at the inlet to the gas meter or flow instrument, R.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> DF = dilution factor. (DF is not required if Pb is  assumed = 0.)  [45 FR 14523, Mar. 5, 1980, as amended at 46 FR 50494, Oct. 13, 1981,  and 47 FR 49807, Nov. 2, 1982]</p>
