                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Actually available terms. If an advertisement for credit states specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will be arranged or offered by the creditor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures. (1) Any term required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(3) set forth affirmatively or negatively in an advertisement for an open-end (not home-secured) credit plan triggers additional disclosures under this section. Any term required to be disclosed

under Sec. 226.6(a)(1) or (a)(2) set forth affirmatively or negatively in an advertisement for a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b triggers additional disclosures under this section. If any of the terms that trigger additional disclosures under this paragraph is set forth in an advertisement, the advertisement shall also clearly and conspicuously set forth the following: \36d\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\36d\ [Reserved]---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any minimum, fixed, transaction, activity or similar charge that is a finance charge under Sec. 226.4 that could be imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any periodic rate that may be applied expressed as an annual percentage rate as determined under Sec. 226.14(b). If the plan provides for a variable periodic rate, that fact shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any membership or participation fee that could be imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an advertisement for credit to finance the purchase of goods or services specified in the advertisement states a periodic payment amount, the advertisement shall also state the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation, assuming that the consumer pays only the periodic payment amount advertised. The disclosure of the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation must be equally prominent to the statement of the periodic payment amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Catalogs or other multiple-page advertisements; electronic advertisements. (1) If a catalog or other multiple-page advertisement, or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site), gives information in a table or schedule in sufficient detail to permit determination of the disclosures required by paragraph (b) of this section, it shall be considered a single advertisement if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a catalog or other multiple-page advertisement, or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site), gives information in a table or schedule in sufficient detail to permit determination of the disclosures required by paragraph (b) of this section, it shall be considered a single advertisement if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The table or schedule is clearly and conspicuously set forth; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any statement of terms set forth in Sec. 226.6 appearing anywhere else in the catalog or advertisement clearly refers to the page or location where the table or schedule begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A catalog or other multiple-page advertisement or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site) complies with this paragraph if the table or schedule of terms includes all appropriate disclosures for a representative scale of amounts up to the level of the more commonly sold higher-priced property or services offered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional requirements for home-equity plans--(1) Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures. If any of the terms required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(a)(1) or (a)(2) or the payment terms of the plan are set forth, affirmatively or negatively, in an advertisement for a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, the advertisement also shall clearly and conspicuously set forth the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures. If any of the terms required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(a)(1) or (a)(2) or the payment terms of the plan are set forth, affirmatively or negatively, in an advertisement for a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of Sec. 226.5b, the advertisement also shall clearly and conspicuously set forth the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any loan fee that is a percentage of the credit limit under the plan and an estimate of any other fees imposed for opening the plan, stated as a single dollar amount or a reasonable range.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any periodic rate used to compute the finance charge, expressed as an annual percentage rate as determined under Sec. 226.14(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The maximum annual percentage rate that may be imposed in a variable-rate plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discounted and premium rates. If an advertisement states an initial annual percentage rate that is not based on the index and margin used to make later rate adjustments in a variable-rate plan, the advertisement also shall state with equal prominence and in close proximity to the initial rate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The period of time such initial rate will be in effect; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A reasonably current annual percentage rate that would have been in effect using the index and margin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Balloon payment. If an advertisement contains a statement of any minimum periodic payment and a balloon payment may result if only the minimum periodic payments are made, even if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely, the advertisement also shall state with equal prominence and in close proximity to the minimum periodic payment statement that a balloon payment may result, if applicable.\36e\ A balloon payment results if paying the minimum periodic payments does not

fully amortize the outstanding balance by a specified date or time, and the consumer is required to repay the entire outstanding balance at such time. If a balloon payment will occur when the consumer makes only the minimum payments required under the plan, an advertisement for such a program which contains any statement of any minimum periodic payment shall also state with equal prominence and in close proximity to the minimum periodic payment statement:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\36e\ [Reserved]---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That a balloon payment will result; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount and timing of the balloon payment that will result if the consumer makes only the minimum payments for the maximum period of time that the consumer is permitted to make such payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tax implications. An advertisement that states that any interest expense incurred under the home-equity plan is or may be tax deductible may not be misleading in this regard. If an advertisement distributed in paper form or through the Internet (rather than by radio or television) is for a home-equity plan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, and the advertisement states that the advertised extension of credit may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling, the advertisement shall clearly and conspicuously state that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The interest on the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the fair market value of the dwelling is not tax deductible for Federal income tax purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The consumer should consult a tax adviser for further information regarding the deductibility of interest and charges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Misleading terms. An advertisement may not refer to a home-equity plan as ``free money'' or contain a similarly misleading term.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Promotional rates and payments. (i) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraph (d)(6) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraph (d)(6) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Promotional rate. The term ``promotional rate'' means, in a variable-rate plan, any annual percentage rate that is not based on the index and margin that will be used to make rate adjustments under the plan, if that rate is less than a reasonably current annual percentage rate that would be in effect under the index and margin that will be used to make rate adjustments under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Promotional payment. The term ``promotional payment'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a variable-rate plan, any minimum payment applicable for a promotional period that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is not derived by applying the index and margin to the outstanding balance when such index and margin will be used to determine other minimum payments under the plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is less than other minimum payments under the plan derived by applying a reasonably current index and margin that will be used to determine the amount of such payments, given an assumed balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a plan other than a variable-rate plan, any minimum payment applicable for a promotional period if that payment is less than other payments required under the plan given an assumed balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Promotional period. A ``promotional period'' means a period of time, less than the full term of the loan, that the promotional rate or promotional payment may be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stating the promotional period and post-promotional rate or payments. If any annual percentage rate that may be applied to a plan is a promotional rate, or if any payment applicable to a plan is a promotional payment, the following must be disclosed in any advertisement, other than television or radio advertisements, in a clear and conspicuous manner with equal prominence and in close proximity to each listing of the promotional rate or payment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The period of time during which the promotional rate or promotional payment will apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a promotional rate, any annual percentage rate that will apply under the plan. If such rate is variable, the annual percentage rate must be disclosed in accordance with the accuracy standards in Secs. 226.5b or 226.16(b)(1)(ii) as applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a promotional payment, the amounts and time periods of any payments that will apply under the plan. In variable-rate transactions,

payments that will be determined based on application of an index and margin shall be disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Envelope excluded. The requirements in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section do not apply to an envelope in which an application or solicitation is mailed, or to a banner advertisement or pop-up advertisement linked to an application or solicitation provided electronically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Alternative disclosures--television or radio advertisements. An advertisement made through television or radio stating any of the terms requiring additional disclosures under paragraphs (b)(1) or (d)(1) of this section may alternatively comply with paragraphs (b)(1) or (d)(1) of this section by stating the information required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section, as applicable, and listing a toll-free telephone number, or any telephone number that allows a consumer to reverse the phone charges when calling for information, along with a reference that such number may be used by consumers to obtain the additional cost information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Misleading terms. An advertisement may not refer to an annual percentage rate as ``fixed,'' or use a similar term, unless the advertisement also specifies a time period that the rate will be fixed and the rate will not increase during that period, or if no such time period is provided, the rate will not increase while the plan is open.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Promotional rates and fees. (1) Scope. The requirements of this paragraph apply to any advertisement of an open-end (not home-secured) plan, including promotional materials accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(c) or accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. The requirements of this paragraph apply to any advertisement of an open-end (not home-secured) plan, including promotional materials accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(c) or accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. (i) Promotional rate means any annual percentage rate applicable to one or more balances or transactions on an open-end (not home-secured) plan for a specified period of time that is lower than the annual percentage rate that will be in effect at the end of that period on such balances or transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Promotional rate means any annual percentage rate applicable to one or more balances or transactions on an open-end (not home-secured) plan for a specified period of time that is lower than the annual percentage rate that will be in effect at the end of that period on such balances or transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Introductory rate means a promotional rate offered in connection with the opening of an account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Promotional period means the maximum time period for which a promotional rate or promotional fee may be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Promotional fee means a fee required to be disclosed under Sec. 226.6(b)(1) and (2) applicable to an open-end (not home-secured) plan, or to one or more balances or transactions on an open-end (not home-secured) plan, for a specified period of time that is lower than the fee that will be in effect at the end of that period for such plan or types of balances or transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Introductory fee means a promotional fee offered in connection with the opening of an account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stating the term ``introductory''. If any annual percentage rate or fee that may be applied to the account is an introductory rate or introductory fee, the term introductory or intro must be in immediate proximity to each listing of the introductory rate or introductory fee in a written or electronic advertisement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stating the promotional period and post-promotional rate or fee. If any annual percentage rate that may be applied to the account is a promotional rate under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section or any fee that may be applied to the account is a promotional fee under paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section, the information in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be stated in a clear and conspicuous manner in the advertisement. If the rate or fee is stated in a written or electronic advertisement, the information in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and, as applicable, (g)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must also be stated in a prominent location closely proximate to the first listing of the promotional rate or promotional fee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the promotional rate or promotional fee will end;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The annual percentage rate that will apply after the end of the promotional period. If such rate is variable, the annual percentage rate must comply with the accuracy standards in Secs. 226.5a(c)(2), 226.5a(d)(3), 226.5a(e)(4), or 226.16(b)(1)(ii), as applicable. If such

rate cannot be determined at the time disclosures are given because the rate depends at least in part on a later determination of the consumer's creditworthiness, the advertisement must disclose the specific rates or the range of rates that might apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The fee that will apply after the end of the promotional period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Envelope excluded. The requirements in paragraph (g)(4) of this section do not apply to an envelope or other enclosure in which an application or solicitation is mailed, or to a banner advertisement or pop-up advertisement, linked to an application or solicitation provided electronically.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Deferred interest or similar offers. (1) Scope. The requirements of this paragraph apply to any advertisement of an open-end credit plan not subject to Sec. 226.5b, including promotional materials accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(c) or accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. The requirements of this paragraph apply to any advertisement of an open-end credit plan not subject to Sec. 226.5b, including promotional materials accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(c) or accompanying applications or solicitations subject to Sec. 226.5a(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. ``Deferred interest'' means finance charges, accrued on balances or transactions, that a consumer is not obligated to pay or that will be waived or refunded to a consumer if those balances or transactions are paid in full by a specified date. The maximum period from the date the consumer becomes obligated for the balance or transaction until the specified date by which the consumer must pay the balance or transaction in full in order to avoid finance charges, or receive a waiver or refund of finance charges, is the ``deferred interest period.'' ``Deferred interest'' does not include any finance charges the consumer avoids paying in connection with any recurring grace period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Stating the deferred interest period. If a deferred interest offer is advertised, the deferred interest period must be stated in a clear and conspicuous manner in the advertisement. If the phrase ``no interest'' or similar term regarding the possible avoidance of interest obligations under the deferred interest program is stated, the term ``if paid in full'' must also be stated in a clear and conspicuous manner preceding the disclosure of the deferred interest period in the advertisement. If the deferred interest offer is included in a written or electronic advertisement, the deferred interest period and, if applicable, the term ``if paid in full'' must also be stated in immediate proximity to each statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Stating the terms of the deferred interest or similar offer. If any deferred interest offer is advertised, the information in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (h)(4)(ii) of this section must be stated in the advertisement, in language similar to Sample G-24 in Appendix G to this part. If the deferred interest offer is included in a written or electronic advertisement, the information in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (h)(4)(ii) of this section must also be stated in a prominent location closely proximate to the first statement of ``no interest,'' ``no payments,'' ``deferred interest,'' ``same as cash,'' or similar term regarding interest or payments during the deferred interest period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement that interest will be charged from the date the consumer becomes obligated for the balance or transaction subject to the deferred interest offer if the balance or transaction is not paid in full within the deferred interest period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A statement, if applicable, that interest will be charged from the date the consumer incurs the balance or transaction subject to the deferred interest offer if the account is in default before the end of the deferred interest period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Envelope excluded. The requirements in paragraph (h)(4) of this section do not apply to an envelope or other enclosure in which an application or solicitation is mailed, or to a banner advertisement or pop-up advertisement linked to an application or solicitation provided electronically.
