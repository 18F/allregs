Sec. 298.53 and/or 204.7 of this chapter, it may continue to conduct air taxi operations provided that the carrier maintains in effect liability insurance coverage as required for such operations by part 205 of this chapter and, within 10 days of the cessation of scheduled passenger operations, registers as an air taxi operator in accordance with subpart C of this part; and provided further that the carrier continues to hold authority from the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct such air taxi operations.</p>
