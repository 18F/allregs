The affidavit shall list the American underwriters to which the risk was offered, and such underwriters shall account for at least 50 percent of the approved American market capacity, or 75 percent in the event that more than 75 percent of the risk was placed in foreign markets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to comply with (a) or (b), above, may result in MARAD requiring that the risk be reoffered and that the existing placement be modified, as deemed appropriate.</p>
