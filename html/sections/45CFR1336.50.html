Recipients of financial  assistance under sections 803, 804, and 805 of the Act are required to  provide a matching share of 20 percent of the approved cost of the  assisted project.  This requirement may be waived in accordance with the criteria in Sec.  1336.50(b)(3). The matching share requirement may be met using either  cash or in-kind contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application. If an applicant wishes to request a waiver of the  requirement for a 20 percent non-Federal matching share, it must include  with is application for funding a written justification that clearly  explains why the applicant cannot provide the matching share and how it  meets the criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Criteria. Both of the following criterial must be met for an  applicant to be eligible for a waiver of the non-Federal matching  requirement:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applicant lacks the available resources to meet part or all of  the non-Federal matching requirement. This must be documented by an  institutional audit if available, or a full disclosure of applicant's  total assets and liabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applicant can document that reasonable efforts to obtain cash  or inkind contributions for the purposes of the project from third  parties have been unsuccessful. Evidence of such efforts can include  letters from possible sources of funding indicating that the requested  resources are not available for that project. The requests must be  appropriate to the source in terms of project purpose, applicant  eligibility, and reasonableness of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Approval. For a waiver to be approved, ANA must determine that  it will not prevent the award of other grants at levels it believes are  desirable for the purposes of the program. Waiver of all or part of the  non-Federal share shall apply only to the budget period for which  application was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintenance of effort. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications for financial assistance  under this Part must include either a statement of compliance with the  maintenance of effort requirement contained in section 803(c) of the  Act, or a request for a waiver, in accordance with criteria established  in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To be eligible for a waiver of the maintenance of effort  requirement, the applicant must demonstrate to ANA that the organization  whose funds previously supported the project discontinued its support:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As a result of funding limitations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not as a result of an adverse evaluation of the project's  purpose or the manner in which it was conducted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not because it was anticipated that Federal funds would  replace the original source of project funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition, the applicant must demonstrate in the request for a  waiver that the maintenance of effort requirement would result in  insurmountable hardship for the recipient or would otherwise be  inconsistent with the purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delegation of project operations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each subgrant awarded to a  delegate agency must have specific prior approval by ANA. Such  delegation must be formalized by written agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agreement must specify the activities to be performed by the  delegate agency, the time schedule, the policies and procedures to be  followed, the dollar limitations, and the costs allowed. The applicant  must submit a budget for each delegate agency as part of its  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unallowable costs. ANA funds may not be used by recipients to  purchase real property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Office of the Chief Executive. The costs of salaries and  expenses of the Office of Chief Executive of a federally recognized  Indian tribal government (as defined in Sec. 74.3 of this title) are  allowable, provided that such costs exclude any portion of salaries and  expenses of the Office of Chief Executive that are a cost of general  government and provided they are related to a project assisted under  this part.</p>
