Required maintenance activity shall be specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Names and addresses of at least one qualified service agency to perform the required periodic maintenance shall be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> HVAC controls systems maintenance and calibration information, including wiring diagrams, schematics, and control sequence descriptions. Desired or field determined setpoints shall be permanently recorded on control drawings, at control devices, or, for digital control systems, in programming comments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A complete narrative, prepared by the designer, of how each system is intended to operate shall be included with the construction documents.</p><p class="depth0">403.2.10.2 Drawings. Construction documents shall require that within 30 days after the date of system acceptance, record drawings of the actual installation be provided to the Federal agency. The drawings shall include details of the air barrier installation in every envelope component, demonstrating continuity of the air barrier at all joints and penetrations.</p><p class="depth0">403.2.10.3 Air System Balancing. Construction documents shall require that all HVAC systems be balanced in accordance with the industry accepted procedures (such as National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB) Procedural Standards, Associated Air Balance Council (AABC) National Standards, or ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 111). Air and water flow rates shall be measured and adjusted to deliver final flow rates within 10% of design rates, except variable flow distribution systems need not be balanced upstream of the controlling device (VAV box or control valve).</p><p class="depth0">403.2.10.3.1 Construction documents shall require a written balance report be provided to the Federal agency for HVAC systems serving zones with a total conditioned area exceeding 5,000 ft\2\.</p><p class="depth0">403.2.10.3.2 Air systems shall be balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses, then fan speed shall be adjusted to meet design flow conditions or equivalent procedures. Exceptions are as follows: Damper throttling may be used for air system balancing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> With fan motors of 1 hp (0.746 kW) or less, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Of throttling results in no greater than \1/3\ hp (0.248 kW) fan horsepower draw above that required if the fan speed were adjusted.</p><p class="depth0">403.2.10.4 Hydronic System Balancing. Hydronic systems shall be balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses; then the pump impeller shall be trimmed or pump speed shall be adjusted to meet design flow conditions. Exceptions are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Pumps with pump motors of 10 hp (7.46 kW) or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If throttling results in no greater than 3 hp (2.23 kW) pump horsepower draw above that required if the impeller were trimmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> To reserve additional pump pressure capability in open circuit piping systems subject to fouling. Valve throttling pressure drop shall not exceed that expected for future fouling.</p><p class="depth0">403.2.10.5 Control System Testing. HVAC control systems shall be tested to assure that control elements are calibrated, adjusted, and in proper working condition. For projects larger than 50,000 ft2 conditioned area, detailed instructions for commissioning HVAC systems shall be provided by the designer in plans and specifications.</p>
