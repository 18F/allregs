                            <p class="depth0">On or before the expiration date of any right-of-way heretofore or hereafter granted for a limited term of years, an application may be submitted for a renewal of the grant. If the renewal involves no change in the location or status of the original right-of-way grant, the applicant may file with his application a certificate under oath setting out this fact, and the Secretary, with the consent required by Sec. 169.3, may thereupon extend the grant for a like term of years, upon the payment of consideration as set forth in Sec. 169.12. If any change in the size, type, or location of the right-of-way is involved, the application for renewal shall be treated and handled as in the case of an original application for a right-of-way.</p>
