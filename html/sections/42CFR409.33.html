                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Services that could qualify as either skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation services--(1) Overall management and evaluation of care plan. (i) When overall management and evaluation of care plan constitute skilled services. The development, management, and evaluation of a patient care plan based on the physician's orders constitute skilled services when, because of the patient's physical or mental condition, those activities require the involvement of technical or professional personnel in order to meet the patient's needs, promote recovery, and ensure medical safety. Those activities include the management of a plan involving a variety of personal care services only when, in light of the patient's condition, the aggregate of those services requires the involvement of technical or professional personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Overall management and evaluation of care plan.

The development, management, and evaluation of a patient care plan based on the physician's orders constitute skilled services when, because of the patient's physical or mental condition, those activities require the involvement of technical or professional personnel in order to meet the patient's needs, promote recovery, and ensure medical safety. Those activities include the management of a plan involving a variety of personal care services only when, in light of the patient's condition, the aggregate of those services requires the involvement of technical or professional personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. An aged patient with a history of diabetes mellitus and angina pectoris who is recovering from an open reduction of a fracture of the neck of the femur requires, among other services, careful skin care, appropriate oral medications, a diabetic diet, an exercise program to preserve muscle tone and body condition, and observation to detect signs of deterioration in his or her condition or complications resulting from restricted, but increasing, mobility. Although any of the required services could be performed by a properly instructed person, such a person would not have the ability to understand the relationship between the services and evaluate the ultimate effect of one service on the other. Since the nature of the patient's condition, age, and immobility create a high potential for serious complications, such an understanding is essential to ensure the patient's recovery and safety. Under these circumstances, the management of the plan of care would require the skills of a nurse even though the individual services are not skilled. Skilled planning and management activities are not always specifically identified in the patient's clinical record. Therefore, if the patient's overall condition supports a finding that recovery and safety can be ensured only if the total care is planned, managed, and evaluated by technical or professional personnel, it is appropriate to infer that skilled services are being provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Observation and assessment of the patient's changing condition--(i) When observation and assessment constitute skilled services. Observation and assessment constitute skilled services when the skills of a technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for modification of treatment or for additional medical procedures until his or her condition is stabilized.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When observation and assessment constitute skilled services. Observation and assessment constitute skilled services when the skills of a technical or professional person are required to identify and evaluate the patient's need for modification of treatment or for additional medical procedures until his or her condition is stabilized.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. A patient with congestive heart failure may require continuous close observation to detect signs of decompensation, abnormal fluid balance, or adverse effects resulting from prescribed medication(s) that serve as indicators for adjusting therapeutic

measures. Similarly, surgical patients transferred from a hospital to an SNF while in the complicated, unstabilized postoperative period, for example, after hip prosthesis or cataract surgery, may need continued close skilled monitoring for postoperative complications and adverse reaction. Patients who, in addition to their physical problems, exhibit acute psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or agitation, may also require skilled observation and assessment by technical or professional personnel to ensure their safety or the safety of others, that is, to observe for indications of suicidal or hostile behavior. The need for services of this type must be documented by physicians' orders or nursing or therapy notes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Patient education services--(i) When patient education services constitute skilled services. Patient education services are skilled services if the use of technical or professional personnel is necessary to teach a patient self-maintenance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When patient education services constitute skilled services. Patient education services are skilled services if the use of technical or professional personnel is necessary to teach a patient self-maintenance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. A patient who has had a recent leg amputation needs skilled rehabilitation services provided by technical or professional personnel to provide gait training and to teach prosthesis care. Similarly, a patient newly diagnosed with diabetes requires instruction from technical or professional personnel to learn the self-administration of insulin or foot-care precautions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Services that qualify as skilled nursing services. (1) Intravenous or intramuscular injections and intravenous feeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Intravenous or intramuscular injections and intravenous feeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enteral feeding that comprises at least 26 per cent of daily calorie requirements and provides at least 501 milliliters of fluid per day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nasopharyngeal and tracheostomy aspiration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Insertion and sterile irrigation and replacement of suprapubic catheters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Application of dressings involving prescription medications and aseptic techniques;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Treatment of extensive decubitus ulcers or other widespread skin disorder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Heat treatments which have been specifically ordered by a physician as part of active treatment and which require observation by nurses to adequately evaluate the patient's progress;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Initial phases of a regimen involving administration of medical gases;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Rehabilitation nursing procedures, including the related teaching and adaptive aspects of nursing, that are part of active treatment, e.g., the institution and supervision of bowel and bladder training programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Services which would qualify as skilled rehabilitation services. (1) Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation needs and potential: Services concurrent with the management of a patient care plan, including tests and measurements of range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, functional ability, activities of daily living, perceptual deficits, speech and language or hearing disorders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ongoing assessment of rehabilitation needs and potential: Services concurrent with the management of a patient care plan, including tests and measurements of range of motion, strength, balance, coordination, endurance, functional ability, activities of daily living, perceptual deficits, speech and language or hearing disorders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Therapeutic exercises or activities: Therapeutic exercises or activities which, because of the type of exercises employed or the condition of the patient, must be performed by or under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist or occupational therapist to ensure the safety of the patient and the effectiveness of the treatment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gait evaluation and training: Gait evaluation and training furnished to restore function in a patient whose ability to walk has been impaired by neurological, muscular, or skeletal abnormality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Range of motion exercises: Range of motion exercises which are part of the active treatment of a specific disease state which has resulted in a loss of, or restriction of, mobility (as evidenced by a therapist's notes showing the degree of motion lost and the degree to be restored);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Maintenance therapy; Maintenance therapy, when the specialized knowledge and judgment of a qualified therapist is required to design and establish a maintenance program based on an initial evaluation and periodic reassessment of the patient's needs, and consistent with the patient's capacity and tolerance. For example, a patient with Parkinson's disease who has not been under a rehabilitation regimen may require the services of a qualified therapist to determine what

type of exercises will contribute the most to the maintenance of his present level of functioning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ultrasound, short-wave, and microwave therapy treatment by a qualified physical therapist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Hot pack, hydrocollator, infrared treatments, paraffin baths, and whirlpool; Hot pack hydrocollator, infrared treatments, paraffin baths, and whirlpool in particular cases where the patient's condition is complicated by circulatory deficiency, areas of desensitization, open wounds, fractures, or other complications, and the skills, knowledge, and judgment of a qualified physical therapist are required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Services of a speech pathologist or audiologist when necessary for the restoration of function in speech or hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Personal care services. Personal care services which do not require the skills of qualified technical or professional personnel are not skilled services except under the circumstances specified in Sec. 409.32(b). Personal care services include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Administration of routine oral medications, eye drops, and ointments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General maintenance care of colostomy and ileostomy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Routine services to maintain satisfactory functioning of indwelling bladder catheters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Changes of dressings for noninfected postoperative or chronic conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prophylactic and palliative skin care, including bathing and application of creams, or treatment of minor skin problems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Routine care of the incontinent patient, including use of diapers and protective sheets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> General maintenance care in connection with a plaster cast;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Routine care in connection with braces and similar devices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Use of heat as a palliative and comfort measure, such as whirlpool and hydrocollator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Routine administration of medical gases after a regimen of therapy has been established;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Assistance in dressing, eating, and going to the toilet;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Periodic turning and positioning in bed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> General supervision of exercises which have been taught to the patient; including the actual carrying out of maintenance programs, i.e., the performance of the repetitive exercises required to maintain function do not require the skills of a therapist and would not constitute skilled rehabilitation services (see paragraph (c) of this section). Similarly, repetitious exercises to improve gait, maintain strength, or endurance; passive exercises to maintain range of motion in paralyzed extremities, which are not related to a specific loss of function; and assistive walking do not constitute skilled rehabilitation services.
