                                Sec. 23.45  What are the requirements for submitting overall goal
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must submit your overall goals to the appropriate FAA  Regional Civil Rights Office for approval. Your first set of overall  goals meeting the requirements of this subpart are due on the following  schedule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are a large or medium hub primary airport on April 21,  2005, by January 1, 2006. You must make your next submissions by October  1, 2008.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a small hub primary airport on April 21, 2005, by  October 1, 2006.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you are a nonhub primary airport on April 21, 2005, by  October 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must then submit new goals every three years after the date  that applies to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Timely submission and FAA approval of your overall goals is a  condition of eligibility for FAA financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the time before you make your first submission under  paragraph (a) of this section, you must continue to use the overall  goals that have been approved by the FAA before the effective date of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Your overall goal submission must include a description of the  method used to calculate your goals and the data you relied on. You must  ``show your work'' to enable the FAA to understand how you concluded  your goals were appropriate. This means that you must provide to the FAA  the data, calculations, assumptions, and reasoning used in establishing  your goals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Your submission must include your projection of the portions of  your overall goals you propose to meet through use of race-neutral and  race-conscious means, respectively, and the basis for making this  projection (see Sec. 23.51(d)(5))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> FAA may approve or disapprove the way you calculated your goal,  including your race-neutral/race-conscious ``split,'' as part of its  review of your plan or goal submission. Except as provided in paragraph  (h) of this section, the FAA does not approve or disapprove the goal  itself (i.e., the number).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the FAA determines that your goals have not been correctly  calculated or the justification is inadequate, the FAA may, after  consulting with you, adjust your overall goal or race-conscious/race- neutral ``split.'' The adjusted goal represents the FAA's determination  of an appropriate overall goal for ACDBE participation in the  recipient's concession program, based on relevant data and analysis. The  adjusted goal is binding on you.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a new concession opportunity, the estimated average annual  gross revenues of which are anticipated to be $200,000 or greater,  arises at a time that falls between normal submission dates for overall  goals, you must submit an appropriate adjustment to your overall goal to  the FAA for approval no later than 90 days before issuing the  solicitation for the new concession opportunity.
