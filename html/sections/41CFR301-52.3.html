                            <p class="depth0">As soon as your agency fully deploys the E-Gov Travel Service (ETS),  you must use the ETS to file all your travel claims. (Agencies are  required to fully deploy the ETS no later than September 30, 2006.)  Until that time, you must file your travel claim in the format  prescribed by your agency. If the prescribed travel claim is hardcopy,  the claim must be signed in ink. Any alterations or erasures to your  hardcopy travel claim must be initialed. If your agency has electronic  processing, use your electronic signature where required.
