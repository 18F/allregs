The approved OMB control number is   identified in 30 CFR 1210.10. We will use the information collected to  review and approve delegation proposals from States wishing to perform  royalty management functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Federal Government will reimburse some costs, as provided by  statute, for delegated functions that each state performs. However,  states could incur additional start-up costs, such as purchasing  equipment necessary to perform a delegated function that may not be  reimbursable. The ONRR estimates that each payor or reporter will  coordinate their interactions and communications among the several  states and with ONRR.
