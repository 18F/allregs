In this case, the owner or operator shall  repair the defect at the next time the process or unit that is  generating the regulated-material managed in the surface impoundment  stops operation. Repair of the defect shall be completed before the  process or unit resumes operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect  repair in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.  63.947 of  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must prepare and maintain at the plant  site written documentation identifying the specific air pollution  control equipment designated as ``unsafe to inspect and monitor.''
