                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Cargo ports and other similar openings in the sides of vessels below the freeboard deck shall be fitted with doors so designed as to ensure watertightness and structural integrity commensurate with the surrounding shell plating, to the satisfaction of the assigning authority. The arrangements shall be subject to tightness tests at the initial survey and at such subsequent surveys or more frequent intervals as deemed necessary. The number of such openings shall be the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless permitted by the Commandant the lower edge of such openings shall not be below a line drawn parallel to the freeboard deck at side, which has at its lowest point the upper edge of the uppermost load line.
