                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Whenever a Certificate of Naturalization has been  delivered which does not conform to the facts shown on the application  for naturalization, or a clerical error was made in preparing the  certificate, an application for issuance of a corrected certificate may  be filed, without fee, in accordance with the form instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Court-issued certificates. If the certificate was originally  issued by a clerk of court under a prior statute and USCIS finds that a  correction is justified and can be made without mutilating the  certificate, USCIS will authorize the issuing court to make the  necessary correction and to place a dated endorsement of the court on  the reverse of the certificate explaining the correction. The  authorization will be filed with the naturalization record of the court,  the corrected certificate will be returned to the naturalized person,  and the duplicate will be endorsed to show the date and nature of the  correction and endorsement made, and then returned to USCIS. No fee will  be charged the naturalized person for the correction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> USCIS-issued certificates. If the certificate was originally  issued by USCIS (or its predecessor agency), and USCIS finds that a  correction was justified, the correction shall be made to the  certificate and a dated endorsement made on the reverse of the  certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative actions. When a correction made pursuant to  paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section would or does result in mutilation  of a certificate, USCIS will issue a replacement Certificate of  Naturalization and destroy the surrendered certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data change. The correction will not be deemed to be justified  where the naturalized person later alleges that the name or date of  birth which the applicant stated to be his or her correct name or date  of birth at the time of naturalization was not in fact his or her name  or date of birth at the time of the naturalization.
