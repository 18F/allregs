                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OPDIVs shall foster, to the extent practicable, maximum participation by small businesses in HHS acquisitions. Prior to issuing a solicitation, the Contracting Officer shall make every reasonable effort to find small business concerns that can compete for the proposed requirement--see FAR 19.202, 10.001(2)(v), and 10.002(b)(1)(vii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it cannot be determined in advance (through market research under FAR Part 10, discussions between the Contracting Officer and the SBS, or other means--see FAR 15.201, whether a solicitation in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold can be set aside exclusively for small business participation [whether for small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; or 8(a) small business(es)], the Contracting Officer may publish a notice entitled ``Small Business Sources Sought'' in FedBizOpps. The purpose of a Small Business Sources Sought notice is to identify the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; and their size classification relative to the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICs) code. This will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. However, to solicit technical, scientific, or business information for project planning purposes, an RFI may be used--see 315.201(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When using a Small Business Sought notice, an OPDIV shall not request that potential sources provide more than the minimum information necessary--see FAR 10.001(b), to determine whether they have the apparent capability to perform a requirement and, therefore, whether they should be included in any future competition. The notice and the information received shall not be used to determine how well respondents can perform a requirement, which can only be evaluated in response to a solicitation. Accordingly, the notice shall not be used to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain capability statements that are evaluated and determined acceptable or unacceptable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Require cost/price proposals or detailed technical solutions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Identify a prospective sole source; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Exclude small business concerns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OPDIVs shall follow the standard HHS instructions for completing a ``Small Business Sources Sought'' notice.'' The template for the notice is available on the ASFR/OGAPA/DA Internet Web site. The Contracting Officer shall post the notice in FedBizOpps by selecting and completing a Sources Sought notice, accessible on the FedBizOpps ``Notices'' page at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Additional information may be included in the notice in accordance with OPDIV procedures. The Contracting Officer shall document, in the form of a memorandum to the file, the results of the review by technical personnel of information submitted in response to the notice, including whether each respondent appears to be capable of performing the requirement. The Contracting Officer shall attach a copy of the analysis provided by the technical personnel to the memorandum.</p>
