The training requirements for various categories of persons are defined by job function or responsibility. An ``X'' in a box under a category of persons indicates that the specified category must receive the noted training. All training requirements apply to direct supervisors as well as to persons actually performing the job function. Training requirements for certificate holders authorized in their operations specifications to transport hazardous materials (will-carry) are prescribed in Table 1. Those certificate holders with a prohibition in their operations specifications against carrying or handling hazardous materials (will-not-carry) must follow the curriculum prescribed in Table 2. The method of delivering the training will be determined by the certificate holder. The certificate holder is responsible for providing a method (may include email, telecommunication, etc.) to answer all questions prior to testing regardless of the method of instruction. The certificate holder must certify that a test has been completed satisfactorily to verify understanding of the regulations and requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Operators That Transport Hazardous Material--Will-Carry Certificate Holders--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Operators and</p><p class="depth0">Operators and   ground-handling</p><p class="depth0">ground-handling    agents staff</p><p class="depth0">agent's staff   responsible for                     Flight crew      Crew membersAspects of transport of hazardous materials by air   Shippers (See      accepting      the handling,      Passenger-      members and      (other than</p><p class="depth0">with which they must be familiar, as a minimum     Note 2) Will-      hazardous       storage, and    handling staff   load planners     flight crew</p><p class="depth0">(See note 1)                          carry        materials (See     loading of       Will-carry       Will-carry     members) Will-</p><p class="depth0">Note 3) Will-      cargo and                                            carry</p><p class="depth0">carry        baggage Will-</p><p class="depth0">carry--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------General philosophy................................
