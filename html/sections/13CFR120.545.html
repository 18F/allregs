                                Sec. 120.545  What are SBA's policies concerning the liquidation
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">assistance loans, physical disaster business loans and economic injury</p><p class="depth0">disaster loans?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Liquidation policy. SBA or the Lender may liquidate collateral  securing a loan if the loan is in default or   there is no reasonable prospect that the loan can be repaid within a  reasonable period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sale and conversion of loans. Without the consent of the  Borrower, SBA may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sell a direct loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Convert a guaranteed or immediate participation loan to a direct  loan; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Convert an immediate participation loan to a guaranteed loan or  a loan owned solely by the Lender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sell direct and purchased 7(a) and 501, 502, 503 and 504 loans  and physical disaster home loans, physical disaster business loans and  economic injury disaster loans in asset sales. SBA will offer these  loans for sale to qualified bidders by means of competitive procedures  at publicly advertised sales. Bidder qualifications will be set for each  sale in accordance with the terms and conditions of each sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposal of collateral and assets acquired through foreclosure  or conveyance. SBA or the Lender may sell real and personal property  (including contracts and claims) pledged to secure a loan that is in  default in accordance with the provisions of the related security  instrument (see Sec. 120.550 for Homestead Protection for Farmers).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Competitive bids or negotiated sales. Generally, SBA will offer  loan collateral and acquired assets for public sale through competitive  bids at auctions or sealed bid sales. The Lender may use negotiated  sales if consistent with its usual practice for similar non-SBA assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lease of acquired property. Normally, neither SBA nor a Lender  will rent or lease acquired property or grant options to purchase. SBA  and the Lender will consider proposals for a lease if it appears a  property cannot be sold advantageously and the lease may be terminated  on reasonable notice upon receipt of a favorable purchase offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recoveries and security interests shared. SBA and the Lender  will share pro rata (in accordance with their respective interests in a  loan) all loan payments or recoveries, including proceeds from asset  sales, all reasonable expenses (including advances for the care,  preservation, and maintenance of collateral securing the loan and the  payment of senior lienholders), and any security interest or guarantee  (excluding SBA's guarantee) which the Lender or SBA may hold or receive  in connection with a loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Guarantors. Guarantors of financial assistance have no rights of  contribution against SBA on an SBA guaranteed or direct loan. SBA is not  deemed to be a co-guarantor with any other guarantors.
