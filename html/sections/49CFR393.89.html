                            <p class="depth0">Any driveshaft extending lengthways under the floor of the passenger  compartment of a bus shall be protected by means of at least one guard  or bracket at that end of the shaft which is provided with a sliding  connection (spline or other such device) to prevent the whipping of the  shaft in the event of failure thereof or of any of its component parts.  A shaft contained within a torque tube shall not require any such  device.  [33 FR 19735, Dec. 25, 1968, as amended at 53 FR 49402, Dec. 7, 1988]</p>
