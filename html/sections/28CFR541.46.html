                            <p class="depth0">The Warden shall provide the following services to a control unit inmate. These services must be provided unless compelling security or safety

reasons dictate otherwise. These reasons will be documented and signed by the Warden, indicating the Warden's review and approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Education. The Warden shall assign a member of the education staff to the control unit on at least a part-time basis to assist in developing an educational program to fulfil each inmate's academic needs. The education staff member is ordinarily a member of the control unit team.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Work assignments. Staff may assign inmates to a work assignment, such as range orderly. The manner in which these duties are carried out will reflect the inmate's unit adjustment, and will assist staff in evaluating the inmate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Industries (UNICOR). If an industry program exists in a control unit each inmate participating in this program may earn industrial pay, subject to the regulations of Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (UNICOR). The industry program is supervised by an industry foreman. The control unit team will determine when or if an industry assignment is appropriate for each inmate who submits a request for possible assignment to industries work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Legal. An inmate assigned to a control unit may use that unit's inmate basic law library, upon request and in rotation. Consistent with security considerations, the law library is to include basic legal reference books, and ordinarily a table and chair, typewriter, paper and carbon. Abuse of materials in the inmate law library (for example, a typewriter) may result in a decision by the Warden to limit the use of legal materials. A decision to limit materials due to abuse must be documented in writing and signed by the Warden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recreation. The recreation program in a control unit shall include the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each inmate shall have the opportunity to receive a minimum of seven hours weekly recreation and exercise out of the cell.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Staff shall provide various games and exercise materials as consistent with security considerations and orderly operation of the unit. Inmates who alter or intentionally damage recreation equipment may be deprived of the use of that equipment in the future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Case management services. The case manager is responsible for all areas of case management. This ordinarily includes preparation of the visiting list, notarizing documents, preparation of various reports, and other case management duties. The case manager is ordinarily a member of the control unit team.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Counselor services. The unit counselor ordinarily handles phone call requests, special concerns and requests of inmates, and requests for administrative remedy forms. The unit counselor is also available for consultation and for counseling as recommended in the mental health evaluation (see paragraph (i) of this section--Mental Health Services).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Medical services. A member of the medical staff shall visit control unit inmates daily. A physician will visit the unit as the need arises.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Mental health services. During the first 30-day period in a control unit, staff shall schedule the control unit inmate for a psychological evaluation conducted by a psychologist. Additional individual evaluations shall occur every 30 days. The psychologist shall perform and/or supervise needed psychological services. Psychiatric services will be provided when necessary. Inmates requiring prescribed psychotropic medication are not ordinarily housed in a control unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Religion. Staff shall issue religious materials upon request, limited by security consideration and housekeeping rules in the unit. This material may come from an inmate's personal property or from the chaplain's office. The institutional chaplains shall make at least weekly visits to the control unit. While individual prayer and/or worship is allowed in a control unit, religious assemblies or group meetings are not allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Food service and personal hygiene. Staff shall provide food services and personal hygiene care consistent with the requirements of the current rule regarding Special Housing Units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Correspondence. Inmates confined in a control unit are provided correspondence privileges in accordance

with the Bureau of Prisons' rule on Inmate Correspondence (see 28 CFR part 540).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Visiting. Visits for inmates confined in a control unit are conducted in a controlled visiting area, separated from regular visiting facilities. Staff shall allot a minimum of four hours per month visiting time to a control unit inmate. The number of consecutive hours visiting on a particular day may be limited by the number of visitors waiting to visit. All visitors must be on the inmate's approved visiting list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Commissary. Staff shall establish a commissary purchase schedule. The amount of money which control unit inmates spend per month is comparable to the spending limitation for inmates residing in the general population. Staff may limit commissary items to ensure the safety and security of the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Personal property. Personal property retained by an inmate in a control unit is to be stored in the space provided. Personal property items shall be limited in number and type to ensure the safety and good order of the unit.
