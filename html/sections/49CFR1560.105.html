                                Sec.  1560.105  Denial of transport or sterile area access;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to each covered aircraft  operator beginning on the date that TSA assumes the watch list matching  function for the passengers and non-traveling individuals to whom that  covered aircraft operator issues a boarding pass or other authorization  to enter a sterile area. TSA will provide prior written notification to  the covered aircraft operator no later than 60 days before the date on  which it will assume the watch list matching function from that covered  aircraft operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to the date that TSA assumes the watch list matching  function from a covered aircraft operator, the covered aircraft operator  must comply with existing watch list matching procedures for passengers  and non-traveling individuals, including denial of transport or sterile  area access or designation for enhanced screening for individuals  identified by the covered aircraft operator or TSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>  of this section, a covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding  pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to a passenger or a  non-traveling individual, and must not allow that individual to board an  aircraft or enter a sterile area, until TSA informs the covered aircraft  operator of the results of watch list matching for that passenger or  non-traveling individual, in response to the covered aircraft operator's  most recent SFPD submission for that passenger or non-traveling  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Denial of boarding pass. If TSA sends a covered aircraft  operator a boarding pass printing result that says the passenger or non- traveling individual must be placed on inhibited status, the covered  aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or other authorization  to enter a sterile area to that individual and must not allow that  individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Selection for enhanced screening. If TSA sends a covered  aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the  passenger has been selected for enhanced screening at a security  checkpoint, the covered aircraft operator may issue a boarding pass to  that individual and must identify the individual for enhanced screening,  in accordance with procedures approved by TSA. The covered aircraft  operator must place a code on the boarding pass that meets the  requirements described in the Consolidated User Guide. If TSA sends a  covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the  non-traveling individual has been selected for enhanced screening at a  security checkpoint, the covered aircraft operator must not issue an  authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cleared for boarding or entry into a sterile area. If TSA sends  a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that  instructs a covered aircraft operator that a passenger or non-traveling  individual is cleared, the covered aircraft operator may issue a  boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to that  individual, unless required under another TSA requirement to identify  the passenger or non-traveling individual for enhanced screening or to  deny entry into the sterile area. The covered aircraft operator must  place a code on the boarding pass or authorization to enter the sterile  area that meets the requirements described in the Consolidated User  Guide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Override by a covered aircraft operator. No covered aircraft  operator may override a TSA boarding pass printing result that instructs  a covered aircraft operator to place a passenger or non-traveling  individual in an inhibited status or to identify a passenger or non- traveling individual for enhanced screening, unless explicitly  authorized by TSA to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Updated SFPD from covered aircraft operator. When a covered  aircraft operator sends updated SFPD to TSA under Sec.  1560.101(d) for  a passenger or non-traveling individual for whom TSA has already issued  a boarding pass printing result, all previous TSA results concerning the  passenger or non-traveling individual are voided. The covered aircraft  operator may not issue a boarding pass or grant authorization to enter a  sterile area until it receives an updated result from TSA authorizing  the issuance of a boarding pass or authorization to enter a sterile  area. Upon receiving an updated result from TSA, the covered aircraft  operator must acknowledge receipt of the updated result, comply with the  updated result, and disregard all previous boarding pass printing  results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Updated boarding pass printing results from TSA. After TSA sends  a covered aircraft operator a result under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or  (b)(3) of this section, TSA may receive additional information  concerning the passenger or non-traveling individual and may send an  updated boarding pass printing result concerning that passenger or non- traveling individual to the covered aircraft operator. Upon receiving an  updated boarding pass printing result from TSA, the covered aircraft  operator must acknowledge receipt of the updated result, comply with the  updated result, and disregard all previous results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Boarding pass issuance for covered flights to or overflying the  United States. Covered aircraft operators may permit another aircraft  operator to issue a boarding pass for a covered flight departing from a  foreign location to the United States or overflying the United States  without regard to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6)  of this section provided that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before allowing the individual to board the aircraft for a  covered flight, the covered aircraft operator confirms that it has  received a boarding pass printing result from DHS for individuals who  are issued boarding passes under paragraph (b)(7) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before allowing the individual to board an aircraft for a  covered flight, the covered aircraft operator applies the measures in  its security program to prevent an individual for whom DHS has returned  an inhibited status boarding pass printing result under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section from boarding the aircraft; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The covered aircraft operator applies the measures in its  security program, as provided in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B or 49 CFR  part 1546, subpart B, to ensure that an individual for whom DHS returns  a Selectee result under paragraph (b)(2) of this section undergoes  enhanced screening pursuant to the covered aircraft operator's security  program prior to that individual boarding the aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request for identification--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If TSA has not  informed the covered aircraft operator of the results of watch list  matching for an individual by the time the individual attempts to check  in, or informs the covered aircraft operator that an individual has been  placed in inhibited status, the aircraft operator must request from the  individual a verifying identity document pursuant to procedures in its  security program., as provided in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B or 49 CFR  part 1546, subpart B. The individual   must present a verifying identity document to the covered aircraft  operator at the airport.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transmission of Updated Secure Flight Passenger Data. Upon  reviewing a passenger's verifying identity document, the covered  aircraft operator must transmit the SFPD elements from the individual's  verifying identity document to TSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provision of Passenger Resolution Information. If requested by  TSA, the covered aircraft operator must also provide to TSA the  individual's Passenger Resolution Information as specified by TSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exception for minors. If a covered aircraft operator is required  to obtain information from an individual's verifying identity document  under this paragraph (c), and the individual is younger than 18 years of  age and does not have a verifying identity document, TSA may, on a case- by-case basis, authorize the minor or an adult accompanying the minor to  state the individual's full name and date of birth in lieu of providing  a verifying identity document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to obtain identification. If a passenger or non- traveling individual does not present a verifying identity document when  requested by the covered aircraft operator, in order to comply with  paragraph (c) of this section, the covered aircraft operator must not  issue a boarding pass or give authorization to enter a sterile area to  that individual and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft  or enter a sterile area, unless otherwise authorized by TSA.</p>
