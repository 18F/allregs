                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Limbs assembly. The limbs consist of the assemblies designated  as SA 106C 041, SA 106C 042, SA 106C 071, and SA 106C 072, on drawing  No. SA 106C 001, sheet 2, and conform to each applicable drawing listed  on SA 106C 001, sheets 14 through 17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limbs assembly impact response requirement. When each knee is  impacted at 7.0 0.1 fps, according to paragraph  (c) of this section, the maximum force on the femur shall not be more  than 1060 pounds and not less than 780 pounds, with a duration above 400  pounds of not less than 0.8 milliseconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limbs test procedure. The test procedure for the limbs is as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Seat and orient the dummy without back support on a seating  surface that is 11 0.2 inches above a horizontal  (floor) surface as specified in Sec. 572.78(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Orient the dummy as specified in Figure 43 with the hip joint  adjustment at any setting between 1g and 2g.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Place the dummy legs in a plane parallel to the dummy's  midsagittal plane with the knee pivot center line perpendicular to the  dummy's midsagittal plane, and with the feet flat on the horizontal  (floor) surface.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Adjust the feet and lower legs until the line between the  midpoint of   each knee pivot and each ankle pivot is within 2 degrees of the  vertical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If necessary, reposition the dummy so that at the level one inch  below the seating surface, the rearmost point of the dummy's lower legs  remains not less than 3 inches and not more than 6 inches forward of the  forward edge of the seat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Align the test probe specified in Sec. 572.77(a) with the  longitudinal center line of the femur force gauge, so that at impact,  the probe's longitudinal center line coincides with the sensor's  longitudinal center line within 2 degrees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Impact the knee with the test probe moving horizontally and  parallel to the midsagittal plane at the specified velocity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no  significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.</p>
