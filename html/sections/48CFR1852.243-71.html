                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1843.7102, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Shared Savings (MAR 1997)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor is entitled, under the provisions of this clause,  to share in cost savings resulting from the implementation of cost  reduction projects which are presented to the Government in the form of  Cost Reduction Proposals (CRP) and approved by the Contracting Officer.  These cost reduction projects may require changes to the terms,  conditions or statement of work of this contract. Any cost reduction  projects must not change the essential function of any products to be  delivered or the essential purpose of services to be provided under the  contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cost savings, as contemplated by this clause mean savings that  result from instituting changes to the covered contract, as identified  in an approved Cost Reduction Proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost Reduction Proposal--For the purposes of this clause, a Cost  Reduction Proposal means a proposal that recommends alternatives to the  established procedures and/or organizational support of a contract or  group of contracts. These alternatives must result in a net reduction of  contract cost and price to NASA. The proposal will include technical and  cost information sufficient to enable the Contracting Officer to  evaluate the CRP and approve or disapprove it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Covered contract--As used in this provision, covered contract  means the contract, including unexercised options but excluding future  contracts, whether contemplated or not, against which the CRP is  submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contractor implementation costs--As used in this provision,  Contractor implementation costs, or ``implementation costs'', shall mean  those costs which the Contractor incurs on covered contracts  specifically in developing, preparing, submitting, and negotiating a  CRP, as well as those costs the Contractor will incur on covered  contracts to make any structural or organizational changes in order to  implement an approved CRP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Government costs--As used in this provision, the term Government  costs means internal costs of NASA, or any other Government agency,  which result directly from development and implementation of the CRP.  These may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with the  administration of the contract or with such contractually related  functions such as testing, operations, maintenance and logistics  support. These costs also include costs associated with other Agency  contracts (including changes in contract price or cost and fee) that may  be affected as a result of the implementation of a CRP. They do not  include the normal administrative costs of reviewing and processing the  Cost Reduction Proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General. The Contractor will develop, prepare and submit CRP's  with supporting information as detailed in paragraph (e) of this clause,  to the Contracting Officer. The CRP will describe the proposed cost  reduction activity in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting  Officer to evaluate it and to approve or disapprove it. The Contractor  shall share in any net cost savings realized from approved and  implemented CRPs in accordance with the terms of this clause. The  Contractor's actual percentage share of the cost savings shall be a  matter for negotiation with the Contracting Officer, but shall not, in  any event, exceed 50 percent of the total cost savings recognized by the  Contracting Officer. The Contractor may propose changes in other  activities that impact performance on its contract, including Government  and other Contractor operations, if   such changes will optimize cost savings. A Contractor shall not be  entitled to share, however, in any cost savings that are internal to the  Government, or which result from changes made to any contracts to which  it is not a party even if those changes were proposed as a part of its  CRP. Early communication between the Contractor and Government is  encouraged. The communication may be in the form of a concept paper or  preliminary proposal. The Government is not committed to accepting any  proposal as a result of these early discussions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Computation of cost savings. The cost savings to be shared  between the Government and the Contractor will be computed by the  Contracting Officer by comparing a current estimate to complete (ETC)  for the covered contract, as structured before implementation of the  proposed CRP, to a revised ETC which takes into account the  implementation of that CRP. The cost savings to be shared shall be  reduced by any cost overrun, whether experienced or projected, that is  identified on the covered contract before implementation of the CRP.  Although a CRP may result in cost savings that extend far into the  future, the period in which the Contractor may share in those savings  will be limited to no more than five years. Implementation costs of the  Contractor must be considered and specifically identified in the revised  ETC. The Contracting Officer shall offset Contractor cost savings by any  increased costs (whether implementing or recurring) to the Government  when computing the total cost savings to be shared. The Contractor shall  not be entitled, under the provisions of this clause, to share in any  cost reductions to the contract that are the result of changes stemming  from any action other than an approved CRP. However, this clause does  not limit recovery of any such reimbursements that are allowed as a  result of other contract provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Supporting information. As a minimum, the Contractor shall  provide the following supporting information with each CRP:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the current contract requirements or  established procedures and/or organizational support which are proposed  to be changed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the difference between the current process or  procedure and the proposed change. This description shall address how  proposed changes will meet NASA requirements and discuss the advantages  and disadvantages of the existing practice and the proposed changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A list of contract requirements which must be revised, if any,  if the CRP is approved, along with proposed revisions. Any changes to  NASA or delegated contract management processes should also be  addressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Detailed cost estimates which reflect the implementation costs  of the CRP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An updated ETC for the covered contract, unchanged, and a  revised ETC for the covered contract which reflects changes resulting  from implementing the CRP. If the CRP proposes changes to only a limited  number of elements of the contract, the ETCs need only address those  portions of the contract that have been impacted. Each ETC shall depict  the level of costs incurred or to be incurred by year, or to the level  of detail required by the Contracting Officer. If other CRPs have been  proposed or approved on a contract, the impact of these CRPs must be  addressed in the computation of the cost savings to ensure that the cost  savings identified are attributable only to the CRP under consideration  in the instant case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identification of any other previous submissions of the CRP,  including the dates submitted, the agencies and contracts involved, and  the disposition of those submittals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Administration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall submit proposed CRPs to  the Contracting Officer who shall be responsible for the review,  evaluation and approval. Normally, CRP's should not be entertained for  the first year of performance to allow the Contracting Officer to assess  performance against the basic requirements. If a cost reduction project  impacts more than a single contract, the Contractor may, upon  concurrence of the Contracting Officers responsible for the affected  contracts, submit a single CRP which addresses fully the cost savings  projected on all affected contracts that contain this Shared Savings  Clause. In the case of multiple contracts affected, responsibility for  the review and approval of the CRP will be a matter to be decided by the  affected Contracting Officers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days of receipt, the Contracting Officer shall  complete an initial evaluation of any proposed cost reduction plan to  determine its feasibility. Failure of the Contracting Officer to provide  a response within 60 days shall not be construed as approval of the CRP.  The Government shall promptly notify the Contractor of the results of  its initial evaluation and indicate what, if any, further action will be  taken. If the Government determines that the proposed CRP has merit, it  will open discussions with the Contractor to establish the cost savings  to be recognized, the Contractor's share of the cost savings, and a  payment schedule. The Contractor shall continue to perform in accordance  with the terms and conditions of the existing contract until a contract  modification is executed by the Contracting Officer. The modification  shall constitute approval of the CRP and shall incorporate the changes  identified by the CRP, adjust the contract cost and/or price, establish  the Contractor's share of cost savings, and incorporate the agreed to  payment schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor will receive payment by submitting invoices to  the Contracting Officer for approval. The amount and timing of  individual payments will be made in accordance with the schedule to be  established with the Contracting Officer. Notwithstanding the overall  savings recognized by the Contracting Officer as a result of an approved  CRP, payment of any portion of the Contractor's share of savings shall  not be made until NASA begins to realize a net cost savings on the  contract (i.e., implementation, startup and other increased costs  resulting from the change have been offset by cumulative cost savings).  Savings associated with unexercised options will not be paid unless and  until the contract options are exercised. It shall be the responsibility  of the Contractor to provide such justification as the Contracting  Officer deems necessary to substantiate that cost savings are being  achieved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any future activity, including a merger or acquisition  undertaken by the Contractor (or to which the Contractor becomes an  involved party), which has the effect of reducing or reversing the cost  savings realized from an approved CRP for which the Contractor has  received payment may be cause for recomputing the net cost savings  associated with any approved CRP. The Government reserves the right to  make an adjustment to the Contractor's share of cost savings and to  receive a refund of moneys paid if necessary. Such adjustment shall not  be made without notifying the Contractor in advance of the intended  action and affording the Contractor an opportunity for discussion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Limitations. Contract requirements that are imposed by statute  shall not be targeted for cost reduction exercises. The Contractor is  precluded from receiving reimbursements under both this clause and other  incentive provisions of the contract, if any, for the same cost  reductions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Disapproval of, or failure to approve, any proposed cost  reduction proposal shall not be considered a dispute subject to remedies  under the Disputes clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Cost savings paid to the Contractor in accordance with the  provisions of this clause do not constitute profit or fee within the  limitations imposed by 10 U.S.C. 2306(d) and 41 U.S.C. 254(b).</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [62 FR 14033, Mar. 25, 1997]</p>
