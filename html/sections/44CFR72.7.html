                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Resubmittals of CLOMA, CLOMR, CLOMR-F, LOMR, LOMR-F, or PMR  requests more than 90 days after FEMA notification that the requests  were denied or after FEMA ended its review because the requester  provided insufficient information will be treated as original  submissions and subject to all submittal/payment procedures described in  Sec. 72.4. The procedure in Sec. 72.4 also applies to a resubmitted  request (regardless of when submitted) if the project on which the  request is based has been altered significantly in design or scope other  than as necessary to respond to comments, concerns, or other findings  made by FEMA regarding the original submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When LOMR, LOMR-F, or PMR requests are made after FEMA issues  CLOMRs or CLOMR-Fs, the procedures in Sec. 72.4 and the appropriate fee  apply, as referenced in Sec. 72.3(c). When the as-built conditions  differ from the proposed conditions on which FEMA issued the CLOMRs or  CLOMR-Fs, the reduced fee for as-built requests will not apply.  [62 FR 5738, Feb. 6, 1997]</p>
