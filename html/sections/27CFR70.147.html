                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is not valid  as against another lien or security interest, the priority of the other  lien or security interest also extends to each of the following items to  the extent that under local law the item has the same priority as the  lien or security interest to which it relates:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any interest or carrying charges (including finance, service,  and similar charges) upon the obligation secured,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reasonable charges and expenses of an indenture trustee  (including, for example, the trustee under a deed of trust) or agent  holding the security interest for the benefit of the holder of the  security interest,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reasonable expenses, including reasonable compensation for  attorneys, actually incurred in collecting or enforcing the obligation  secured,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The reasonable costs of insuring, preserving, or repairing the  property to which the lien or security interest relates,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The reasonable costs of insuring payment of the obligation  secured (including amounts paid by the holder of the security interest  for mortgage insurance, such as that issued by the Federal Housing  Administration), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Amounts paid to satisfy any lien on the property to which the  lien or security interest relates, but only if the lien so satisfied is  entitled to priority over the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collection expenses. The reasonable expenses described in  paragraph (a)(3) of this section include expenditures incurred by the  protected holder of the lien or security interest to establish the  priority of the holder's interest or to collect, by foreclosure or  otherwise, the amount due the holder from the property subject to the  protected holder's lien. Accordingly, the amount of the encumbrance  which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder  of the security interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Costs of insuring, preserving, etc. The reasonable costs of  insuring, preserving, or repairing described in paragraph (a)(4) of this  section include expenditures by the holder of a security interest for  fire and casualty insurance on the property subject to the security  interest and amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest  to repair the property. Such reasonable costs also include the amounts  paid by the holder of the lien or security interest in a leasehold to  the lessor of the leasehold to preserve the leasehold subject to the  lien or security interest. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or  security interest which is protected is increased by the amounts so  expended by the holder of the lien or security interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Satisfaction of liens. The amounts described in paragraph (a)(6)  of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of  a lien or security interest to discharge a statutory lien for State  sales taxes on the property subject to the lien or security interest if  both the lien or security interest and the sales tax lien have priority  over a Federal tax lien. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security  interest is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the  lien or security interest even though under local law the holder of the  lien or security interest is not subrogated to the rights of the holder  of the State sales tax lien. However, if the holder of the lien or  security interest is subrogated, within the meaning of Sec. 70.144(b)  of this part, to the rights of the holder of the sales tax lien, the  holder of the lien or security interest will also be entitled to any  additional protection afforded by 26 U.S.C. 6323(i)(2)  (26 U.S.C. 6323).</p>
