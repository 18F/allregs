Sec.  301.89-15  Compensation for growers, handlers, and seed companiesin the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.</p><p class="depth0">Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first regulated crop season. Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued after the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in Oklahoma during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive compensation if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that meets the above requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under the first regulated crop season are eligible for compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop season wheat and for wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold at the time the area became regulated. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, wheat held back from harvest by a grower in the 2000-2001 growing season for use as seed in the next growing season, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Growers. Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual price received by the grower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was determined in the contract after the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated

for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs.

Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas will not be eligible for compensation for wheat from the 2001-2002 and subsequent crop seasons; except that, for growers or handlers of wheat harvested in any field in the Texas counties of Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young during the 2000-2001 crop season that has not been found to contain a bunted wheat kernel, this requirement applies to compensation for wheat from the 2002-2003 and subsequent crop seasons. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Growers. Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> To claim compensation.
