These rates may be for  periods longer than a year if rates are sufficiently stable to justify a  longer period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements  annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may be approved for periods  longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be  sufficiently stable to justify a longer rate period.
