                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rigging equipment for material handling shall be  inspected prior to use on each shift and as necessary during its use to  ensure that it is safe. Defective rigging equipment shall be removed  from service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employers must ensure that rigging equipment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has permanently affixed and legible identification markings as  prescribed by the manufacturer that indicate the recommended safe  working load;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not be loaded in excess of its recommended safe working load as  prescribed on the identification markings by the manufacturer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not be used without affixed, legible identification markings,  required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rigging equipment, when not in use, shall be removed from the  immediate work area so as not to present a hazard to employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special custom design grabs, hooks, clamps, or other lifting  accessories, for such units as modular panels, prefabricated structures  and similar materials, shall be marked to indicate the safe working  loads and shall be proof-tested prior to use to 125 percent of their  rated load.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Scope. This section applies to slings used in conjunction with  other material handling equipment for the movement of material by  hoisting, in employments covered by this part. The types of slings  covered are those made from alloy steel chain, wire rope, metal mesh,  natural or synthetic fiber rope (conventional three strand  construction), and synthetic web (nylon, polyester, and polypropylene).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inspections. Each day before being used, the sling and all  fastenings and attachments shall be inspected for damage or defects by a  competent person designated by the employer. Additional inspections  shall be performed during sling use, where service conditions warrant.  Damaged or defective slings shall be immediately removed from service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alloy steel chains. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Welded alloy steel chain slings shall  have permanently affixed durable identification stating size, grade,  rated capacity, and sling manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hooks, rings, oblong links, pear-shaped links, welded or  mechanical coupling links, or other attachments, when used with alloy  steel chains, shall have a rated capacity at least equal to that of the  chain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Job or shop hooks and links, or makeshift fasteners, formed from  bolts, rods, etc., or other such attachments, shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employers must not use alloy steel-chain slings with loads in  excess of the rated capacities (i.e., working load limits) indicated on  the sling by permanently affixed and legible identification markings  prescribed by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whenever wear at any point of any chain link exceeds that shown  in Table H-1, the assembly shall be removed from service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inspections. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the inspection required by other  paragraphs of this section, a thorough periodic inspection of alloy  steel chain slings in use shall be made on a regular basis, to be  determined on the basis of (A) frequency of sling use; (B) severity of  service conditions; (C) nature of lifts being made; and (D) experience  gained on the service life of slings used in similar circumstances. Such  inspections shall in no event be at intervals greater than once every 12  months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall make and maintain a record of the most  recent month in which each alloy steel chain sling was thoroughly  inspected, and shall make such record available for examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wire rope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employers must not use improved plow-steel wire  rope and wire-rope slings with loads in excess of the rated capacities  (i.e., working load limits) indicated on the sling by permanently  affixed and legible identification markings prescribed by the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Protruding ends of strands in splices on slings and bridles  shall be covered or blunted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wire rope shall not be secured by knots, except on haul back  lines on scrapers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following limitations shall apply to the use of wire rope:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An eye splice made in any wire rope shall have not less than  three full tucks. However, this requirement shall not operate to  preclude the use of another form of splice or connection which can be  shown to be as efficient and which is not otherwise prohibited.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except for eye splices in the ends of wires and for endless  rope slings, each wire rope used in hoisting or lowering, or in pulling  loads, shall consist of one continuous piece without knot or splice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Eyes in wire rope bridles, slings, or bull wires shall not be  formed by wire rope clips or knots.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Wire rope shall not be used if, in any length of eight  diameters, the total number of visible broken wires exceeds 10 percent  of the total number of wires, or if the rope shows other signs of  excessive wear, corrosion, or defect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When U-bolt wire rope clips are used to form eyes, Table H-2  shall be used to determine the number and spacing of clips.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When used for eye splices, the U-bolt shall be applied so that  the ``U'' section is in contact with the dead end of the rope.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Slings shall not be shortened with knots or bolts or other  makeshift devices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Sling legs shall not be kinked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Slings used in a basket hitch shall have the loads balanced to  prevent slippage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Slings shall be padded or protected from the sharp edges of  their loads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Hands or fingers shall not be placed between the sling and its  load while the sling is being tightened around the load.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Shock loading is prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A sling shall not be pulled from under a load when the load is  resting on the sling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Minimum sling lengths. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cable laid and 6 x 19 and 6 x 37  slings shall have a minimum clear length of wire rope 10 times the  component rope diameter between splices, sleeves or end fittings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Braided slings shall have a minimum clear length of wire rope  40 times the component rope diameter between the loops or end fittings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Cable laid grommets, strand laid grommets and endless slings  shall have a minimum circumferential length of 96 times their body  diameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Safe operating temperatures. Fiber core wire rope slings of all  grades shall be permanently removed from service if they are exposed to  temperatures in excess of 200 [deg]F (93.33 [deg]C). When nonfiber core  wire rope slings of any grade are used at temperatures above 400 [deg]F  (204.44 [deg]C) or below minus 60 [deg]F (15.55 [deg]C), recommendations  of the sling manufacturer regarding use at that temperature shall be  followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> End attachments. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Welding of end attachments, except covers  to thimbles, shall be performed prior to the assembly of the sling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All welded end attachments shall not be used unless proof  tested by the manufacturer or equivalent entity at twice their rated  capacity prior to initial use. The employer shall retain a certificate  of the proof test, and make it available for examination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Wire rope slings shall have permanently affixed, legible  identification markings stating size, rated capacity for the type(s) of  hitch(es) used and the angle upon which it is based, and the number of  legs if more than one.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Natural rope, and synthetic fiber. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employers must not use  natural- and synthetic-fiber rope slings with loads in excess of the  rated capacities (i.e., working load limits) indicated on the sling by  permanently affixed and legible identification markings prescribed by  the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All splices in rope slings provided by the employer shall be  made in accordance with fiber rope manufacturers recommendations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In manila rope, eye splices shall contain at least three full  tucks, and short splices shall contain at least six full tucks (three on  each side of the centerline of the splice).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In layed synthetic fiber rope, eye splices shall contain at  least four full tucks, and short splices shall contain at least eight  full tucks (four on each side of the centerline of the splice).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Strand end tails shall not be trimmed short (flush with the  surface of the rope) immediately adjacent to the full tucks. This  precaution applies to both eye and short splices and all types of fiber  rope. For fiber ropes under 1-inch diameter, the tails shall project at  least six rope diameters beyond the last full tuck. For fiber ropes 1- inch diameter and larger, the tails shall project at least 6 inches  beyond the last full tuck. In applications where the projecting tails  may be objectionable, the tails shall be tapered and spliced into the  body of the rope using at least two additional tucks (which will require  a tail length of approximately six rope diameters beyond the last full  tuck).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For all eye splices, the eye shall be sufficiently large to  provide an included angle of not greater than 60[deg] at the splice when  the eye is placed over the load or support.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Knots shall not be used in lieu of splices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Safe operating temperatures. Natural and synthetic fiber rope  slings, except for wet frozen slings, may be used in a temperature range  from minus 20 [deg]F (-28.88 [deg]C) to plus 180 [deg]F (82.2 [deg]C)  without decreasing the working load limit. For operations outside this  temperature range and for wet frozen slings, the sling manufacturer's  recommendations shall be followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Splicing. Spliced fiber rope slings shall not be used unless  they have been spliced in accordance with the following minimum  requirements and in accordance with any additional recommendations of  the manufacturer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In manila rope, eye splices shall consist of at least three full  tucks, and short splices shall consist of at least six full tucks, three  on each side of the splice center line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In synthetic fiber rope, eye splices shall consist of at least  four full tucks, and short splices shall consist of at least eight full  tucks, four on each side of the center line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Strand end tails shall not be trimmed flush with the surface  of the rope immediately adjacent to the full tucks. This applies to all  types of fiber rope and both eye and short splices. For fiber rope under  1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter, the tail shall project at least six rope  diameters beyond the last full tuck. For fiber rope 1 inch (2.54 cm) in  diameter and larger, the tail shall project at least 6 inches (15.24 cm)  beyond the last full tuck. Where a projecting tail interferes with the  use of the sling, the tail shall be tapered and spliced into the body of  the rope using at least two additional tucks (which will require a tail  length of approximately six rope diameters beyond the last full tuck).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fiber rope slings shall have a minimum clear length of rope  between eye splices equal to 10 times the rope diameter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Knots shall not be used in lieu of splices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Clamps not designed specifically for fiber ropes shall not be  used for splicing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> For all eye splices, the eye shall be of such size to provide  an included angle of not greater than 60 degrees at the splice when the  eye is placed over the load or support.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> End attachments. Fiber rope slings shall not be used if end  attachments in contact with the rope have sharp edges or projections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Removal from service. Natural and synthetic fiber rope slings  shall be immediately removed from service if any of the following  conditions are present:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Abnormal wear.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Powdered fiber between strands.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Broken or cut fibers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Variations in the size or roundness of strands.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Discoloration or rotting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Distortion of hardware in the sling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Employers must use natural- and synthetic-fiber rope slings that  have permanently affixed and legible identification markings that state  the rated capacity for the type(s) of hitch(es) used and the angle upon  which it is based, type of fiber material, and the number of legs if  more than one.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Synthetic webbing (nylon, polyester, and polypropylene). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  employer shall have each synthetic web sling marked or coded to show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name or trademark of manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rated capacities for the type of hitch.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Type of material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rated capacity shall not be exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Webbing. Synthetic webbing shall be of uniform thickness and  width and selvage edges shall not be split from the webbing's width.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fittings. Fittings shall be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Of a minimum breaking strength equal to that of the sling; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Free of all sharp edges that could in any way damage the  webbing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Attachment of end fittings to webbing and formation of eyes.  Stitching shall be the only method used to attach end fittings to  webbing and to form eyes. The thread shall be in an even pattern and  contain a sufficient number of stitches to develop the full breaking  strength of the sling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Environmental conditions. When synthetic web slings are used,  the following precautions shall be taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Nylon web slings shall not be used where fumes, vapors, sprays,  mists or liquids of acids or phenolics are present.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polyester and polypropylene web slings shall not be used where  fumes, vapors, sprays, mists or liquids of caustics are present.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Web slings with aluminum fittings shall not be used where  fumes, vapors, sprays, mists or liquids of caustics are present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Safe operating temperatures. Synthetic web slings of polyester  and nylon shall not be used at temperatures in excess of 180 [deg]F  (82.2 [deg]C). Polypropylene web slings shall not be used at  temperatures in excess of 200 [deg]F (93.33 [deg]C).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Removal from service. Synthetic web slings shall be immediately  removed from service if any of the following conditions are present:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acid or caustic burns;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Melting or charring of any part of the sling surface;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Snags, punctures, tears or cuts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Broken or worn stitches; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Distortion of fittings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Shackles and hooks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employers must not use shackles with  loads in excess of the rated capacities (i.e., working load limits)  indicated on the shackle by permanently affixed and legible  identification markings prescribed by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed in  determining the safe working loads of the various sizes and types of  specific and identifiable hooks. All hooks for which no applicable  manufacturer's recommendations are available shall be tested to twice  the intended safe working load before they are initially put into use.  The employer shall maintain a record of the dates and results of such  tests.</p><p class="depth3">Table H-1--Maximum Allowable Wear at any Point of Link ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Maximum</p><p class="depth3">allowable</p><p class="depth3">Chain size (inches)                         wear</p><p class="depth3"><em>(inch)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1/4\.......................................................      \3/64\ \3/8\.......................................................      \5/64\ \1/2\.......................................................      \7/64\ \5/8\.......................................................      \9/64\ \3/4\.......................................................      \5/32\ \7/8\.......................................................     \11/64\ 1...........................................................      \3/16\ 1\1/8\......................................................      \7/32\ 1\1/4\......................................................       \1/4\ 1\3/8\......................................................      \9/32\ 1\1/2\......................................................      \5/16\ 1\3/4\......................................................     \11/32\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Table H-2--Number and Spacing of U-Bolt Wire Rope Clips ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Number of clips</p><p class="depth3">Improved plow steel, rope diameter    --------------------   Minimum</p><p class="depth3"><em>(inches)</em>                    Drop      Other     spacing</p><p class="depth3">forged   material   (inches) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1/2\...................................         3         4           3 \5/8\...................................         3         4      3\3/4\ \3/4\...................................         4         5      4\1/2\ \7/8\...................................         4         5      5\1/4\ 1.......................................         5         6           6 1\1/8\..................................         6         6      6\3/4\ 1\1/4\..................................         6         7      7\1/2\ 1\3/8\..................................         7         7      8\1/4\ 1\1/2\..................................         7         8           9 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   [44 FR 8577, Feb. 9, 1979; 44 FR 20940, Apr. 6, 1979, as amended at 58  FR 35173, June 30, 1993; 76 FR 33611, June 8, 2011; 77 FR 23118, Apr.  18, 2012]</p>
