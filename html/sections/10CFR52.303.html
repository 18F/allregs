Appendix A to Part 52--Design Certification Rule for the U.S.</p><p class="depth0">Advanced Boiling Water Reactor</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">A. Appendix A constitutes the standard design certification for the U.S. Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (U.S. ABWR) design, in accordance with 10 CFR part 52, subpart B. The applicant for the original certification of the U.S. ABWR design was GE Nuclear Energy (GE).</p><p class="depth0">B. The applicant for the amendment to the U.S. ABWR design to address the requirements in 10 CFR 50.150, ``Aircraft impact assessment,'' (AIA rule) is the STP Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC).</p><p class="depth0">II. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means either or both of the documents containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical specifications that are incorporated by reference into this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">B. Generic technical specifications means the information, required by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a, for the portion of the plant that is within the scope of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">C. Plant-specific DCD means the document, maintained by an applicant or licensee who references this appendix, consisting of the information in the generic DCD, as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this appendix (hereinafter Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 information. Tier 1 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions and general provisions;</p><p class="depth0">2. Design descriptions;</p><p class="depth0">3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);</p><p class="depth0">4. Significant site parameters; and</p><p class="depth0">5. Significant interface requirements.</p><p class="depth0">E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the change process in Section

VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 1. Tier 2 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with the exception of generic technical specifications and conceptual design information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC have been met; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, these items are not requirements for the licensee unless such items are restated in the FSAR.</p><p class="depth0">F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some Tier 2* information under Section VIII.B.6.</p><p class="depth0">G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Changing any of the elements of the method described in the plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative or essentially the same; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to another method unless that method has been approved by NRC for the intended application.</p><p class="depth0">H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 CFR 50.2 or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">III.

Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 52.7 are present.</p><p class="depth0">4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The Commission will deny a request for an exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.</p><p class="depth0">5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 information, Tier 2* information, or the technical specifications, or requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.</p><p class="depth0">b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific DCD or one affecting information required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(28) to address 10 CFR 50.150, requires a license amendment if it would:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a malfunction of a SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to safety with a different

result than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses.</p><p class="depth0">c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific DCD, requires a license amendment if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become credible; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.</p><p class="depth0">d. If an applicant or licensee proposes to depart from the information required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(28) to be included in the FSAR for the standard design certification, then the applicant or licensee shall consider the effect of the changed feature or capability on the original assessment required by 10 CFR 50.150(a). The applicant or licensee must also document how the modified design features and functional capabilities continue to meet the assessment requirements in 10 CFR 50.150(a)(1) in accordance with section X of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">e.

Sec. Appendix B to Part 52--Design Certification Rule for the System 80+</p><p class="depth0">Design</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B constitutes design certification for the System 80+ \1\ standard plant design, in accordance with 10 CFR part 52, subpart B. The applicant for certification of the System 80+ design was Combustion Engineering, Inc. (ABB-CE), which is now Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ ``System 80+'' is a trademark of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">II. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">B. Generic technical specifications means the information, required by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a, for the portion of the plant that is within the scope of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">C. Plant-specific DCD means the document, maintained by an applicant or licensee who references this appendix, consisting of

the information in the generic DCD, as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this appendix (hereinafter Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 information. Tier 1 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions and general provisions;</p><p class="depth0">2. Design descriptions;</p><p class="depth0">3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);</p><p class="depth0">4. Significant site parameters; and</p><p class="depth0">5. Significant interface requirements.</p><p class="depth0">E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 1. Tier 2 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with the exception of generic technical specifications and conceptual design information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC have been met; and</p><p class="depth0">3. Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, these items are not requirements for the licensee unless such items are restated in the FSAR.</p><p class="depth0">F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some Tier 2* information under Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Changing any of the elements of the method described in the plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative or essentially the same; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to another method unless that method has been approved by NRC for the intended application.</p><p class="depth0">H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 CFR 50.2 or 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">III. Scope and Contents</p><p class="depth0">A. Tier 1, Tier 2, and the generic technical specifications in the System 80+ Design Control Document, ABB-CE, with revisions dated January 1997, are approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time this appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix, or to assure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common defense and security; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 52.7 are present.</p><p class="depth0">4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The Commission will deny a request for an exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.</p><p class="depth0">5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 information, Tier 2* information, or the technical specifications, or requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.</p><p class="depth0">b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific DCD, requires a license amendment if it would:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses.</p><p class="depth0">c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific DCD, requires a license amendment if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become credible; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.</p><p class="depth0">d. If a departure requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 50.90.</p><p class="depth0">e. A departure from Tier 2 information that is made under paragraph B.5 of this section does not require an exemption from this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">f. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 52.103(a), who believes that an applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not complied with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix when departing from Tier 2 information, may petition the NRC to admit into the proceeding such a contention. In addition to compliance with the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate that the departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix. Further, the petition must demonstrate that the change bears on an asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the case of a 10 CFR 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">6a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval.

Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements are applicable to all applicants who reference this appendix, except those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action taken under paragraphs C.3 or C.4 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Commission may require plant-specific departures on generic technical specifications and other operational requirements that were completely reviewed and approved, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD is not required and special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present. The Commission may modify or supplement generic technical specifications and other operational requirements that were not completely reviewed and approved or require additional technical specifications and other operational requirements on a plant-specific basis, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD is not required.</p><p class="depth0">4. An applicant who references this appendix may request an exemption from the generic technical specifications or other operational requirements. The Commission may grant such a request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The grant of an exemption must be subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license hearing.</p><p class="depth0">5. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 52.103(a), who believes that an operational requirement approved in the DCD or a technical specification derived from the generic technical specifications must be changed may petition to admit into the proceeding such a contention. Such petition must comply with the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309 and must demonstrate why special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present, or for compliance with the Commission's regulations in effect at the time this appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix. Any other party may file a response thereto. If, on the basis of the petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the contention. All other issues with respect to the plant-specific technical specifications or other operational requirements are subject to a hearing as part of the license proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">6. After issuance of a license, the generic technical specifications have no further effect on the plant-specific technical specifications and changes to the plant-specific technical specifications will be treated as license amendments under 10 CFR 50.90.</p><p class="depth0">IX. Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC)</p><p class="depth0">A.1 An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall perform and demonstrate conformance with the ITAAC before fuel load. With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement activities, and a licensee may proceed at its own risk with design, procurement,

construction, and preoperational activities, even though the NRC may not have found that any particular ITAAC has been met.</p><p class="depth0">2. The licensee who references this appendix shall notify the NRC that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC have been successfully completed and that the corresponding acceptance criteria have been met.</p><p class="depth0">3. In the event that an activity is subject to an ITAAC, and the applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not demonstrated that the ITAAC has been met, the applicant or licensee may either take corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC, request an exemption from the ITAAC in accordance with Section VIII of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.97(b), or petition for rulemaking to amend this appendix by changing the requirements of the ITAAC, under 10 CFR 2.802 and 52.97(b). Such rulemaking changes to the ITAAC must meet the requirements of paragraph VIII.A.1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">B.1. The NRC shall ensure that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC are performed.

Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">B. Generic technical specifications means the information required by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a for the portion of the plant that is within the scope of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">C. Plant-specific DCD means the document maintained by an applicant or licensee who references this appendix consisting of the information in the generic DCD as modified and supplemented by the plant-specific departures and exemptions made under Section VIII of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this appendix (Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 information. Tier 1 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions and general provisions;</p><p class="depth0">2. Design descriptions;</p><p class="depth0">3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC);</p><p class="depth0">4.

Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in Section III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 1. Tier 2 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Information required by Sec.

Combined license (COL) action items (COL license information), which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-specific portion of the final safety analysis report (FSAR) by an applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, these items are not requirements for the licensee unless such items are restated in the FSAR.</p><p class="depth0">4. The investment protection short-term availability controls in Section 16.3 of the DCD.</p><p class="depth0">F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in Section VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some Tier 2* information under paragraph VIII.B.6.</p><p class="depth0">G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses means:</p><p class="depth0">1. Changing any of the elements of the method described in the plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative or essentially the same; or</p><p class="depth0">2.

Generic changes to Tier 1 information are applicable to all applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action taken under paragraphs A.3 or A.4 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. Departures from Tier 1 information that are required by the Commission through plant-specific orders are governed by the requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0">4. Exemptions from Tier 1 information are governed by the requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(b)(1) and 52.98(f). The Commission will deny a request for an exemption from Tier 1, if it finds that the design change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the design.</p><p class="depth0">B. Tier 2 information.</p><p class="depth0">1. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are governed by the requirements in 10 CFR 52.63(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">2. Generic changes to Tier 2 information are applicable to all applicants or licensees who reference this appendix, except those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action taken under paragraphs B.3, B.4, B.5, or B.6 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Commission may not require new requirements on Tier 2 information by plant-specific order while this appendix is in effect under 10 CFR 52.55 or 52.61, unless:</p><p class="depth0">a. A modification is necessary to secure compliance with the Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time this appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix, or to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common defense and security; and</p><p class="depth0">b. Special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 50.12(a) are present.</p><p class="depth0">4. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may request an exemption from Tier 2 information. The Commission may grant such a request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.12(a). The Commission will deny a request for an exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.</p><p class="depth0">5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 information, Tier 2* information, or the TS, or requires a license amendment under paragraphs B.5.b or B.5.c of this section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.</p><p class="depth0">b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific DCD or one affecting information required by 10 CFR52.47(a)(28) to address 10 CFR 50.150, requires a license amendment if it would:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) important to safety and previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier as described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses.</p><p class="depth0">c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific DCD, requires a license amendment if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become credible; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.</p><p class="depth0">d. If an applicant or licensee proposes to depart from the information required by 10 CFR 52.47(a)(28) to be included in the FSAR for the standard design certification, then the applicant or licensee shall consider the effect of the changed feature or capability on the original assessment required by 10 CFR 50.150(a). The applicant or licensee must also document how the modified design features and functional capabilities continue to meet the assessment requirements in 10 CFR 50.150(a)(1) in accordance with Section X of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">e. If a departure requires a license amendment under paragraph B.5.b or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 50.90.</p><p class="depth0">f. A departure from Tier 2 information that is made under paragraph B.5 of this section does not require an exemption from this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">g. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, amendment, or renewal of a license or for operation under 10 CFR 52.103(a), who believes that an applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not complied with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix when departing from Tier 2 information, may petition to admit into the proceeding such a contention. In addition to compliance with the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate that the departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix. Further,

the petition must demonstrate that the change bears on an asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the case of a 10 CFR 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">6.a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval. The departure will not be considered a resolved issue, within the meaning of Section VI of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.63(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0">b.

Departures from Tier 2* information that are made under paragraph B.6 of this section do not require an exemption from this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">C. Operational requirements.</p><p class="depth0">1. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements that were completely reviewed and approved in the design certification rulemaking and do not require a change to a design feature in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in 10 CFR 50.109. Generic changes that require a change to a design feature in the generic DCD are governed by the requirements in paragraphs A or B of this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. Generic changes to generic TS and other operational requirements are applicable to all applicants who reference this appendix, except those for which the change has been rendered technically irrelevant by action taken under paragraphs C.3 or C.4 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Commission may require plant-specific departures on generic TS and other operational requirements that were completely reviewed and approved, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD is not required and special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present. The Commission may modify or supplement generic TS and other operational requirements that were not completely reviewed and approved or require additional TS and other operational requirements on a plant-specific basis, provided a change to a design feature in the generic DCD is not required.</p><p class="depth0">4. An applicant who references this appendix may request an exemption from the generic technical specifications or other operational requirements. The Commission may grant such a request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 52.7. The grant of an

exemption must be subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license hearing.</p><p class="depth0">5. A party to an adjudicatory proceeding for either the issuance, amendment, or renewal of a license, or for operation under 10 CFR 52.103(a), who believes that an operational requirement approved in the DCD or a TS derived from the generic TS must be changed may petition to admit such a contention into the proceeding. The petition must comply with the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309 and must demonstrate why special circumstances as defined in 10 CFR 2.335 are present, or demonstrate compliance with the Commission's regulations in effect at the time this appendix was approved, as set forth in Section V of this appendix. Any other party may file a response to the petition. If, on the basis of the petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the contention. All other issues with respect to the plant-specific TS or other operational requirements are subject to a hearing as part of the license proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">6. After issuance of a license, the generic TS have no further effect on the plant-specific TS. Changes to the plant-specific TS will be treated as license amendments under 10 CFR 50.90.</p><p class="depth0">IX. Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC)</p><p class="depth0">A.1. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix shall perform and demonstrate conformance with the ITAAC before fuel load. With respect to activities subject to an ITAAC, an applicant for a license may proceed at its own risk with design and procurement activities. A licensee may also proceed at its own risk with design, procurement, construction, and preoperational activities, even though the NRC may not have found that any particular ITAAC has been met.</p><p class="depth0">2. The licensee who references this appendix shall notify the NRC that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC have been successfully completed and that the corresponding acceptance criteria have been met.</p><p class="depth0">3. If an activity is subject to an ITAAC and the applicant or licensee who references this appendix has not demonstrated that the ITAAC has been met, the applicant or licensee may either take corrective actions to successfully complete that ITAAC, request an exemption from the ITAAC under Section VIII of this appendix and 10 CFR 52.97(b), or petition for rulemaking to amend this appendix by changing the requirements of the ITAAC, under 10 CFR 2.802 and 52.97(b). Such rulemaking changes to the ITAAC must meet the requirements of paragraph VIII.A.1 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">B.1. The NRC shall ensure that the required inspections, tests, and analyses in the ITAAC are performed. The NRC shall verify that the inspections, tests, and analyses referenced by the licensee have been successfully completed and, based solely thereon, find that the prescribed acceptance criteria have been met. At appropriate intervals during construction, the NRC shall publish notices of the successful completion of ITAAC in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">2. In accordance with 10 CFR 52.103(g), the Commission shall find that the acceptance criteria in the ITAAC for the license are met before fuel load.</p><p class="depth0">3. After the Commission has made the finding required by 10 CFR 52.103(g), the ITAAC do not, by virtue of their inclusion within the DCD, constitute regulatory requirements either for licensees or for renewal of the license; except for specific ITAAC, which are the subject of a Sec. 52.103(a) hearing, their expiration will occur upon final Commission action in such a proceeding. However, subsequent modifications must comply with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 design descriptions in the plant-specific DCD unless the licensee has complied with the applicable requirements of 10 CFR 52.98 and Section VIII of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">X. Records and Reporting</p><p class="depth0">A. Records</p><p class="depth0">1. The applicant for this appendix shall maintain a copy of the generic DCD that includes all generic changes it makes to Tier 1 and Tier 2, and the generic TS and other operational requirements.

Appendix E to Part 52--Design Certification Rule for the ESBWR</p><p class="depth0">Design</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">Appendix E constitutes the standard design certification for the Economic Simplified Boiling-Water Reactor (ESBWR) design, in accordance with 10 CFR part 52, subpart B. The applicant for certification of the ESBWR design is GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy.</p><p class="depth0">II. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">A. Generic design control document (generic DCD) means the document containing the Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and generic technical specifications that is incorporated by reference into this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">B. Generic technical specifications (generic TS) means the information required by 10 CFR 50.36 and 50.36a for the portion of the plant that is within the scope of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">C. Plant-specific DCD means that portion of the combined license (COL) final safety analysis report (FSAR) that sets forth both the generic DCD information and any plant-specific changes to generic DCD information.</p><p class="depth0">D. Tier 1 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved and certified by this appendix (Tier 1 information). The design descriptions, interface requirements, and site parameters are derived from Tier 2 information. Tier 1 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions and general provisions;</p><p class="depth0">2. Design descriptions;</p><p class="depth0">3. Inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAACs);</p><p class="depth0">4. Significant site parameters; and</p><p class="depth0">5. Significant interface requirements.</p><p class="depth0">E. Tier 2 means the portion of the design-related information contained in the generic DCD that is approved but not certified by this appendix (Tier 2 information). Compliance with Tier 2 is required, but generic changes to and plant-specific departures from Tier 2 are governed by Section VIII of this appendix. Compliance with Tier 2 provides a sufficient, but not the only acceptable, method for complying with Tier 1. Compliance methods differing from Tier 2 must satisfy the change process in Section VIII of this appendix. Regardless of these differences, an applicant or licensee must meet the requirement in paragraph III.B of this appendix to reference Tier 2 when referencing Tier 1. Tier 2 information includes:</p><p class="depth0">1. Information required by Sec. Sec. 52.47(a) and 52.47(c), with the exception of generic TS and conceptual design information;</p><p class="depth0">2. Supporting information on the inspections, tests, and analyses that will be performed to demonstrate that the acceptance criteria in the ITAACs have been met;</p><p class="depth0">3. COL action items (COL license information), which identify certain matters that must be addressed in the site-specific portion of the FSAR by an applicant who references this appendix. These items constitute information requirements but are not the only acceptable set of information in the FSAR. An applicant may depart from or omit these items, provided that the departure or omission is identified and justified in the FSAR. After issuance of a construction permit or COL, these items are not requirements for

the licensee unless such items are restated in the FSAR; and</p><p class="depth0">4. The availability controls in Appendix 19ACM of the DCD.</p><p class="depth0">F. Tier 2* means the portion of the Tier 2 information, designated as such in the generic DCD, which is subject to the change process in paragraph VIII.B.6 of this appendix. This designation expires for some Tier 2* information under paragraph VIII.B.6 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">G. Departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses means:</p><p class="depth0">1. Changing any of the elements of the method described in the plant-specific DCD unless the results of the analysis are conservative or essentially the same; or</p><p class="depth0">2. Changing from a method described in the plant-specific DCD to another method unless that method has been approved by the NRC for the intended application.</p><p class="depth0">H. All other terms in this appendix have the meaning set out in 10 CFR 50.2, 10 CFR 52.1, or Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">III.

The Commission may grant such a request only if it determines that the exemption will comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.12(a). The

Commission will deny a request for an exemption from Tier 2, if it finds that the design change will result in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the design. The grant of an exemption to an applicant must be subject to litigation in the same manner as other issues material to the license hearing. The grant of an exemption to a licensee must be subject to an opportunity for a hearing in the same manner as license amendments.</p><p class="depth0">5.a. An applicant or licensee who references this appendix may depart from Tier 2 information, without prior NRC approval, unless the proposed departure involves a change to or departure from Tier 1 information, Tier 2* information, or the TS, or requires a license amendment under paragraph B.5.b or B.5.c of this section. When evaluating the proposed departure, an applicant or licensee shall consider all matters described in the plant-specific DCD.</p><p class="depth0">b. A proposed departure from Tier 2, other than one affecting resolution of a severe accident issue identified in the plant-specific DCD or one affecting information required by Sec. 52.47(a)(28) to address aircraft impacts, requires a license amendment if it would:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC) important to safety and previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to safety with a different result than any evaluated previously in the plant-specific DCD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Result in a design-basis limit for a fission product barrier as described in the plant-specific DCD being exceeded or altered; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Result in a departure from a method of evaluation described in the plant-specific DCD used in establishing the design bases or in the safety analyses.</p><p class="depth0">c. A proposed departure from Tier 2 affecting resolution of an ex-vessel severe accident design feature identified in the plant-specific DCD, requires a license amendment if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is a substantial increase in the probability of an ex-vessel severe accident such that a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed and determined to be not credible could become credible; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> There is a substantial increase in the consequences to the public of a particular ex-vessel severe accident previously reviewed.</p><p class="depth0">d. A proposed departure from Tier 2 information required by Sec. 52.47(a)(28) to address aircraft impacts shall consider the effect of the changed design feature or functional capability on the original aircraft impact assessment required by 10 CFR 50.150(a). The applicant or licensee shall describe in the plant-specific DCD how the modified design features and functional capabilities continue to meet the aircraft impact assessment requirements in 10 CFR 50.150(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">e. If a departure requires a license amendment under paragraph B.5.b or B.5.c of this section, it is governed by 10 CFR 50.90.</p><p class="depth0">f.

In addition to compliance with the general requirements of 10 CFR 2.309, the petition must demonstrate that the departure does not comply with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix. Further, the petition must demonstrate that the change bears on an asserted noncompliance with an ITAAC acceptance criterion in the case of a Sec. 52.103 preoperational hearing, or that the change bears directly on the amendment request in the case of a hearing on a license amendment. Any other party may file a response. If, on the basis of the petition and any response, the presiding officer determines that a sufficient showing has been made, the presiding officer shall certify the matter directly to the Commission for determination of the admissibility of the contention. The Commission may admit such a contention if it determines the petition raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding compliance with paragraph VIII.B.5 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">6.a. An applicant who references this appendix may not depart from Tier 2* information, which is designated with italicized text or brackets and an asterisk in the generic DCD, without NRC approval.

[79 FR 61983, Oct. 15, 2014]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendixes F-M to Part 52 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix N to Part 52--Standardization of Nuclear Power Plant</p><p class="depth0">Designs: Combined Licenses To Construct and Operate Nuclear Power</p><p class="depth0">Reactors of Identical Design at Multiple Sites</p><p class="depth0">The Commission's regulations in part 2 of this chapter specifically provide for the holding of hearings on particular issues separately from other issues involved in hearings in licensing proceedings, and for the consolidation of adjudicatory proceedings and of the presentations of parties in adjudicatory proceedings such as licensing proceedings (Sec. Sec. 2.316 and 2.317 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0">This appendix sets out the particular requirements and provisions applicable to situations in which applications for combined licenses under subpart C of this part are filed by one or more applicants for licenses to construct and operate nuclear power reactors of identical design (``common design'') to be located at multiple sites. \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ If the design for the power reactor(s) proposed in a particular application is not identical to the others, that application may not be processed under this appendix and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1. Except as otherwise specified in this appendix or as the context otherwise indicates,

the provisions of subpart C of this part and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter apply to combined license applications subject to this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this appendix must be submitted as specified in Sec. 52.75 and 10 CFR 2.101. Each application must state that the applicant wishes to have the application considered under 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and must list each of the applications to be treated together under this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3. Each application must include the information required by Sec. Sec. 52.77, 52.79, and 52.80(a), provided however, that the application must identify the common design, and, if applicable, reference a standard design certification under subpart B of this part, or the use of a reactor manufactured under subpart F of this part. The final safety analysis report for each application must either incorporate by reference or include the final safety analysis of the common design, including, if applicable, the final safety analysis report for the referenced design certification or the manufactured reactor. \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ As used in this appendix, the design of a nuclear power reactor included in a single referenced safety analysis report means the design of those structures, systems, and components important to radiological health and safety and the common defense and security.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">4. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this appendix must contain an environmental report as required by Sec. 52.80(b), and which complies with the applicable provisions of 10 CFR part 51, provided, however, that the application may incorporate by reference a single environmental report on the environmental impacts of the common design.</p><p class="depth0">5. Upon a determination that each application is acceptable for docketing under 10 CFR 2.101, each application will be docketed and a notice of docketing for each application will be published in the Federal Register, in accordance with 10 CFR 2.104, provided, however, that the notice must state that the application will be processed under the provisions of 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter. As the discretion of the Commission, a single notice of docketing for multiple applications may be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">6. The NRC staff shall prepare draft and final environmental impact statements for each of the applications under part 51 of this chapter. Scoping under 10 CFR 51.28 and 51.29 for each of the combined license applications may be conducted simultaneously and joint scoping may be conducted with respect to the environmental issues relevant to the common design.</p><p class="depth0">If the applications reference a standard design certification, then the environmental impact statement for each of the applications must incorporate by reference the design certification environmental assessment. If the applications do not reference a standard design certification, then the NRC staff shall prepare draft and final supplemental environmental impact statements which address severe accident mitigation design alternatives for the common design, which must be incorporated by reference into the environmental impact statement prepared for each application. Scoping under 10 CFR 51.28 and 51.29 for the supplemental environmental impact statement may be conducted simultaneously, and may be part of the scoping for each of the combined license applications.</p><p class="depth0">7. The ACRS shall report on each of the applications as required by Sec. 52.87. Each report must be limited to those safety matters for each application which are not relevant to the common design. In addition, the ACRS shall separately report on the safety of the common design, provided, however, that the report need not address the safety of a referenced standard design certification or reactor manufactured under subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">8. The Commission shall designate a presiding officer to conduct the proceeding with respect to the health and safety, common defense and security, and environmental matters relating to the common design. The hearing will be governed by the applicable provisions of subparts A, C, G, L, N, and O of part 2 of this chapter relating to applications for combined licenses. The presiding officer shall issue a partial initial decision on the common design.</p>
