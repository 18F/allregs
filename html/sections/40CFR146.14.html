                            <p class="depth0">This section sets forth the information which must be considered by the Director in authorizing Class I wells. For an existing or converted new Class I well the Director may rely on the existing permit file for those items of information listed below which are current and accurate in the file. For a newly drilled Class I well, the Director shall require the submission of all the information listed below. For both existing and new Class I wells certain maps, cross-sections, tabulations of wells within the area of review and other data may be included in the application by reference provided they are current, readily available to the Director (for example, in the permitting agency's files) and sufficiently identified to be retrieved. In cases where EPA issues the permit all the information in this section must be submitted to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to the issuance of a permit for an existing Class I well to operate or the construction or conversion of a new Class I well the Director shall consider the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information required in 40 CFR 144.31 and 144.31(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A map showing the injection well(s) for which a permit is sought and the applicable area of review.

The map should also show faults, if known or suspected. Only information of public record is required to be included on this map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A tabulation of data on all wells within the area of review which penetrate into the proposed injection zone.
