                            <p class="depth0">Exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are unnecessary. It  is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the presiding  officer is sought, makes known the action which the party desires the  presiding officer to take, or the party's objection to an action taken,  and the party's grounds therefor.
