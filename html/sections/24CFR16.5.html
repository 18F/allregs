                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each request received shall be acted upon promptly by the  responsible Privacy Act Officer. Every effort will be made to respond  within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the date  of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten days due to unusual  circumstances, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgement  during that period providing information on the status of the request  and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process  the request. Unusual circumstances shall include circumstances where a  search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage,  field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a  voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on  other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular  record, and cases where consultations with other agencies having a  substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grant of access--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification. An individual shall be  granted access to a record pertaining to him or her, except where the  provisions of Sec. 16.6 apply. The Privacy Act Officer shall notify the  individual of such determination and provide the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The place at which the record may be inspected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the  period of time that the records will remain available for inspection  and/or the estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed  and the estimate of fees pursuant to Sec. 16.12;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be  accompanied by another individual during personal access, subject to  procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific  record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Methods of access. The following methods of access to records by  an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given  situation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection in person may be had in the office specified by the  Privacy Act Officer granting access during hours indicated by the  Privacy Act Officer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to  the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Act Officer  determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's  access can be properly supervised at the facility, and that transmittal  of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with  operations of the Department or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of  both money and manpower; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject  to payment of the fees prescribed in Sec. 16.12. The Department, at its  own initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no  fee will be charged the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department shall supply such other information and  assistance at the time of access as to make the record intelligible to  the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department reserves the right to limit access to copies and  abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This  election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an  automated data media such as tape or disc, when the record contains  information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is  permissible under exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no  event shall original records of the Department be made available to the  individual except under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Act  Officer or his designee. It is a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate,  or destroy any record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do any  of the foregoing, Title 18, United States Code, 2701(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to  that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her  choice. Accompanied includes discussion of the record in the presence of  the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall  authorize the presence of the other individual by a signed and dated  document which includes the name of the other individual and  specifically describes the record to which access is sought. The other  individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the Privacy  Act Officer. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or  otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by another  individual during personal access to a record.</p>
