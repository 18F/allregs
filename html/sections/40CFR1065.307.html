                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and frequency. Perform linearity verification on each  measurement system listed in Table 1 of this section at least as  frequently as indicated in Table 1 of Sec.  1065.303, consistent with  measurement system manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering  judgment. The intent of linearity verification is to determine that a  measurement system responds accurately and proportionally over the  measurement range of interest. Linearity verification generally consists  of introducing a series of at least 10 reference values to a measurement  system. The measurement system quantifies each reference value. The  measured values are then collectively compared to the reference values  by using a least-squares linear regression and the linearity criteria  specified in Table 1 of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance requirements. If a measurement system does not meet  the applicable linearity criteria referenced in Table 1 of this section,  correct the deficiency by re-calibrating, servicing, or replacing  components as needed. Repeat the linearity verification after correcting  the deficiency to ensure that the measurement system meets the linearity  criteria. Before you may use a measurement system that does not meet  linearity criteria, you must demonstrate to us that the deficiency does  not adversely affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the  applicable standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure. Use the following linearity verification protocol, or  use good engineering judgment to develop a different protocol that  satisfies the intent of this section, as described in paragraph (a) of  this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In this paragraph (c), the letter ``y'' denotes a generic  measured quantity, the superscript over-bar denotes an arithmetic mean  (such as y), and the subscript ``ref'' denotes the known or  reference quantity being measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use good engineering judgment to operate a measurement system at  normal operating conditions. This may include any specified adjustment  or periodic calibration of the measurement system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If applicable, zero the instrument as you would before an  emission test   by introducing a zero signal. Depending on the instrument, this may be a  zero-concentration gas, a reference signal, a set of reference  thermodynamic conditions, or some combination of these. For gas  analyzers, use a zero gas that meets the specifications of Sec.   1065.750 and introduce it directly at the analyzer port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If applicable, span the instrument as you would before an  emission test by introducing a span signal. Depending on the instrument,  this may be a span-concentration gas, a reference signal, a set of  reference thermodynamic conditions, or some combination of these. For  gas analyzers, use a span gas that meets the specifications of Sec.   1065.750 and introduce it directly at the analyzer port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If applicable, after spanning the instrument, check zero with  the same signal you used in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Based on  the zero reading, use good engineering judgment to determine whether or  not to rezero and or re-span the instrument before continuing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For all measured quantities, use the instrument manufacturer's  recommendations and good engineering judgment to select reference  values, yrefi, that cover a range of values that you expect would  prevent extrapolation beyond these values during emission testing. We  recommend selecting a zero reference signal as one of the reference  values for the linearity verification. For pressure, temperature,  dewpoint, power, current, voltage, photoacoustic analyzers, and GC-ECD  linearity verifications, we recommend at least three reference values.  For all other linearity verifications select at least ten reference  values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Use the instrument manufacturer's recommendations and good  engineering judgment to select the order in which you will introduce the  series of reference values. For example, you may select the reference  values randomly to avoid correlation with previous measurements and to  avoid hysteresis; you may select reference values in ascending or  descending order to avoid long settling times of reference signals; or  you may select values to ascend and then descend to incorporate the  effects of any instrument hysteresis into the linearity verification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Generate reference quantities as described in paragraph (d) of  this section. For gas analyzers, use gas concentrations known to be  within the specifications of Sec.  1065.750 and introduce them directly  at the analyzer port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Introduce a reference signal to the measurement instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Allow time for the instrument to stabilize while it measures  the value at the reference condition. Stabilization time may include  time to purge an instrument and time to account for its response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> At a recording frequency of at least f Hz, specified in Table 1  of Sec.  1065.205, measure the value at the reference condition for 30  seconds (you may select a longer sampling period if the recording update  frequency is less than 0.5 Hz) and record the arithmetic mean of the  recorded values, yi. Refer to Sec.  1065.602 for an example  of calculating an arithmetic mean.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraphs (c)(9) though (11) of this  section until measurements are complete at each of the reference  conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Use the arithmetic means, yi, and reference values, yrefi, to  calculate least-squares linear regression parameters and statistical  values to compare to the minimum performance criteria specified in Table  1 of this section. Use the calculations described in Sec.  1065.602.  Using good engineering judgment, you may weight the results of  individual data pairs (i.e. (yrefi, yi,)), in the linear  regression calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> describes recommended  methods for generating reference values for the linearity-verification  protocol in paragraph (c) of this section. Use reference values that  simulate actual values, or introduce an actual value and measure it with  a reference-measurement system. In the latter case, the reference value  is the value reported by the reference-measurement system. Reference  values and reference-measurement systems must be NIST-traceable. We  recommend using calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable   within 0.5% uncertainty, if not specified elsewhere in this part 1065.  Use the following recommended methods to generate reference values or  use good engineering judgment to select a different reference:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Speed. Run the engine or dynamometer at a series of steady-state  speeds and use a strobe, photo tachometer, or laser tachometer to record  reference speeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Torque. Use a series of calibration weights and a calibration  lever arm to simulate engine torque. You may instead use the engine or  dynamometer itself to generate a nominal torque that is measured by a  reference load cell or proving ring in series with the torque- measurement system. In this case, use the reference load cell  measurement as the reference value. Refer to Sec.  1065.310 for a  torque-calibration procedure similar to the linearity verification in  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electrical power, current, and voltage. You must perform  linearity verification for either electrical power meters, or for  current and voltage meters. Perform linearity verifications using a  reference meter and controlled sources of current and voltage. We  recommend using a complete calibration system that is suitable for the  electrical power distribution industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fuel rate. Operate the engine at a series of constant fuel-flow  rates or re-circulate fuel back to a tank through the fuel flow meter at  different flow rates. Use a gravimetric reference measurement (such as a  scale, balance, or mass comparator) at the inlet to the fuel-measurement  system. Use a stopwatch or timer to measure the time intervals over  which reference masses of fuel are introduced to the fuel measurement  system. The reference fuel mass divided by the time interval is the  reference fuel flow rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Flow rates--inlet air, dilution air, diluted exhaust, raw  exhaust, or sample flow. Use a reference flow meter with a blower or  pump to simulate flow rates. Use a restrictor, diverter valve, a  variable-speed blower or a variable-speed pump to control the range of  flow rates. Use the reference meter's response as the reference values.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reference flow meters. Because the flow range requirements for  these various flows are large, we allow a variety of reference meters.  For example, for diluted exhaust flow for a full-flow dilution system,  we recommend a reference subsonic venturi flow meter with a restrictor  valve and a blower to simulate flow rates. For inlet air, dilution air,  diluted exhaust for partial-flow dilution, raw exhaust, or sample flow,  we allow reference meters such as critical flow orifices, critical flow  venturis, laminar flow elements, master mass flow standards, or Roots  meters. Make sure the reference meter is calibrated and its calibration  is NIST-traceable. If you use the difference of two flow measurements to  determine a net flow rate, you may use one of the measurements as a  reference for the other.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reference flow values. Because the reference flow is not  absolutely constant, sample and record values of nrefi for 30  seconds and use the arithmetic mean of the values, nref, as  the reference value. Refer to Sec.  1065.602 for an example of  calculating arithmetic mean.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Gas division. Use one of the two reference signals:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the outlet of the gas-division system, connect a gas analyzer  that meets the linearity verification described in this section and has  not been linearized with the gas divider being verified. For example,  verify the linearity of an analyzer using a series of reference  analytical gases directly from compressed gas cylinders that meet the  specifications of Sec.  1065.750. We recommend using a FID analyzer or a  PMD or MPD O2 analyzer because of their inherent linearity.  Operate this analyzer consistent with how you would operate it during an  emission test. Connect a span gas to the gas-divider inlet. Use the gas- division system to divide the span gas with purified air or nitrogen.  Select gas divisions that you typically use. Use a selected gas division  as the measured value. Use the analyzer response divided by the span gas  concentration as the reference gas-division value. Because the  instrument response is not absolutely constant, sample and record values  of xref for 30 seconds and use the arithmetic mean of the  values, xref, as the reference value.   Refer to Sec.  1065.602 for an example of calculating arithmetic mean.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Using good engineering judgment and the gas divider  manufacturer's recommendations, use one or more reference flow meters to  measure the flow rates of the gas divider and verify the gas-division  value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Continuous constituent concentration. For reference values, use  a series of gas cylinders of known gas concentration or use a gas- division system that is known to be linear with a span gas. Gas  cylinders, gas-division systems, and span gases that you use for  reference values must meet the specifications of Sec.  1065.750.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Temperature. You may perform the linearity verification for  temperature measurement systems with thermocouples, RTDs, and  thermistors by removing the sensor from the system and using a simulator  in its place. Use a NIST-traceable simulator that is independently  calibrated and, as appropriate, cold-junction-compensated. The simulator  uncertainty scaled to absolute temperature must be less than 0.5% of  Tmax. If you use this option, you must use sensors that the  supplier states are accurate to better than 0.5% of Tmax  compared with their standard calibration curve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Mass. For linearity verification for gravimetric PM balances,  use external calibration weights that meet the requirements in Sec.   1065.790.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Measurement systems that require linearity verification. Table 1  of this section indicates measurement systems that require linearity  verification, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform linearity verification more frequently based on the  instrument manufacturer's recommendation or good engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expression ``xmin'' refers to the reference value  used during linearity verification that is closest to zero. This is the  value used to calculate the first tolerance in Table 1 of this section  using the intercept, a0. Note that this value may be zero,  positive, or negative depending on the reference values. For example, if  the reference values chosen to validate a pressure transducer vary from  -10 to -1 kPa, xmin is -1 kPa. If the reference values used  to validate a temperature device vary from 290 to 390 K, xmin  is 290 K.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The expression ``max'' generally refers to the absolute value of  the reference value used during linearity verification that is furthest  from zero. This is the value used to scale the first and third  tolerances in Table 1 of this section using a0 and SEE. For  example, if the reference values chosen to validate a pressure  transducer vary from -10 to -1 kPa, then pmax is +10 kPa. If  the reference values used to validate a temperature device vary from 290  to 390 K, then Tmax is 390 K. For gas dividers where ``max''  is expressed as, xmax/xspan; xmax is  the maximum gas concentration used during the verification,  xspan is the undivided, undiluted, span gas concentration,  and the resulting ratio is the maximum divider point reference value  used during the verification (typically 1). The following are special  cases where ``max'' refers to a different value:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For linearity verification with a PM balance, mmax  refers to the typical mass of a PM filter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For linearity verification of torque on the engine's primary  output shaft, Tmax refers to the manufacturer's specified  engine torque peak value of the lowest torque engine to be tested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The specified ranges are inclusive. For example, a specified  range of 0.98-1.02 for a1 means 0.98<=a1<=1.02.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Linearity verification is optional for systems that pass the  flow-rate verification for diluted exhaust as described in Sec.   1065.341 (the propane check) or for systems that agree within 2% based on a chemical balance of carbon or oxygen of  the intake air, fuel, and exhaust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must meet the a1 criteria for these quantities  only if the absolute value of the quantity is required, as opposed to a  signal that is only linearly proportional to the actual value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Linearity verification is required for the following temperature  measurements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The following temperature measurements always require linearity  verification:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Air intake.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Aftertreatment bed(s), for engines tested with aftertreatment  devices subject to cold-start testing.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Dilution air for gaseous and PM sampling, including CVS, double- dilution, and partial-flow systems.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> PM sample.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Chiller sample, for gaseous sampling systems that use thermal  chillers to dry samples and use chiller temperature to calculate the  dewpoint at the outlet of the chiller. For your testing, if you choose  to use a high alarm temperature setpoint for the chiller temperature as  a constant value in determining the amount of water removed from the  emission sample, you may use good engineering judgment to verify the  accuracy of the high alarm temperature setpoint instead of linearity  verification on the chiller temperature. To verify that the alarm trip  point value is no less than 2.0 [deg]C below the reference value at the  trip point, we recommend that you input a reference simulated  temperature signal below the alarm trip point and increase this signal  until the high alarm trips.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Linearity verification is required for the following  temperature measurements if these temperature measurements are specified  by the engine manufacturer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Fuel inlet.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Air outlet to the test cell's charge air cooler air outlet, for  engines tested with a laboratory heat exchanger that simulates an  installed charge air cooler.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Coolant inlet to the test cell's charge air cooler, for engines  tested with a laboratory heat exchanger that simulates an installed  charge air cooler.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Oil in the sump/pan.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Coolant before the thermostat, for liquid-cooled engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Linearity verification is required for the following pressure  measurements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The following pressure measurements always require linearity  verification:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Air intake restriction.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Exhaust back pressure as required in Sec.  1065.130(h).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Barometer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> CVS inlet gage pressure where the raw exhaust enters the tunnel.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Sample dryer, for gaseous sampling systems that use either  osmotic-membrane or thermal chillers to dry samples. For your testing,  if you choose to use a low alarm pressure setpoint for the sample dryer  pressure as a constant value in determining the amount of water removed  from the emission sample, you may use good engineering judgment to  verify the accuracy of the low alarm pressure setpoint instead of  linearity verification on the sample dryer pressure. To verify that the  trip point value is no more than 4.0 kPa above the reference value at  the trip point, we recommend that you input a reference pressure signal  above the alarm trip point and decrease this signal until the low alarm  trips.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Linearity verification is required for the following pressure  measurements if these pressure measurements are specified by the engine  manufacturer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The test cell's charge air cooler and interconnecting pipe  pressure drop, for turbo-charged engines tested with a laboratory heat  exchanger that simulates an installed charge air cooler.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fuel outlet.</p><p class="depth5">Table 1 of Sec.   1065.307--Measurement Systems That Require Linearity Verification ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">Linearity criteria</p><p class="depth5">----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth5">Measurement system            Quantity      [verbar]xmin(a1-</p><p class="depth5">1)+a 0[verbar]         a1             SEE            r \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Speed.........................  fn.............  <= 0.05% [middot]     0.98-1.02  <= 2% [middot]</p><p class="depth5">fnmax.                           fnmax.                = 0.990 Torque........................
