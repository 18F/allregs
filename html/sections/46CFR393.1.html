                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part prescribes final regulations establishing a short sea transportation program as set forth in Sections 1121, 1122, and 1123 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, enacted into law on December 19, 2007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of America's Marine Highway Program is described in Section 1121. Section 1121 states that ``[t]he Secretary shall designate short sea transportation routes as extensions of the surface transportation system to focus public and private efforts to use the waterways to relieve landside congestion along coastal corridors.'' America's Marine Highway Program consists of four primary components:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Marine Highway Corridor Designations. This regulation establishes the goals and methods by which specific Marine Highway Corridors (including Connectors and Crossings) will be identified and designated by the Secretary of Transportation. The purpose of designating Marine Highway Corridors is to integrate America's Marine Highway into the surface transportation system. The Marine Highway Corridors will serve as extensions of the surface transportation system. They are commercial coastal, inland, and intracoastal waters of the United States, described in terms of the specific landside transportation routes (road or rail line) that they supplement. They support the movement of passengers and cargo along these specified routes and mitigate the effects of landside congestion, such as increased emissions and energy inefficiencies. In addition to corridors, the Secretary may designate Marine Highway ``Connectors'' and ``Crossings'' as described in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of Sec. 393.2. Through America's Marine Highway Program, the Department will encourage the development of multi-jurisdictional coalitions and focus public and private efforts and investment on shifting freight and passengers from at- or near capacity landside routes to more effectively utilize Marine Highway Corridors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Marine Highway Project Designations. This regulation establishes the goals and methods by which specific Marine Highway Projects will be identified and designated by the Secretary of Transportation. The purpose is to designate projects that, if successfully implemented, expanded, or otherwise enhanced, would reduce external costs and provide the greatest benefit to the public. Closely linked to congestion relief, public benefits can include, but are not limited to, reduced emissions, including greenhouse gases, reduced energy consumption, reduced costs associated with landside transportation

infrastructure maintenance savings, improved safety and transportation system resiliency and redundancy. Additional consideration will be given to Marine Highway Projects that represent the most cost-effective option among other modal improvements. Designated Marine Highway Projects may receive direct support from the Department as described in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Incentives, Impediments and Solutions. This section outlines how the Department, in partnership with public and private entities, will identify potential incentives, seek solutions to impediments to encourage utilization of America's Marine Highway and incorporate it, including ferries, in State, regional, local, and Tribal government transportation planning.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Research. This section describes the research that the Department, working with the Environmental Protection Agency, will conduct to support America's Marine Highway, within the limitations of available resources, and to encourage multi-State planning. Research would include environmental and transportation impacts (benefits and costs), technology, vessel design, and solutions to impediments to the Marine Highway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition, vessels engaged in Marine Highway operations may apply for Capital Construction Fund (CCF) benefits. This program was created to assist owners and operators of U.S.-flag vessels in accumulating the capital necessary for the modernization and expansion of the U.S. merchant marine by encouraging construction, reconstruction, or acquisition of vessels through the deferment of Federal income taxes on certain deposits of money placed into a CCF.</p>
