This  identification light signal must be located so that it does not  interfere with the visibility of the vessel's navigation lights. The  identification light signal may be used only as an identification signal  and conveys no special privilege. Vessels using the identification light  signal during public safety activities must abide by the Inland   Navigation Rules, and must not presume that the light or the exigency  gives them precedence or right of way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public safety activities include but are not limited to  patrolling marine parades, regattas, or special water celebrations;  traffic control; salvage; firefighting; medical assistance; assisting  disabled vessels; and search and rescue.
