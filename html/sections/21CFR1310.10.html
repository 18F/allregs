                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator may remove from exemption under paragraph  (1)(iv) of the definition of regulated transaction in Sec. 1300.02 of  this chapter any drug or group of drugs that the Administrator finds is  being diverted to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit  production of a controlled substance. In removing a drug or group of  drugs from the exemption the Administrator shall consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The scope, duration, and significance of the diversion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a way  that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production of a controlled  substance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from the  drug or group of drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon determining that a drug or group of drugs should be removed  from the exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, the  Administrator shall issue and publish in the Federal Register his  proposal to remove the drug or group of drugs from the exemption, which  shall include a reference to the legal authority under which the  proposal is based. The Administrator shall permit any interested person  to file written comments on or objections to the proposal. After  considering any comments or objections filed, the Administrator shall  publish in the Federal Register his final order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator shall limit the removal of a drug or group of  drugs from exemption under paragraph (a) of this section to the most  identifiable type of the drug or group of drugs for which evidence of  diversion exists unless there is evidence, based on the pattern of  diversion and other relevant factors, that the diversion will not be  limited to that particular drug or group of drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any manufacturer seeking reinstatement of a particular drug  product that has been removed from an exemption may apply to the  Administrator for reinstatement of the exemption for that particular  drug product on the grounds that the particular drug product is  manufactured and distributed in a manner that prevents diversion. In  determining whether the exemption should be reinstated the Administrator  shall consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The package sizes and manner of packaging of the drug product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manner of distribution and advertising of the drug product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of diversion of the drug product;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent diversion of  the drug product; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with the  public health and safety, including the factors described in paragraph  (a) of this section as applied to the drug product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the  application for reinstatement of the exemption, the Administrator shall  notify the applicant of his acceptance or non-acceptance of his  application, and if not accepted, the reason therefor. If the  application is accepted for filing, the Administrator shall issue and  publish in the Federal Register his order on the reinstatement of the  exemption for the particular drug product, which shall include a  reference to the legal authority under which the order is based. This  order shall specify the date on which it   shall take effect. The Administrator shall permit any interested person  to file written comments on or objections to the order. If any such  comments raise significant issues regarding any finding of fact or  conclusion of law upon which the order is based, the Administrator shall  immediately suspend the effectiveness of the order until he may  reconsider the application in light of the comments and objections  filed. Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, revoke, or amend  his original order as he determines appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless the Administrator has evidence that the drug product is  being diverted, as determined by applying the factors set forth in  paragraph (a) of this section, and the Administrator so notifies the  applicant, transactions involving a specific drug product will not be  considered regulated transactions during the following periods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> While a bonafide application for reinstatement of exemption  under paragraph (d) of this section for the specific drug product is  pending resolution, provided that the application for reinstatement is  filed not later than 60 days after the publication of the final order  removing the exemption; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For a period of 60 days following the Administrator's denial of  an application for reinstatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An order published by the Administrator in the Federal Register,  pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, to reinstate an exemption may  be modified or revoked with respect to a particular drug product upon a  finding that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applying the factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section  to the particular drug product, the drug product is being diverted; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is a significant change in the data that led to the  issuance of the final rule.
