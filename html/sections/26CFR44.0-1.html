                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The regulations in this part are designated  ``Wagering Tax Regulations.'' The regulations relate to the taxes  imposed by Chapter 35 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended,  to certain general provisions of Chapter 40 of such Code, and to certain  related administrative provisions of Subtitle F of such Code. Chapter 35  imposes an excise tax on wagers and a special tax to be paid by each  person liable for the tax imposed on wagers and by each person engaged  in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person liable for the tax  imposed on wagers. References in these regulations to the ``Internal  Revenue Code'' or the ``Code'' are references to the Internal Revenue  Code of 1954, as amended, unless otherwise indicated. References to a  section or other provision of law are references to a section or other  provision of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, unless otherwise  indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Division of regulations. The regulations in this part are  divided into five subparts. Subpart A contains provisions relating to  the arrangement and numbering of the sections of the regulations in this  part, general definitions and use of terms, scope of the regulations,  and the extent to which the regulations in this part supersede prior  regulations relating to the taxes imposed by Chapter 35 of the Internal  Revenue Code. Subpart B relates to the tax on wagers. Subpart C relates  to the special tax. Subpart D relates to certain miscellaneous and  general provisions having application to taxes imposed by Chapter 35.  Subpart E relates to selected provisions of subtitle F of the Code  (Procedure and Administration) which have special application to the  taxes imposed by Chapter 35 of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Arrangement and numbering. Each section of the regulations in  this part (other than subpart A) is designated by a number composed of  the part number followed by a decimal point (44.); the section of the  Internal Revenue Code which it interprets; a hyphen (-); and a number  identifying the section. By use of these designations one can ascertain  the sections of the regulations relating to a provision of the Code. For  example, the regulations pertaining to section 4401 of the Code are  designated Sec. Sec. 41.4401-1, 41.4401-2, and 41.4401-3.  [T.D. 6370, 24 FR 2614, Apr. 4, 1959, as amended by T.D. 7665, 45 FR  6090, Jan. 25, 1980]</p>
