(1) Cylinders, regulating and safety equipment shall be installed in a substantially constructed and firmly fixed metal enclosure located on or above the weather deck. The cylinder enclosure shall have access from the weather deck only. The enclosure shall be provided with top and bottom ventilation consisting of a fresh air inlet pipe and an exhaust pipe both entering through the top of the cylinder housing. The enclosure shall be constructed so that when the access opening is closed, no gas can escape except through the ventilation system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cylinders, regulating and safety equipment shall be installed in a substantially constructed and firmly fixed metal enclosure located on or above the weather deck.

The cylinders and high pressure equipment shall be so mounted as to be readily accessible and capable of easy removal for refilling and inspection. The stowage of high pressure equipment in the housing shall be such that the cylinder valves can be readily operated and the pressure gage dial be easily visible.

(1) All piping shall be installed so as to provide minimum interior runs and adequate flexibility. The piping at the cylinder outlets shall be fitted with flexible metallic connections to minimize the effect of cylinder movement on the outlet piping.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All piping shall be installed so as to provide minimum interior runs and adequate flexibility.

Lines shall be substantially secured against vibration by means of soft nonferrous metal clips without sharp edges in contact with the tubing. When passing through decks or bulkheads, the lines shall be protected by ferrules of nonabrasive material. The distribution lines shall be continuous length of tubes from the regulator to the shutoff valve at the appliance manifold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gas-consuming appliances.
