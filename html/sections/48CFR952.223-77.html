                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 923.7003(g), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit--Protection of Worker Safety and</p><p class="depth0">Health (DEC 2010)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payment of fee or profit (i.e., award fee,  fixed fee, and incentive fee or profit) under this contract is dependent  upon the Contractor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this  contract relating to the protection of worker safety and health (WS&H;),  including compliance with applicable law, regulation, and DOE  directives. The term ``Contractor'' as used in this clause to address  failure to comply shall mean ``Contractor or Contractor employee.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to other remedies available to the Federal  Government, if the Contractor fails to comply with the terms and  conditions of this contract relating to the protection of worker safety  and health, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally reduce the amount  of fee or profit that is otherwise payable to the Contractor in  accordance with the terms and conditions of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the  Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's  failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to worker  safety and health pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraph (c) of  this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction amount. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If in any period (see paragraph (b)(2) of  this clause) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with  contract terms and conditions relating to the protection of worker  safety and health, the Contractor's fee or profit of the period may be  reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26% nor greater than 100%  of the total fee or profit earned for a first degree performance  failure, not less than 11% nor greater than 25% for a second degree  performance failure, and up to 10% for a third degree performance  failure. The Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that  may warrant a reduction below the specified range (see 48 CFR  923.7001(b)). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to,  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the  possibility of the event in advance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contractor self-identification and response to the event to  mitigate impacts and recurrence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> General status (trend and absolute performance) of protecting  WS&H; and compliance in related areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's  satisfaction that the principles of industrial WS&H; standards are  routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program Star Status).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Event caused by ``Good Samaritan'' act by the Contractor (e.g.,  offsite emergency response).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system  is routinely used to improve and maintain WS&H; performance (including  effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision- making (e.g., policy, WS&H; programs).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and  Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous  improvement in WS&H; by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter-  and intra-DOE sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except in the case of performance based firm-fixed-price  contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) below), the Contracting Officer, for  purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract award, or as soon  as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount of fee or profit  that is available under this contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or  12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of the contract  (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the expiration date of  the contract, including all options). The amount of fee or profit to be  allocated to each period shall be equal to the average monthly fee or  profit that is available or otherwise payable during the entire term of  the contract, multiplied by the number of months established above for  each period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is  subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs,  in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the  contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not  exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in  the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the  Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative  monetary incentives in the contract for contractor violations relating  to the protection of worker safety and health.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protection of worker safety and health. Performance failures  occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's WS&H; terms  and conditions, which may be included in the DOE approved contractor  Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The degrees of performance  failure under which reductions of fee or profit will be determined are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First Degree: Performance failures that are most adverse to WS&H;  or could threaten the successful completion of a program or project. For  contracts including ISMS requirements, failure to develop and obtain  required DOE approval of WS&H; aspects of an ISMS is considered first  degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a  timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the WS&H;  aspects of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or  performance failures of similar import will be deemed first degree:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident  Investigations, or its successor).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two Second Degree performance failures during an evaluation  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second Degree: Performance failures that are significantly  adverse to WS&H.; They include failures to comply with approved WS&H;  aspects of an ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or  exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical  long-term health consequences. The following performance failures or  performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident  Investigations, or its successor).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-compliance with approved WS&H; aspects of an ISMS that  results in a near miss of a Type A or B accident. A near miss is a  situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action  is omitted, but does not result in an adverse effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to mitigate or notify DOE of an imminent danger  situation after discovery, where such notification is a requirement of  the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third Degree: Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus  on improving WS&H.; They include failures to comply with approved WS&H;  aspects of an ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the  Contractor's WS&H; system. The following performance failures or  performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address  deficiencies/non-compliance documented through external (e.g., Federal)  oversight and/or reported per DOE Manual 231.1-2, Occurrence Reporting  and Processing of Operations Information, or its successor,  requirements, or internal oversight of DOE Order 470.2B, Independent  Oversight and Performance Assurance Program, or its successor,  requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g.,  Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant WS&H; system  breakdown.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant  negative impacts to workers that indicate a significant WS&H; system  breakdown.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions  where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the  contract.</p><p class="depth4">(End of clause)  [69 FR 68780, Dec. 10, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 36369, 36370, 36378,  36380, July 22, 2009; 75 FR 69013, Nov. 10, 2010]</p>
