The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative  of the manufacturer and shall include a statement specifying the  manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and  data in support of such objections. If, after the review of the request  and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a  substantial factual issue, he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing  with respect to such issue.</p>
