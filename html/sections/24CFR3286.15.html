Along with each recommendation, the MHCC must set forth pertinent data and arguments in support of the action sought. The Secretary will either: Accept or modify the recommendation and publish it for public comment in accordance with section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), along with an explanation of the reasons for any such modification; or reject the recommendation entirely, and provide to the MHCC a written explanation of the reasons for the rejection.
