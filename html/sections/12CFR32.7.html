An eligible bank or eligible savings association must submit an application to, and receive approval from, its supervisory office before using the supplemental lending limits in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. The supervisory office may approve a completed application if it finds that approval is consistent with safety and soundness. To be deemed complete, the application must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification that the bank or savings association is an ``eligible bank'' or ``eligible savings association'';</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Citations to relevant State laws or regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of a written resolution by a majority of the bank's or savings association's board of directors approving the use of the limits provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and confirming the terms and conditions for use of this lending authority; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of how the board will exercise its continuing responsibility to oversee the use of this lending authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of approval.

The appropriate Federal banking agency may rescind a bank's or savings association's authority to use the supplemental lending limits in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section based upon concerns about credit quality, undue concentrations in the bank's or savings association's portfolio of residential real estate, small business, or small farm loans, or concerns about the bank's or savings association's overall credit risk management systems and controls. The bank or savings association must cease making new loans or extensions of credit in reliance on the supplemental lending limits upon receipt of written notice from the appropriate Federal banking agency that its authority has been rescinded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Existing loans. Any loans or extensions of credit made by a bank or savings association under the supplemental lending limits in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, that were in compliance with this section when made, will not be deemed a lending limit violation and will not be treated as nonconforming under Sec. 32.6.
