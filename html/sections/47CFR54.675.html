The aggregate annual cap on federal universal service support for health care providers shall be $400 million per funding year, of which up to $150 million per funding year will be available to support upfront payments and multi-year commitments under the Healthcare Connect Fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Funding year. A funding year for purposes of the health care providers cap shall be the period July 1 through June 30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests. Funds shall be available as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally, funds shall be available to eligible health care providers on a first-come-first-served basis, with requests accepted beginning on the first of January prior to each funding year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund, the Administrator shall implement a filing window period that treats all eligible health care providers filing within the window period as if their applications were simultaneously received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The deadline to submit a funding commitment request under the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund is June 30 for the funding year that begins on the previous July 1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Annual filing requirement.

If health care providers enter into long-term contracts for eligible services, the Administrator shall only commit funds to cover the portion of such a long-term contract scheduled to be delivered during the funding year for which universal service support is sought, except for multi-year funding commitments as described in Sec. 54.644.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pro-rata reductions for Telecommunications Program support.

with this section when a filing window period for the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is in effect. When a filing window period described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section closes, the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support submitted by all applicants during the filing window period. If the total demand during a filing window period exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, the Administrator shall take the following steps:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator shall divide the total remaining funds available for the funding year by the total amount of Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support requested by each applicant that has filed during the window period, to produce a pro-rata factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator shall calculate the amount of Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support requested by each applicant that has filed during the filing window.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Administrator shall multiply the pro-rata factor by the total dollar amount requested by each applicant filing during the window period. Administrator shall then commit funds to each applicant for Telecommunications Program and Healthcare Connect Fund support consistent with this calculation.
