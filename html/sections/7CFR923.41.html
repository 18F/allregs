                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each person who first handles cherries shall, with respect to  the cherries so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such  person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will  be incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such  person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the  total quantity of cherries handled by him as the first handler thereof  during the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of cherries  so handled by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of  assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be  required under this part throughout the period it is in effect  irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or  become inoperative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by  each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the  Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure  sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to  the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to  all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to  provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part  during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating  income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments,  the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may  also borrow money for such purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a handler does not pay any assessment within the time  prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to an  interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established by USDA  as recommended by the committee.
