                                Sec. 707.23  Requests for amendment of records.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to submit. Unless a record is not subject to amendment, per  paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, an individual may request an  amendment of a record to correct information the individual believes is  not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The request must be in  writing, labeled ``Privacy Act Request,'' and should be addressed to the  Director of Human Resources Management. The request may either be mailed  to OPIC or delivered to the receptionist at 1100 New York Avenue NW.,  Washington, DC 20527, during regular business hours, between 8:45 a.m.  and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays. The  request will be considered received when actually delivered to or, if  mailed, when it   is actually received by the Director of Human Resources Management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information to include. All requests under this section must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be in writing and be signed by the requester. Unless the  requester is a current officer or employee of OPIC, the letter must also  be duly acknowledged before a notary public or other authorized public  official or signed under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements  to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide information sufficient to verify the identity of the  requester, including the requester's full name, current address, date of  birth, place of birth, or the system of record identification name or  number. Also include a clearly legible copy of a valid form of  identification. If the request is being made by a parent or guardian on  behalf of another, also include the same information for the individual  who is the subject of the request along with a court order, birth  certificate, or similar document proving the guardianship. OPIC will  review the sufficiency of identity evidence under paragraph (c) of this  section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide information sufficient to accurately identify each  record so that OPIC staff can locate the record and information with a  reasonable amount of effort. At minimum this should include the full  name, the system of record identification name, or the system record  identification number for the individual who is the subject of the  records and the name for each system that you believe the record is  located in. Provision of a social security number is optional. If  possible, you should also include a description of the records and  provide a record creation time range. A description of OPIC's systems of  records can be located in the ``Privacy Act Compilation'' published by  the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal  Register. Each system of records is also published in the Federal  Register;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specify the correction requested; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Detail the basis for the requester's belief that the records and  information are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. This  includes providing substantial and reliable evidence sufficient to  permit OPIC to determine whether an amendment is in order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of identity. Prior to amending information about an  individual, the Director of Human Resources Management shall verify the  identity of the requesting individual. If the requester is acting as the  guardian of the individual who is the subject of the records, the  Director will also verify the identity of the individual who is the  subject of the records, the relationship between the requester and the  subject individual, and that the requester is acting on behalf of the  subject individual. In order to verify identity, the Director shall  require the individual to provide reasonable proof of identity such as a  valid driver's license, identification card, passport, employee  identification card, or any other identifying information. The Director  shall deny any request where she determines, at her sole discretion,  that the evidence offered to verify the identity of an individual is  insufficient to conclusively establish the identity of the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acknowledgment of request. If a request will take longer than  ten (10) business days to process, OPIC will send the requester an  acknowledgment letter. Any request that Director of Human Resources  Management determines does not describe records or information in enough  detail to permit the staff to promptly locate the records; does not  describe the correction requested in enough detail to permit the staff  to make a correction; or does not reasonably specify the amendment  requested or its basis will be returned without prejudice to the  requester and treated as not received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination. The Director of Human Resources Management will  provide a determination on a request under this section within thirty  (30) days from receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amendment. The Director of Human Resources Management will  notify the requester in writing if the amendment is made and provide the  individual an opportunity to request a copy of the amended record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial. The Director of Human Resources Management will notify  the requester in writing if she denies any portion of a request made  under this section. The denial will include a brief explanation of the  reason for the refusal and the right of the individual to file an appeal  within thirty (30) days, following the procedures in Sec. 707.25. In  the event an appeal is denied, a requester may file a statement of  disagreement with OPIC as described in Sec. 707.25(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification of amendment. Within thirty (30) days of the  amendment or correction of a record or the filing of a statement of  disagreement, OPIC will notify all persons, organizations, or agencies  to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that  disclosure was made. If an individual has filed a statement of  disagreement, OPIC will attach a copy of it to the disputed record  whenever the record is disclosed in the future and may also attach a  concise statement of its reasons for denying the request to amend or  correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Records not subject to amendment. The following records are not  subject to amendment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements  made under oath;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or  quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those  proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Presentence records that originated with the courts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records in systems of records that have been exempted from  amendment and correction under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k)  or by notice published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No amendment permitted. No part of these rules shall be  construed to permit:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alteration of evidence presented in the course of judicial,  quasi-judicial, or quasi-legislative proceedings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Collateral attack upon any matter which has been the subject of  judicial or quasi-judicial action; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amendment or correction which would be in violation of an  existing statute, executive order, or regulation.</p>
