Subject to  paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the transitional  applicable rebate percentage is, for a year, the sum of two amounts as  follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For 2012. Two-thirds of the old proportion of 75 percent of the  average per capita savings; and one-third of the   new proportion assigned the plan under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this  section, based on the quality rating specified in Sec. 422.258(d)(7).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For 2013. One-third of the old proportion of 75 percent of the  average per capita savings; and two-thirds of the new proportion  assigned the plan under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, based on  the quality rating at Sec. 422.258(d)(7).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Final applicable rebate percentage. For 2014 and subsequent  years, and subject to paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section,  the final applicable rebate percentage is as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a plan with a quality rating under such system of  at least 4.5 stars, 70 percent of the average per capita savings;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a plan with a quality rating under such system of  at least 3.5 stars and less than 4.5 stars, 65 percent of the average  per capita savings.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a plan with a quality rating under such system of  less than 3.5 stars, 50 percent of the average per capita savings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of low enrollment contracts. For 2012, in the case  of a plan described at Sec. 422.258(d)(7)(iv), the plan must be treated  as having a rating of 4.5 stars for the purpose of determining the  beneficiary rebate amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment of new MA plans. For 2012 or a subsequent year, a new  MA plan defined at Sec. 422.252 that meets the criteria specified by the  Secretary for purposes of Sec. 422.258(d)(7)(v) must be treated as a  qualifying plan under Sec. 422.258(d)(7)(i), except that plan must be  treated as having a rating of 3.5 stars for purposes of determining the  beneficiary rebate amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of rebate. The rebate required under this paragraph must be  provided by crediting the rebate amount to one or more of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em>, which  may include reduction in cost sharing and coverage of drugs not covered  under Part D. The rebate, or portion of rebate, applied toward  supplemental benefits may only be applied to a mandatory supplemental  benefit, and cannot be used to fund an optional supplemental benefit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment of premium for prescription drug coverage. MA  organizations that offer a prescription drug benefit may credit some or  all of the rebate toward reduction of the MA monthly prescription drug  beneficiary premium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Payment toward Part B premium. MA organizations may credit some  or all of the rebate toward reduction of the Medicare Part B premium  (determined without regard to the application of subsections (b), (h),  and (i) of section 1839 of the Act).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure relating to rebates. MA organizations must disclose  to CMS information on the amount of the rebate provided, as required at  Sec. 422.254(d).
