                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator may, by publication of a Final Rule in the  Federal Register, exempt from the application of all or any part of the  Act a chemical mixture consisting of two or more chemical components, at  least one of which is not a List I or List II chemical, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The mixture is formulated in such a way that it cannot be easily  used in the illicit production of a controlled substance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The listed chemical or chemicals contained in the chemical  mixture cannot be readily recovered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any manufacturer seeking an exemption for a chemical mixture,  not exempt under Sec. 1310.12, from the application of all or any part  of the Act, may apply to the Office of Diversion Control, Drug  Enforcement Administration. See the Table of DEA Mailing Addresses in  Sec. 1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An application for exemption under this section shall contain  the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and registration number, if any, of the  applicant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The exact trade name(s) of the applicant's chemical mixture and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the applicant formulates or manufactures the chemical mixture  for other entities, the exact trade names of the chemical mixtures and  the names of the entities for which the chemical mixtures were prepared;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a group of mixtures (e.g. formulations having identical  function and containing the same listed chemical(s)), the information  required in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and a brief narrative of  their use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The complete qualitative and quantitative composition of the  chemical mixture (including all listed and all non-listed chemicals); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a group of mixtures, the concentration range for the listed  chemical and a listing of all non-listed chemicals with respective  concentration ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The chemical and physical properties of the mixture and how  they differ from the properties of the listed chemical or chemicals; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a group of mixtures, how the group's properties differ from  the properties of the listed chemical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement that the applicant believes justifies an exemption  for the chemical mixture or group of mixtures. The statement must  explain how the chemical mixture(s) meets the exemption criteria set  forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A statement that the applicant accepts the right of the  Administrator to terminate exemption from regulation for the chemical  mixture(s) granted exemption under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The identification of any information on the application that is  considered by the applicant to be a trade secret or confidential and  entitled to protection under U.S. laws restricting the public disclosure  of such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator may require the applicant to submit such  additional documents or written statements of fact relevant to the  application that he deems necessary for determining if the application  should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of an  application for an exemption under this section, the Administrator will  notify the applicant in writing of the acceptance or rejection of the  application for filing. If the application is not accepted for filing,  an explanation will be provided. The Administrator is not required to  accept an application if any information required pursuant to paragraph  (c) of this section or requested pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section is lacking or not readily understood. The applicant may,  however, amend the application to meet the requirements of paragraphs  (c) and (d) of this section. If the exemption is subsequently granted,  the applicant shall again be notified in writing and the Administrator  shall issue, and publish in the Federal Register, an order on the  application. This order shall specify the date on which it shall take  effect. The Administrator shall permit any interested person to file  written comments on or objections to the order. If any comments or  objections raise significant issues regarding any findings of fact or  conclusions of law upon which the order is based, the Administrator may  suspend the effectiveness of the order until he has reconsidered the  application in light of the comments and objections filed. Thereafter,  the Administrator shall reinstate, terminate, or amend the original  order as deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator may, at any time, terminate or modify an  exemption for any product pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. In  terminating or modifying an exemption, the Administrator shall issue,  and publish in the Federal Register, notification of the removal of an  exempt product or group of exempt products for which evidence of  diversion has been found. This order shall specify the date on which the  termination of exemption   shall take effect. The Administrator shall permit any interested party  to file written comments on or objections to the order within 60 days of  the date of publication of the order in the Federal Register. If any  such comments or objections raise significant issues regarding any  finding of fact or conclusion of law upon which the order is based, the  Administrator may suspend the effectiveness of the order until he has  reconsidered the order in light of comments and objections filed.  Thereafter, the Administrator shall reinstate, terminate, or amend the  original order as determined appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A manufacturer of an exempted chemical mixture shall notify DEA  in writing, of any change in the quantitative or qualitative composition  of a chemical mixture that has been granted an exemption by application.  Changes include those greater than the range of concentration given in  the application or that remove non-listed chemical(s) given in the  application as part of the formulation. A new application will be  required only if reformulation results in a new product having a  different commercial application or can no longer be defined as part of  a group of exempted chemicals. DEA must be notified of reformulation at  least 30 days in advance of marketing the reformulated mixture. For a  change in name or other designation, code, or any identifier, a written  notification is required. DEA must be notified of any changes at least  60 days in advance of the effective date for the change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each manufacturer seeking exemption must apply for such an  exemption. A formulation granted exemption by publication in the Federal  Register will not be exempted for all manufacturers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The following chemical mixtures, in the form and quantity listed  in the application submitted (indicated as the ``date'') are designated  as exempt chemical mixtures for the purposes set forth in this section  and are exempted by the Administrator from application of Sections 302,  303, 310, 1007, 1008, and 1018 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 822, 823, 830, 957,  958, and 971):</p><p class="depth2">Exempt Chemical Mixtures ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Manufacturer                         Product name \1\                      Form              Date ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cerilliant Corporation..............  1R,2S(-)-Ephedrine hydrochloride 1.0    Liquid...............     8/2/2007</p><p class="depth2">mg/ml as free base in one of: 1,2-</p><p class="depth2">dimethoxyethane, acetonitrile,</p><p class="depth2">acetonitrile: water (=50%</p><p class="depth2">acetonitrile), dimethylformamide,</p><p class="depth2">ethylene glycol, isopropanol,</p><p class="depth2">methanol, methanol/water (50:50),</p><p class="depth2">methanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (80:20),</p><p class="depth2">methylene chloride, or</p><p class="depth2">tetrahydrofuran.
