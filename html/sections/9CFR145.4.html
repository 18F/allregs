A participant advertising products as being of any official  classification may include in his advertising reference to associated or  franchised hatcheries only when such hatcheries produce the same kind of  products of the same classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided by this paragraph, participants in the Plan  may not buy or receive products for any purpose from nonparticipants  unless they are part of an equivalent program, as determined by the  Official State Agency. Participants in the Plan may buy or receive  products from flocks that are neither participants nor part of an  equivalent program, for use in breeding flocks or for experimental  purposes, under the following conditions only:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With the permission of the Official State Agency and the  concurrence of the Service; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By segregation of all birds before introduction into the  breeding flock. Upon reaching sexual maturity, the segregated birds must  be tested and found negative for pullorum-typhoid. The Official State  Agency may require a second test at its discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each participant shall be assigned a permanent approval number  by the Service. This number, prefaced by the numerical code of the  State, will be the official approval number of the participant and may  be used on each certificate, invoice, shipping label, or other document  used by the participant in the sale of his products. Each Official State  Agency which requires an approval or permit number for out-of-State  participants to ship into its State should honor this number. The  approval number shall be withdrawn when the participant no longer  qualifies for participation in the Plan.
