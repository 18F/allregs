                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Participation of parties. Any party shall have the right to appear in a proceeding and may examine and cross-examine witnesses and introduce into the record documentary or other relevant evidence, except that the participation of any intervenor shall be limited to the extent prescribed by the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Person compelled to testify. Any person compelled to testify in a proceeding in response to a subpoena may be accompanied, represented, and advised by an individual meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Representation for parties other than the Department of Justice. Persons who may appear before the Administrative Law Judges on behalf of parties other than the Department of Justice include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An attorney at law who is admitted to practice before the federal courts or before the highest court of any state, the District of Columbia, or any territory or commonwealth of the United States, may practice before the Administrative Law Judges. An attorney's own representation that the attorney is in good standing before any of such courts shall be sufficient proof thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A law student, enrolled in an accredited law school, may practice before an Administrative Law Judge. The law student must seek advance approval by filing a statement with the Administrative Law Judge proving current participation in a legal assistance program or clinic conducted by the law school. Practice before the Administrative Law Judge shall be under direct supervision of a faculty member or an attorney. An appearance by a law student shall be without direct or indirect remuneration. The Administrative Law Judge may determine the amount of supervision required of the supervising faculty member or attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An individual who is neither an attorney nor a law student may be allowed to provide representation to a party upon a written order from the Administrative Law Judge assigned to the case granting approval of the representation. The individual must file a written application with the Administrative Law Judge demonstrating that the individual possesses the knowledge of administrative procedures, technical expertise, or other qualifications necessary to render valuable service in the proceedings and is otherwise competent to advise and assist in the presentation of matters in the proceedings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Application. A written application by an individual who is neither an attorney nor a law student for admission to represent a party in proceedings shall be submitted to the Administrative Law Judge within ten (10) days from the receipt of the Notice of Hearing and complaint by the party on whose behalf the individual wishes to file the application. This period of time for filing the application may be extended upon approval of the Administrative Law Judge. The application shall set forth in detail the requesting individual's qualifications to represent the party.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inquiry on qualifications or ability. The Administrative Law Judge may, at any time, inquire as to the qualifications or ability of any non-attorney to render assistance in proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Denial of authority to appear. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, the Administrative Law Judge may enter an order denying the privilege of appearing to any individual who the Judge finds does not possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; is lacking in character or integrity; has engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct; or has engaged in an act involving moral turpitude.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Exception. Any individual may represent him or herself or any corporation, partnership or unincorporated association of which that individual is a partner or general officer in proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge without prior approval of the Administrative Law Judge and without filing the written application required by this paragraph. Such individuals must, however, file a notice of appearance in the manner set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Representation for the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice may be represented by the appropriate counsel in these proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Proof of authority. Any individual acting in a representative capacity in any adjudicative proceeding may be required by the Administrative Law Judge to show his or her authority to act in such capacity. Representation of a respondent shall be at no expense to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice of appearance. Except for a government attorney filing a complaint pursuant to section 274A, 274B, or 274C of the INA, each attorney shall file a notice of appearance. Such notice shall indicate the name of the case or controversy, the case number if assigned, and the party on whose behalf the appearance is made. The notice of appearance shall be signed by the attorney, and shall be accompanied by a certification indicating that such notice was served on all parties of record. A request for a hearing signed by an attorney and filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service pursuant to section 274A(e)(3)(A) or 274C(d)(2)(A) of the INA, and containing the same information as required by this section, shall be considered a notice of appearance on behalf of the respondent for whom the request was made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Withdrawal or substitution of a representative. Withdrawal or substitution of an attorney or representative may be permitted by the Administrative Law Judge upon written motion. The Administrative Law Judge shall enter an order granting or denying such motion for withdrawal or substitution.
