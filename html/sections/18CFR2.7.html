                            <p class="depth0">The Commission will evaluate the recreational resources of all  projects under Federal license or applications therefor and seek, within  its authority, the ultimate development of these resources, consistent  with the needs of the area to the extent that such development is not  inconsistent with the primary purpose of the project. Reasonable  expenditures by a licensee for public recreational development pursuant  to an approved plan, including the purchase of land, will be included as  part of the project cost. The Commission will not object to licensees  and operators of recreational facilities within the boundaries of a  project charging reasonable fees to users of such facilities in order to  help defray the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining such  facilities. The Commission expects the licensee to assume the following  responsibilities:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To acquire in fee and include within the project boundary enough  land to assure optimum development of the recreational resources  afforded by the project. To the extent consistent with the other  objectives of the license, such lands to be acquired in fee for  recreational purposes shall include the lands adjacent to the exterior  margin of any project reservoir plus all other project lands specified  in any approved recreational use plan for the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To develop suitable public recreational facilities upon project  lands and waters and to make provisions for adequate public access to  such project facilities and waters and to include therein consideration  of the needs of persons with disabilities in the design and construction  of such project facilities and access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To encourage and cooperate with appropriate local, State, and  Federal agencies and other interested entities in the determination of  public recreation needs and to cooperate in the preparation of plans to  meet these needs, including those for sport fishing and hunting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To encourage governmental agencies and private interests, such  as operators of user-fee facilities, to assist in   carrying out plans for recreation, including operation and adequate  maintenance of recreational areas and facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To cooperate with local, State, and Federal Government agencies  in planning, providing, operating, and maintaining facilities for  recreational use of public lands administered by those agencies adjacent  to the project area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To comply with Federal, State and local regulations for  health, sanitation, and public safety, and to cooperate with law  enforcement authorities in the development of additional necessary  regulations for such purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To provide either by itself or through arrangement with others  for facilities to process adequately sewage, litter, and other wastes  from recreation facilities including wastes from watercraft, at  recreation facilities maintained and operated by the licensee or its  concessionaires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To ensure public access and recreational use of project lands  and waters without regard to race, color, sex, religious creed or  national origin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To inform the public of the opportunities for recreation at  licensed projects, as well as of rules governing the accessibility and  use of recreational facilities.
