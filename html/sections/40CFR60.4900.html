                            <p class="depth0">You must meet, as applicable, the performance testing requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the air pollution control device inspections requirements specified in

paragraph (c) of this section, and the bypass stack provisions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance testing requirements. (1) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, as specified in Sec. 60.8(c). Emissions in excess of the emission limits or standards during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction are considered deviations from the applicable emission limits or standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, as specified in Sec. 60.8(c).

Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 must be used simultaneously with each method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All pollutant concentrations must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21MR11.019
Where:
Cadj = Pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen.Cmeas = Pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis.(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen</p><p class="depth3">correction basis).20.9 = Oxygen concentration in air, percent.%O2 = Oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Performance tests must be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in this subpart unless the Administrator does one of the following.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a method with minor changes in methodology.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Approves the use of an equivalent method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Waives the requirement for performance tests because you have demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected SSI unit is in compliance with the standard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph is construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> You must provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, you must notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> You must provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sampling ports adequate for the test methods applicable to the SSI unit, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Safe sampling platform(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Safe access to sampling platform(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each performance test must consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run must be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. Compliance with each emission limit must be determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the three runs. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond your control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> During each test run specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must operate your sewage sludge incinerator at a minimum of 85 percent of your maximum permitted capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Continuous monitor requirements. You must meet the following requirements, as applicable, when using a continuous monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. If you elect to use a continuous emissions monitoring system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.
