Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph  (a) of this section, a linear construction zone may only be authorized  within Colorado Roadless Area upper tier acres if the Regional Forester  determines the LCZ is needed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for  by statute or treaty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an  authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a  pre-existing water court decree (see Sec. 294.43(c)(1)(iv));</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in  paragraph (a) of this section, a linear construction zone may only be  authorized within Colorado Roadless Area non-upper   tier acres if the Regional Forester determines the LCZ is needed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for  by statute or treaty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an  authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a  pre-existing water court decree (see Sec. 294.43(c)(1)(iv));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of existing  or future authorized electrical power lines or telecommunication lines.  Electrical power lines or telecommunication lines within Colorado  Roadless Areas will only be authorized if there is no opportunity for  the project to be implemented outside of a Colorado Roadless Area  without causing substantially greater environmental damage; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a  pipeline associated with operation of an oil and gas lease that allows  surface use within a Colorado Roadless Area or the construction,  reconstruction or maintenance of a pipeline needed to connect to  infrastructure within a Colorado Roadless Area from outside a Colorado  Roadless Area where such a connection would cause substantially less  environmental damage than alternative routes. The construction of  pipelines for the purposes of transporting oil or natural gas through a  Colorado Roadless Area, where the source(s) and destination(s) of the  pipeline are located exclusively outside of a Colorado Roadless Area,  shall not be authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Proposed Linear Construction Zones. If a proposed linear  construction zone meets one of the above exceptions, then the following  must be determined:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Motorized access, without a linear construction zone, is not  feasible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A linear construction zone is consistent with the applicable  land management plan direction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A linear construction zone is no wider than its intended use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery  watershed, a linear construction zone will not diminish, over the long- term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the  occupied native cutthroat trout habitat;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reclamation of a linear construction zone will not diminish,  over the long-term, roadless area characteristics; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all  projects occurring in catchments with occupied native cutthroat trout  habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Linear construction zone decommissioning. Where a linear  construction zone is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area,  installation of the linear facility will be done in a manner that  minimizes ground disturbance, including placement within existing right- of-ways where feasible. All authorizations approving the installation of  linear facilities through the use of a linear construction zone shall  include a responsible official approved reclamation plan for reclaiming  the affected landscape while conserving roadless area characteristics  over the long-term. Upon completion of the installation of a linear  facility via the use of a linear construction zone, all areas of surface  disturbance shall be reclaimed as prescribed in the authorization and  the approved reclamation plan and may not be waived.</p>
