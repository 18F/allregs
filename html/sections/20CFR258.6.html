                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where an examiner has been designated by the Board under this  part to conduct a hearing with respect to a matter before it, the  examiner shall preside at the hearing and shall cause all testimony to  be recorded. The examiner shall, as soon as practicable following the  conclusion of the hearing, mail to each party at the address stated in  his or her appearance a free transcript of the record of the proceedings  had before the examiner. Thereafter, the examiner shall give all parties  participating in the hearing the opportunity to present argument upon  both law and facts. Upon conclusion of the proceedings before him or  her, the examiner shall prepare a report which, together with the record  of the proceedings before him or her, shall be submitted to the Board.  The report shall set forth the examiner's findings   of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations as to decision. The  report may also contain such discussion of the question raised, both  legal and factual, as the examiner may desire to present to the Board. A  copy of the examiner's report shall be served by the examiner upon each  party participating in the hearing by mailing such copy to each such  party at the address stated in his or her appearance. Each party shall,  within 30 days after the date of mailing to him or her of the examiner's  report, file with the Board and serve upon other parties by mailing to  their addresses as stated in their appearances such exceptions in  writing as he or she desires to make to the examiner's findings of fact  and conclusions of law. Each exception shall specifically designate the  particular findings of fact or conclusions of law to which objection is  taken, and shall set forth in detail the grounds for the objection.  General exceptions and exceptions not specifically directed to  particular findings of fact or conclusions of law will not be considered  by the Board. Exceptions to findings of fact shall make specific  reference by page numbers to those portions of the record upon which  reliance is placed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each party shall have 10 days after receipt of exceptions taken  by other parties in which to file with the Board replies to those  exceptions. Replies to exceptions to findings of fact shall make  specific reference by page number to those portions of the record upon  which reliance is placed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Board may, upon the application of a party and for cause  shown, extend the time for filing and serving of exceptions or filing of  replies thereto. The Board will render its decision upon the record, the  examiner's report, and such exceptions and replies thereto as are made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The examiner's report shall be advisory only and the Board may,  in any case, exercise its right to reject or adopt the examiner's report  in whole or in part or adopt such report with modifications. Findings of  fact to which no exceptions are taken will, subject only to the power of  the Board upon its own consideration to reject or modify, be presumed to  be correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The decision of the Board shall be communicated to the parties  participating in the hearing within 30 days of the date upon which the  decision of the Board is entered upon its records.</p>
