                            <p class="depth0">The following examples will illustrate the application of the  foregoing provisions of this subpart to certain programs for which  Federal financial assistance is extended by GSA (in all cases the  discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of race,   color, or national origin, prohibited by title VI of the Act and this  subpart):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the programs involving the transfer of surplus property for  airport, park or recreation, historic monument, wildlife conservation,  or street widening purposes (Sec. 101-6.217(c), (d), (e), and (h)), the  public generally is entitled to the use of the facility and to receive  the services provided by the facility and to facilities operated in  connection therewith, without segregation or any other discriminatory  practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the program involving the loan of machine tools to nonprofit  institutions or training schools (Sec. 101-6.217(o)), discrimination by  the recipient in the admission of students or trainees or in the  treatment of its students or trainees in any aspect of the educational  process is prohibited. In the case of an institution of higher  education, the prohibition applies to the entire institution. In the  case of elementary or secondary schools, the prohibition applies to all  elementary and secondary schools of the recipient school district,  consistent with Sec. 101-6.205-3. In this and other illustrations the  prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or trainees  includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or  trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating,  recreational, or other facilities of the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the programs involving the donation of personal property to  public bodies or the American National Red Cross (Sec. 101-6.217 (f)  and (j)), discrimination in the selection or treatment of individuals to  receive or receiving the benefits or services of the program is  prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the program involving the donation of personal property to  eleemosynary institutions (Sec. 101-6.217(1)), the assurance will apply  to applicants for admission, patients, interns, residents, student  nurses, and other trainees, and to the privilege of physicians,  dentists, and other professionally qualified persons to practice in the  institution, and will apply to the entire institution and to facilities  operated in connection therewith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the programs involving the allotment of space by GSA to  Federal Credit Unions, without charge for rent or services, and the  provision of free space and utilities for vending stands operated by  blind persons (Sec. 101-6.217 (i) and (k)), discrimination by  segregation or otherwise in providing benefits or services is  prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the program involving grants to State and local agencies and  to nonprofit organizations and institutions for the collecting,  describing, preserving, and compiling and publishing of documentary  sources significant to the history of the United States (Sec. 101- 6.217(n)), discrimination by the recipient in the selection of students  or other participants in the program, and, with respect to educational  institutions, in the admission or treatment of students, is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In the program involving the transfer of surplus real property  for use in the provision of rental or cooperative housing to families or  individuals of low or moderate income (Sec. 101-6.217(q)),  discrimination in the selection and assignment of tenants is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring  about indirectly what this subpart forbids it to accomplish directly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> In some situations even though past discriminatory practices  have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to  impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of  the applicant or recipient under Sec. 101-6.209-4 to provide  information as to the availability of the program or activity and the  rights of beneficiaries under this subpart have failed to overcome these  consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient  to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial  and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This  action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for  obtaining referrals or making selections which will ensure that groups  previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Even though an applicant or recipient has never used  discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or  activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some  racial or nationality groups. In   such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special  consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of  its program more widely available to such groups not then being  adequately served. For example, where a university is not adequately  serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may  establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known  and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to  provide that group with more adequate service.
