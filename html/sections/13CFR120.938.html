Upon occurrence of an event of default which does not require automatic  acceleration, SBA may forbear acceleration of the note and attempt to  resolve the default. If the default is not cured subsequently, the note  shall be accelerated. In either case, upon acceleration of the note, the  Debenture which funded it is also due immediately, and SBA must honor  its guarantee of the Debenture. SBA shall not reimburse the investor for  any premium paid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a CDC defaults on a Debenture, SBA generally shall limit its  recovery to the payments made by the small business to the CDC on the  loan made from the Debenture proceeds, and the collateral securing the  defaulted loan. However, SBA will look to the CDC for the entire amount  of the Debenture in the case of fraud, negligence, or misrepresentation  by the CDC.</p>
