                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Additional requirements. In any case or any class of cases arising under these regulations, a GSE may require such additional evidence and a bond of indemnity, with or without surety, as may in the judgment of the GSE be necessary for the protection of the interests of the GSE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of attachment for GSE Securities in Book-entry system. The interest of a debtor in a Security Entitlement may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the Securities Intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, except where a Security Entitlement is maintained in the name of a secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by legal process upon the secured party. These regulations do not purport to establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.</p>
