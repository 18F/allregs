                            <p class="depth0">All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to  provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The  recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well  as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or  eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure  objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive  advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications,  requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests  for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements.  Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is  responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the  recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations  shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror  shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the  recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the  recipient's interest to do so.  (Authority: Pub. L. 104-156; 110 Stat. 1396)</p>
