                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Placement. Any persons subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts l, 2, and 3) must not commingle shipments of nonhuman primates with inanimate cargo or with other animals in animal holding areas of terminal facilities. Nonhuman primates must not be placed near any other animals, including other species of nonhuman primates, and must not be able to touch or see any other animals, including other species of nonhuman primates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cleaning, sanitization, and pest control. All animal holding areas of terminal facilities must be cleaned and sanitized in a manner prescribed in Sec. 3.84(b)(3) of this subpart, as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of debris or excreta and to minimize vermin infestation and disease hazards. Terminal facilities must follow an effective program in all animal holding areas for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and birds and mammals that are pests of nonhuman primates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ventilation. Ventilation must be provided in any animal holding area in a terminal facility containing nonhuman primates by means of windows, doors, vents, or air conditioning. The air must be circulated by fans, blowers, or air conditioning so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation. Auxiliary ventilation, such as exhaust fans, vents, fans, blowers, or air conditioning, must be used in any animal holding area containing nonhuman primates when the ambient temperature is 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) or higher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Temperature. The ambient temperature in an animal holding area containing nonhuman primates must not fall below 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C) or rise above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for more than four consecutive hours at any time nonhuman primates are present. The ambient temperature must be measured in the animal holding area by the carrier, intermediate handler, or a person transporting nonhuman primates who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3), outside any primary enclosure containing a nonhuman primate at a point not more than 3 feet (0.91 m.) away from an outside wall of the primary enclosure, on a level that is even with the enclosure and approximately midway up the side of the enclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Shelter. Any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts l, 2, and 3) holding a nonhuman primate in an animal holding area of a terminal facility must provide the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shelter from sunlight and extreme heat. Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the nonhuman primate from the direct rays of the sun.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shelter from rain or snow. Sufficient protection must be provided to allow nonhuman primates to remain dry during rain, snow, and other precipitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duration. The length of time any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) can

hold a nonhuman primate in an animal holding area of a terminal facility upon arrival is the same as that provided in Sec. 3.86(f) of this subpart.</p>
