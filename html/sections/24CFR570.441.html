For funding under section 106 of the Act, these requirements are applicable to all aspects of the Insular Areas program, including the preparation of the proposed statement and final statements as described in Sec. 570.440. The requirements for citizen participation do not restrict the responsibility or authority of the jurisdiction for the development and execution of its community development program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Citizen participation plan. The insular area jurisdiction must develop and follow a detailed citizen participation plan and must make the plan public. The plan must be completed and available before the AFH and statement for assistance is submitted to HUD, and the jurisdiction must certify that it is following the plan. The plan must set forth the jurisdiction's policies and procedures for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Giving citizens timely notice of local meetings and reasonable and

timely access to local meetings consistent with accessibility and reasonable accommodation requirements in accordance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the regulations at 24 CFR part 8, and the Americans with Disabilities Act and the regulations at 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, as applicable, as well as information and records relating to the grantee's proposed and actual use of CDBG funds including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of CDBG funds expected to be made available for the coming year, including the grant and anticipated program income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The range of activities that may be undertaken with those funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The estimated amount of those funds proposed to be used for activities that will benefit low- and moderate-income persons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The proposed CDBG activities likely to result in displacement and the jurisdiction's plans, consistent with the policies developed under Sec. 570.606(b), for minimizing displacement of persons as a result of its proposed activities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The types and levels of assistance the jurisdiction plans to make available (or to require others to make available) to persons displaced by CDBG-funded activities, even if the jurisdiction expects no displacement to occur;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Providing technical assistance to groups that are representative of persons of low- and moderate-income that request assistance in commenting on the AFH and developing proposals. The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the jurisdiction.

There must be reasonable notice of the hearings, and the hearings must be held at times and accessible locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with reasonable accommodations, including materials in accessible formats, for persons with disabilities. The jurisdiction must specify in its citizen participation plan how it will meet the requirement for hearings at times and accessible locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Assessing its language needs, identifying any need for translation of notices and other vital documents and, in the case of public hearings, meeting the needs of non-English speaking residents where a significant number of non-English speaking residents can reasonably be expected to participate.

The jurisdiction's policies and procedures must provide for timely written answers to written complaints and grievances within 15 working days after the receipt of the complaint, where practicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Encouraging citizen participation, particularly by low- and moderate-income persons who reside in areas in which CDBG funds are proposed to be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Publication of proposed AFH and proposed statement.
