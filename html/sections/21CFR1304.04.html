                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, every inventory and other records required to be kept under this part must be kept by the registrant and be available, for at least 2 years from the date of such inventory or records, for inspection and copying by authorized employees of the Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial and shipping records (such as invoices and packing slips but not executed order forms subject to Sec. Sec. 1305.17 and 1305.27 of this chapter) may be kept at a central location, rather than at the registered location, if the registrant has notified the Administration of his intention to keep central records. Written notification must be submitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, in triplicate, to the Special Agent in Charge of the Administration in the area in which the registrant is located. Unless the registrant is informed by the Special Agent in Charge that permission to keep central records is denied, the registrant may maintain central records commencing 14 days after receipt of his notification by the Special Agent in Charge. All notifications must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nature of the records to be kept centrally.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The exact location where the records will be kept.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name, address, DEA registration number and type of DEA registration of the registrant whose records are being maintained centrally.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether central records will be maintained in a manual, or computer readable, form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A registered retail pharmacy that possesses additional registrations for automated dispensing systems at long term care facilities may keep all records required by this part for those additional registered sites at the retail pharmacy or other approved central location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A collector that is authorized to maintain a collection receptacle at a long-term care facility shall keep all records required by this part relating to those collection receptacles at the registered location, or other approved central location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All registrants that are authorized to maintain a central recordkeeping system under paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The records to be maintained at the central record location shall not include executed order forms and inventories, which shall be maintained at each registered location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the records are kept on microfilm, computer media or in any form requiring special equipment to render the records easily readable, the registrant shall provide access to such equipment with the records. If any code system is used (other than pricing information), a key to the code shall be provided to make the records understandable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The registrant agrees to deliver all or any part of such records to the registered location within two business days upon receipt of a written request from the Administration for such records, and if the Administration chooses to do so in lieu of requiring delivery of such records to the registered location, to allow authorized employees of the Administration to inspect such records at the central location upon request by such employees without a warrant of any kind.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event that a registrant fails to comply with these conditions, the Special Agent in Charge may cancel such central recordkeeping authorization, and all other central recordkeeping authorizations held by the registrant without a hearing or other procedures. In the event of a cancellation of central recordkeeping authorizations under this paragraph the registrant shall, within the time specified by the Special Agent in Charge, comply with the requirements of this section that all records be kept at the registered location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Registrants need not notify the Special Agent in Charge or obtain central recordkeeping approval in order to maintain records on an in-house computer system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ARCOS participants who desire authorization to report from other than their registered locations must obtain a separate central reporting identifier. Request for central reporting identifiers will be submitted to the ARCOS Unit. See the Table of DEA Mailing Addresses in Sec. 1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All central recordkeeping permits previously issued by the Administration expired September 30, 1980.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each registered manufacturer, distributor, importer, exporter, narcotic treatment program and compounder for narcotic treatment program shall maintain inventories and records of controlled substances as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in Schedules I and II shall be maintained separately from all of the records of the registrant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inventories and records of controlled substances listed in Schedules III, IV, and V shall be maintained either separately from all other records of the registrant or in such form that the information required is readily retrievable from the ordinary business records of the registrant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each registered individual practitioner required to keep records and institutional practitioner shall maintain inventories and records of controlled substances in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each registered pharmacy shall maintain the inventories and records of controlled substances as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inventories and records of all controlled substances listed in Schedule I and II shall be maintained separately from all other records of the pharmacy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Paper prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances shall be maintained at the registered location in a separate prescription file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inventories and records of Schedules III, IV, and V controlled substances shall be maintained either separately from all other records of the pharmacy or in such form that the information required is readily retrievable from ordinary business records of the pharmacy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Paper prescriptions for Schedules III, IV, and V controlled substances shall be maintained at the registered location either in a separate prescription file for Schedules III, IV, and V controlled substances only or in such form that they are readily retrievable from the other prescription records of the pharmacy. Prescriptions will be deemed readily retrievable if, at the time they are initially filed, the face of the prescription is stamped in red ink in the lower right corner with the letter ``C'' no less than 1 inch high and filed either in the prescription file for controlled substances listed in Schedules I and II or in the usual consecutively numbered prescription file for noncontrolled substances. However, if a pharmacy employs a computer application for prescriptions that permits identification by prescription number and retrieval of original documents by prescriber name, patient's name, drug dispensed, and date filled, then the requirement to mark the hard copy prescription with a red ``C'' is waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Records of electronic prescriptions for controlled substances shall be maintained in an application that meets the requirements of part 1311 of this chapter. The computers on which the records are maintained may be located at another location, but the records must be readily retrievable at the registered location if requested by the Administration or other law enforcement agent. The electronic application must be capable of printing out or transferring the records in a format that is readily understandable to an Administration or other law enforcement agent at the registered location. Electronic copies of prescription records must be sortable by prescriber name, patient name, drug dispensed, and date filled.
