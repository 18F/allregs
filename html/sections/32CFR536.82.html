                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Original approval or settlement authority (including TAJAG,  TJAG, Secretary of the Army, or the Secretary's designees). </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An  original settlement authority may reconsider the denial of, or final  offer on, a claim brought under the MCA upon request of the claimant or  the claimant's authorized agent. In the absence of such a request, the  settlement authority may on his or her initiative reconsider a claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and  correct action on an MCA claim previously settled in whole or in part  (even if a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears that  the original action was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence  of record at the time of the action or subsequently received. For errors  in fact, the new evidence must not have been discoverable at the time of  final action by either the Army or the claimant through the exercise of  reasonable diligence. Corrective action may also be taken when an error  contrary to the parties' mutual understanding is discovered in the  original action. If the settlement or approval authority determines that  their original action was incorrect, they will modify the action and, if  appropriate, make a supplemental payment. The basis for a   change in action will be stated in a memorandum included in the file.  For example, a claim was settled for $15,000, but the settlement  agreement was typed to read ``$1,500'' and the error is not discovered  until the file is being prepared for payment. If appropriate, a  corrected payment will be made. A settlement authority who has reason to  believe that a settlement was obtained by fraud on the part of the  claimant or claimant's legal representative, will reopen action on that  claim and, if the belief is substantiated, correct the action. The basis  for correcting an action will be stated in a memorandum and included in  the file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A successor approval or settlement authority (including TAJAG,  TJAG, Secretary of the Army, or the Secretary's designees)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Reconsideration. A successor approval or settlement authority may  reconsider the denial of, or final offer on, an MCA claim upon request  of the claimant or the claimant's authorized agent only on the basis of  fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake  (misinterpretation) of law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Settlement correction. A successor approval or settlement  authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's action on a claim that  was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons that an  original authority may do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time requirement for filing request for reconsideration.  Requests postmarked more than five years from the date of mailing of  final notice will be denied based on the doctrine of laches.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Finality of action. Action by the appropriate authority (either  affirming the prior action or granting full or granting full or partial  relief) is final under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2735. Action upon a  request for reconsideration constitutes final administrative disposition  of a claim. No further requests for reconsideration will be allowed  except on the basis of fraud.</p>
