No later than 90 days after the due date established by the OPTN, a transplant center must submit to the OPTN at least 95 percent of the required data submissions on all transplants (deceased and living donors) performed during the prior 3 years. Required data submissions include, but are not limited to, submission of the appropriate OPTN forms for transplant candidate registration, transplant recipient registration and follow-up, and living donor registration and follow-up.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard: Clinical experience. To be considered for re-approval, an organ-specific transplant center must generally perform an average of 10 transplants per year during the prior 3 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standard: Outcome requirements. CMS will review outcomes for all transplants performed at a center, including outcomes for living donor transplants, if applicable. CMS will review adult and pediatric outcomes separately when a center requests Medicare approval to perform both adult and pediatric transplants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS will compare each transplant center's observed number of patient deaths and graft failures 1-year post-transplant to the center's expected number of patient deaths and graft failures 1-year post-transplant using data contained in the most recent SRTR center-specific report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS will not consider a center's patient and graft survival rates to be acceptable if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A center's observed patient survival rate or observed graft survival rate is lower than its expected patient survival rate and graft survival rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All three of the following thresholds are crossed over:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The one-sided p-value is less than 0.05,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The number of observed events (patient deaths or graft failures) minus the number of expected events is greater than 3, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The number of observed events divided by the number of expected events is greater than 1.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions.

with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the outcome requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for heart-lung transplants performed at the center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A heart-lung transplant center is not required to comply

with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the outcome requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for heart-lung transplants performed at the center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An intestine transplant center is not required to comply with the outcome requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for intestine, combined liver-intestine, and multivisceral transplants performed at the center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A pancreas transplant center is not required to comply with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the outcome requirements in paragraph (c) of this section for pancreas transplants performed at the center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A center that is approved to perform pediatric transplants is not required to comply with the clinical experience requirements in paragraph (b) of this section to be re-approved.
