Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Quality. (1) The standard of quality for canned pears is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of quality for canned pears is as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maturity. All units tested in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are pierced by a weight of not more than 300 grams (10.6 ounces).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Minimum size. In the case of halves and quarters styles, the weight of each unit is not less than 17 grams (0.6 ounce) and 8.5 grams (0.3 ounce), respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Uniformity of size--(a) Whole, halves, and quarters. In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, among those units comprising 95 percent by count of those present in the container that are most uniform in size, the weight of the largest unit is not more than twice the weight of the smallest unit. In containers with fewer than 20 units, 1 unit may be disregarded in making the determination. Where a unit has broken in the container, reassemble the broken pieces to approximate a single unit of the appropriate style.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Chunky. In the case of chunky style, not more than 25 percent of the drained weight of the contents of the container consists of units that will pass through an opening 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) wide or that are more than 44 millimeters (1.75 inches) along the longest cut edge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Peel (except unpeeled style). Not more than 10 square centimeters (1.6 square inches) of peel adhering to pears or loose in the container per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Blemished units. Not more than 20 percent by count of the units in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormality aggregating the area of a circle more than 6.5 millimeters (0.25 inch) in diameter; corky or hard spots on outer surfaces aggregating the area of a circle more than 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) in diameter; or dark brown areas aggregating the area of a circle less than 6.5 millimeters (0.25 inch) in diameter which penetrate into the flesh or affect the appearance of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Trimmed units. In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, all units are untrimmed or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape of the unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Crushed or broken units. In the case of whole, halves, quarter, slices, dice, and chunky styles, not more than 10 percent by count of the units in containers of 10 or more units and not

more than 1 unit in containers of less than 10 units are crushed or broken. A unit that lost its normal shape because of ripeness and bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered to be crushed or broken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Loose core material in all styles except uncored whole style. Not more than two units of loose core material per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight. A unit of such material is defined as a portion of loose core, with or without seeds, aggregating approximately one-half of a pear core.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Partially cored units in all styles except uncored whole style. Not more than 40 percent by count partially cored units in halves, quarters, slices, and pieces or irregular pieces styles and not more than 5 percent by weight in dice style. A partially cored unit is a unit of pear that contains an attached portion of the seed cell cavity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Seeds in all styles except whole uncored style. Not more than 8 seeds or the equivalent in pieces of seeds per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight. Seeds included as cored material in paragraph (b)(1) (viii) and (ix) of this section shall not be counted a second time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Canned pears shall be tested by the following method to determine whether they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 28.6 millimeters (1.12 inches) inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 19 millimeters (0.75 inch) by 25.4 millimeters (1 inch) inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 19 millimeters (0.75 inch). Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with rectangular peel surface at least 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) by 25.4 millimeters (1 inch) cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 4 millimeters (0.16 inch) in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by the support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams (3.5 ounces). Set the receptacle so that the surface of the test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams (0.42 ounce) per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determine compliance as specified in Sec. 145.3(o) except that a lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for peel in all styles except unpeeled styles and seeds in all styles except whole uncored style based on the average of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans set out in Sec. 145.3(p).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the quality of canned pears falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in Sec. 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned pears falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (x) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality (``Good Food--Not High Grade'') a new line, as specified after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which the canned pears fail to meet, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``Not tender'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Small halves'' or ``small quarters'', as the case may be;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(a)</em> ``Mixed sizes'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> ``Undersized and/or oversized pieces'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Excessive peel'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> ``Blemished'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> ``Unevenly trimmed'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> ``Partly crushed or broken'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> ``Excessive core'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> ``Excessive core'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> ``Excessive seeds''.

Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name ``pears'' and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fill of container. (1) The standard of fill of container for canned pears is the maximum quantity of the optional pear ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The standard of fill of container for canned pears is the maximum quantity of the optional pear ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If canned pears fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in Sec. 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.
