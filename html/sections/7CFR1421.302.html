                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be an eligible producer for a payment under this subpart, the  person must be a producer of wheat, barley, oats, or triticale in the  2008 through 2012 crop years. Also, to be an eligible producer, the  person must meet all other qualifications for payment that are set out  in this subpart, set out in parts 12, 718, 1400, and 1405 of this title.  A person will not be considered the producer of the crop unless that  person was responsible for the planting of the crop and had control and  title of the crop at all times, including, at the time of planting and  the time of the request for a payment under, this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A minor may participate in the program if the right of majority  has been conferred on the minor by court order or by statute, or if the  minor participates through a guardian authorized to act on the minor's  behalf in these matters. Alternatively, a minor may participate if the  program documents are all signed by an acceptable (to CCC) guarantor or  if bond, acceptable to CCC, is provided by a surety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the crop to be eligible, the crop, in addition to other  standards that may apply, must be grown on land that is classified as  ``cropland'' in FSA   farm records or on land that FSA determines has been cropped in the last  3 years except that the land may also qualify if the land is committed  to a crop rotation, normal for the locality, that includes harvesting  the subject crop for grain. These rules are designed to assure, to the  extent practicable, the available payment did not produce plantings that  otherwise would not have occurred and the CCC may deny payments in any  instance in which there is reason to believe that the planting was done  for that purpose. To that end, if the commodity involved has not been  previously grown by the producer or is not one which is not  predominately produced locally, the producer must submit evidence of  seed purchases for planting the commodities and other evidence deemed  needed or appropriate by the COC in order to assure that the program  goals are made and that the land was not planted to an eligible  commodity simply to obtain a payment. Also, the land to be eligible  must, for the year involved, be grazed and cannot, during the crop year,  be harvested at any time for any purpose, except as determined by the  Deputy Administrator to accommodate producers with a history of double- cropping when the crop to be harvested is not the crop for which a  payment is to be made under this subpart. Land will be considered grazed  only to the extent that the crop on the land is consumed in the field as  live plants by livestock for the normal period of time for grazing in  the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A producer must, at the time of the agreement made under this  part to obtain a payment, meet all other eligible criteria for obtaining  loan deficiency payments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For producers of triticale who obtain a payment under this  subpart the producer must enter into an agreement with CCC to forgo any  harvesting of triticale on the acreage for which such a payment is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No payment will be made if the crop could not have been  harvested because of weather conditions or any other reason.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The producer must retain the control and title of the commodity  for which the payment is sought from the date of planting through the  date on which mechanical harvesting of the crop would normally occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Producers who elect to graze 2008 through 2012 crop wheat,  barley, oats, or triticale will not be eligible for an indemnity under  the Federal Crop Insurance Program provision of Chapter IV of this title  or a payment under Noninsured Crop Assistance Program authorized under  part 1437 of this chapter.
