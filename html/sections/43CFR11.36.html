[Sections 11.14(v) and 11.62 define ``injury.'' Section 11.83(c)(1) defines ``compensable value.'']</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The type A procedures address the following categories of injury and compensable value:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct mortality of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from short-term exposure to the released substance. Volume IV of the NRDAM/CME technical document (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 11.18) lists the species that the NRDAM/CME covers. Section 3, Volume III of the NRDAM/GLE technical document (incorporated by reference,

see Sec. 11.18) lists the species that the NRDAM/GLE covers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct loss of production of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from short-term exposure to the released substance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indirect mortality of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from disruption of the food web by direct mortality or direct loss of production;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indirect loss of production of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from disruption of the food web by direct mortality or direct loss of production;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Lost assimilative capacity of water column and sediments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Lost economic rent for lost commercial harvests resulting from any closures specified by the authorized official and/or from population losses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Lost recreational harvests resulting from any closures specified by the authorized official and/or from population losses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments, lost wildlife viewing, resulting from population losses, by residents of the States bordering the provinces in which the population losses occurred. [A province is one of the geographic areas delineated in Table 6.1, Volume I of the NRDAM/CME technical document.] For the type A procedure for Great Lakes environments, lost wildlife viewing, resulting from population losses, by residents of local areas bordering the provinces in which the population losses occurred. [A province is one of the geographic areas delineated in Table 8.1, Volume I of the NRDAM/GLE technical document.];</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Lost beach visitation due to closure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> For the type A procedure for Great Lakes environments, lost boating due to closure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the authorized official uses both type A and type B procedures, he or she must explain in the Assessment Plan how he or she intends to prevent double recovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the authorized official uses type B procedures for injuries not addressed in a type A procedure, he or she must follow all of subpart E (which contains standards for determining and quantifying injury as well as determining damages), Sec. 11.31(c) (which addresses content of the Assessment Plan), and Sec. 11.37 (which addresses confirmation of exposure). When the authorized official uses type B procedures for compensable values that are not included in a type A procedure but that result from injuries that are addressed in the type A procedure, he or she need not follow all of subpart E, Sec. 11.31(c), and Sec. 11.37. Instead, the authorized official may rely on the injury predictions of the type A procedure and simply use the valuation methodologies authorized by Sec. 11.83(c) to calculate compensable value. When using valuation methodologies, the authorized official must comply with Sec. 11.84.
