                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Major planning and decisions points. The NEPA process will be  fully coordinated with APHIS planning in cooperation with program  personnel. Specific decision points or milestones will be identified and  communicated to the public and others in a notice of intent and in the  context of the public scoping process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public involvement. There will be an early and open process for  determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the environmental  impact statement process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement  will be published in the Federal Register as soon as it is determined  that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect  significantly the quality of the human environment. The notice may  include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other  involvement in APHIS' environmental impact statement process, including  the scoping process, commenting on draft documents, and participation in  the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to CEQ's  implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Opportunities for public involvement in the environmental  assessment process will be announced in the same fashion as the  availability of environmental assessments and findings of no significant  impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notification of the availability of environmental assessments  and findings of no significant impact for proposed activities will be  published in the Federal Register, unless it is determined that the  effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern. Where  the effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern,  notice will normally be provided through publication in a local or area  newspaper of general circulation and/or the procedures implementing  Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All environmental documents, comments received, and any  underlying documents, including interagency correspondence where such  correspondence transmits comments of Federal agencies on the  environmental impact of proposals for which documents were prepared  (except for privileged or confidential information (50 FR 38561)), will  be made available to the public upon request. Materials to be made  available will be provided without charge, to the extent practicable, or  at a fee not more than the actual cost of reproducing copies required to  be sent to other Federal agencies, including CEQ.</p>
