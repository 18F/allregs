                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 1.809- 5. The amount thus obtained is the gain or loss from operations for the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of share of investment yield set aside for  policyholders. Section 809(a)(1) provides that the share of each and  every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially  tax-exempt interest, and dividends received) of any life insurance  company set aside for policyholders shall not be included in gain or  loss from operations. For this purpose, the percentage used in  determining the share of each of these items comprising the investment  yield set aside for policyholders shall be determined by dividing the  required interest (as defined in section 809(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of  this section) by the investment yield (as defined in section 804(c) and  paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.804-4). The percentage thus obtained is then  applied to each and every item of the investment yield so that the share  of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders  shall be excluded from gain or loss from operations. However, if in any  case the required interest exceeds the investment yield, then the share  of any item set aside for policyholders shall be 100 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and  paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.809-4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required interest defined. (1) For purposes of part I, section  809(a)(2) defines the term required interest for any taxable year as the  sum of the products obtained by multiplying (i) each rate of interest  required, or assumed by the taxpayer, in calculating the reserves  described in section 810(c), by (ii) the means of the amount of such  reserves computed at that rate at the beginning and end of the taxable  year. In the case of the reserves described in section 810(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, such  rate of interest shall be the same as that used by the taxpayer for  purposes of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.801-5 (relating to the definition  of reserves required by law) with respect to such reserves. In the case  of the reserves described in section 810(c)(2) through (5), such rate of  interest shall be the same as that actually paid, credited, or accrued  by the taxpayer with respect to such reserves. Thus, the required  interest for any taxable year includes the elements of interest paid (as  defined in section 805(e)) with respect to the reserves described in  section 810(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the amount of life  insurance reserves taken into account shall be adjusted first as  required by section 818(c) (relating to an election with respect to life  insurance reserves computed on a preliminary term basis) and then as  required by section 806(a) (relating to adjustments for certain changes  in reserves and assets) before applying the rate of interest required,  or assumed by the taxpayer, thereto. However, in the case of the  adjustments required by section 810(d) as a result of a change in the  basis of computing reserves, the adjustments to any of the reserves  described in section 810(c) shall be taken into account in accordance  with the rules prescribed in section 810(d) and Sec. 1.810-3.
