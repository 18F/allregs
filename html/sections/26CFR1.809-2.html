                                Sec. 1.809-2  Exclusion of share of investment yield set aside for
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 809 provides the rules for determining the gain or loss from operations of a life insurance company, which amount is necessary to determine life insurance company taxable income. In order to determine gain or loss from operations, a life insurance company must first determine the share of each and every item of its investment yield (as defined in section 804(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.804-4) set aside for policyholders (as computed under section 809(a)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section), as this share is excluded from gain or loss from operations (as defined in section 809(b) (1) and (2) and paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 1.809-3, respectively). The life insurance company shall then add its share of each and every item of its investment yield to the sum of the items comprising gross amount (as described in section 809(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.809-4). In addition, the life insurance company shall, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, add the amount (if any) by which its net long-term capital gain exceeds its net short-term loss. From the sum so computed (which includes the capital gains item only for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961) there shall then be subtracted the deductions provided in section 809(d) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.809-5. The amount thus obtained is the gain or loss from operations for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of share of investment yield set aside for policyholders. Section 809(a)(1) provides that the share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received) of any life insurance company set aside for policyholders shall not be included in gain or loss from operations. For this purpose, the percentage used in determining the share of each of these items comprising the investment yield set aside for policyholders shall be determined by dividing the required interest (as defined in section 809(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of this section) by the investment yield (as defined in section 804(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.804-4). The percentage thus obtained is then applied to each and every item of the investment yield so that the share of each and every item of investment yield set aside for policyholders shall be excluded from gain or loss from operations. However, if in any case the required interest exceeds the investment yield, then the share of any item set aside for policyholders shall be 100 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Computation of life insurance company's share of investment yield. For purposes of subpart C, part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, section 809(b)(3) provides that the percentage used in determining the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received) shall be obtained by subtracting the percentage obtained under paragraph (b) of this section from 100 percent. For example, if the policyholders' percentage (as determined under section 809(a)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section) is 72.38 percent, then the life insurance company's share is 27.62 percent (100 percent minus 72.38 percent). In such a case, if the amount of a particular item is $200, then the life insurance company's share of such item included in determining gain or loss from operations is $55.24 ($200 multiplied by 27.62 percent) and the share of such item set aside for policyholders

(which is excluded from gain or loss from operations) is $144.76 ($200 multiplied by 72.38 percent). For purposes of determining gain or loss from operations, the life insurance company's share of each and every item of investment yield (including tax-exempt interest, partially tax-exempt interest, and dividends received) shall be added to the sum of the items comprising gross amount (as described in section 809(c) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.809-4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required interest defined. (1) For purposes of part I, section 809(a)(2) defines the term required interest for any taxable year as the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (i) each rate of interest required, or assumed by the taxpayer, in calculating the reserves described in section 810(c), by (ii) the means of the amount of such reserves computed at that rate at the beginning and end of the taxable year. In the case of the reserves described in section 810(c)(1), such rate of interest shall be the same as that used by the taxpayer for purposes of paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.801-5 (relating to the definition of reserves required by law) with respect to such reserves. In the case of the reserves described in section 810(c)(2) through (5), such rate of interest shall be the same as that actually paid, credited, or accrued by the taxpayer with respect to such reserves. Thus, the required interest for any taxable year includes the elements of interest paid (as defined in section 805(e)) with respect to the reserves described in section 810(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of part I, section 809(a)(2) defines the term required interest for any taxable year as the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (i) each rate of interest required, or assumed by the taxpayer, in calculating the reserves described in section 810(c), by (ii) the means of the amount of such reserves computed at that rate at the beginning and end of the taxable year.

However, in the case of the adjustments required by section 810(d) as a result of a change in the basis of computing reserves, the adjustments to any of the reserves described in section 810(c) shall be taken into account in accordance with the rules prescribed in section 810(d) and Sec. 1.810-3.
