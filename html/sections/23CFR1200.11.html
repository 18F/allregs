                            <p class="depth0">Each fiscal year, the State's Highway Safety Plan shall consist of the following components:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Highway safety planning process. (1) A brief description of the data sources and processes used by the State to identify its highway safety problems, describe its highway safety performance measures and define its performance targets, develop and select evidence-based countermeasure strategies and projects to address its problems and achieve its performance targets. In describing these data sources and processes, the State shall identify the participants in the processes (e.g., highway safety committees, program stakeholders, community and constituent groups), discuss the strategies for project selection (e.g., constituent outreach, public meetings, solicitation of proposals), and list the information and data sources consulted (e.g., Countermeasures That Work, Sixth Edition, 2011).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A brief description of the data sources and processes used by the State to identify its highway safety problems, describe its highway safety performance measures and define its performance targets, develop and select evidence-based countermeasure strategies and projects to address its problems and achieve its performance targets. In describing these data sources and processes, the State shall identify the participants in the processes (e.g., highway safety committees, program stakeholders, community and constituent groups), discuss the strategies for project selection (e.g., constituent outreach, public meetings, solicitation of proposals), and list the information and data sources consulted (e.g., Countermeasures That Work, Sixth Edition, 2011).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the efforts to coordinate and the outcomes from the coordination of the highway safety plan, data collection, and information systems with the State strategic highway safety plan (as defined in 23 U.S.C. 148(a)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Performance plan. A performance plan containing the following elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of annual quantifiable and measurable highway safety performance targets that is data-driven, consistent with the Uniform Guidelines for Highway Safety Program and based on highway safety problems identified by the State during the planning process conducted under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance measures developed by DOT in collaboration with the Governor's Highway Safety Association and others, beginning with the MAP-21 directed ``Traffic Safety Performance Measures for States and Federal Agencies'' (DOT HS 811 025), which are used as a minimum in developing the performance targets identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Beginning with grants awarded after fiscal year 2014, the performance measures common to the State's HSP and the State highway safety improvement program (fatalities, fatality rate, and serious injuries) shall be defined identically, as coordinated through the State strategic highway safety plan. At least one performance measure and performance target that is data driven shall be provided for each program area that enables the State to track progress, from a specific baseline, toward meeting the target (e.g., a target to ``increase seat belt use from X percent in Year 1 to Y percent in Year 2,'' using a performance measure of ``percent of restrained occupants in front outboard seating positions in passenger motor vehicles''). For each performance measure, the State shall provide:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documentation of current safety levels;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quantifiable annual performance targets; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Justification for each performance target that explains why the target is appropriate and data-driven.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional performance measures, not included under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For program areas where performance measures have not been jointly developed, a State shall develop its own performance measures and performance targets that are data-driven (e.g., distracted driving, bicycles). The State shall provide the same information as required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Highway safety strategies and projects. A description of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each countermeasure strategy and project the State plans to implement to reach the performance targets identified in paragraph (b) of this section. At a minimum, the State shall describe one year of Section 402 and 405 countermeasure strategies and projects (which should include countermeasure strategies identified in the State strategic highway safety plan) and shall identify funds from other sources, including Federal, State, local, and private sector funds, that the State plans to use for such projects or use to achieve program area performance targets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State's process for selecting the countermeasure strategies and projects described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to allow the State to meet the highway safety performance targets described in paragraph (b) of this

section. At a minimum, the State shall provide an assessment of the overall traffic safety impacts of the strategies chosen and proposed or approved projects to be funded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The data and data analysis or other documentation supporting the effectiveness of proposed countermeasure strategies described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (e.g., the State may include information on the cost effectiveness of proposed countermeasure strategies, if such information is available).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The evidence-based traffic safety enforcement program to prevent traffic violations, crashes, and crash fatalities and injuries in areas most at risk for such incidents. At a minimum, the State shall provide for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An analysis of crashes, crash fatalities, and injuries in areas of highest risk;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deployment of resources based on that analysis; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Continuous follow-up and adjustment of the enforcement plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The planned high visibility enforcement strategies to support national mobilizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Performance report. A program-area-level report on the State's success in meeting State performance targets from the previous fiscal year's Highway Safety Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Program cost summary and list of projects. (1) HS Form 217, meeting the requirements of Appendix B, completed to reflect the State's proposed allocations of funds (including carry-forward funds) by program area. The funding level used shall be an estimate of available funding for the upcoming fiscal year based on amounts authorized for the fiscal year and projected carry-forward funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HS Form 217, meeting the requirements of Appendix B, completed to reflect the State's proposed allocations of funds (including carry-forward funds) by program area. The funding level used shall be an estimate of available funding for the upcoming fiscal year based on amounts authorized for the fiscal year and projected carry-forward funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each program area, an accompanying list of projects that the State proposes to conduct for that fiscal year and an estimated amount of Federal funds for each such project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Certifications and assurances. Appendix A--Certifications and Assurances for Section 402 Grants, signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety, certifying the HSP application contents and providing assurances that the State will comply with applicable laws and regulations, financial and programmatic requirements, and, in accordance with Sec. 1200.13 of this part, the special funding conditions for the Section 402 program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Teen Traffic Safety Program. If the State elects to include the Teen Traffic Safety Program authorized under 23 U.S.C. 402(m), a description of projects that the State will conduct as part of the Teen Traffic Safety Program--a statewide program to improve traffic safety for teen drivers--and the assurances in Appendix C, signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Section 405 grant application. Application for any of the national priority safety program grants, in accordance with the requirements of subpart C, including Appendix D--Certifications and Assurances for Section 405 Grants, signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety.</p>
