                                Sec.  250.448  What are the BOP pressure tests requirements?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low- pressure and a high-pressure test for each BOP component. You must  conduct the low-pressure test before the high-pressure test. Each  individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate  that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. Required test  pressures are as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Low-pressure test. All low-pressure tests must be between 200  and 300 psi. Any initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a  pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the  initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and  reinitiate the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> High-pressure test for ram-type BOPs, the choke manifold, and  other BOP components. The high-pressure test must equal the rated  working pressure of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your  calculated maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP) for the  applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the  MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test  pressures in your APD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> High pressure test for annular-type BOPs. The high pressure test  must equal 70 percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment or  to a pressure approved in your APD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required  pressure for 5   minutes. However, for surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a  subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if you record  your test pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour chart, on a 1-hour  chart, or on a digital recorder. If the equipment does not hold the  required pressure during a test, you must correct the problem and retest  the affected component(s).</p>
