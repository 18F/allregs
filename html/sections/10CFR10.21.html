In making this recommendation the Director, Division of Facilities and Security, shall consider factors such as the seriousness of the derogatory information developed, the degree of access of the individual to classified information, and the individual's opportunity by reason of his or her position to commit acts adversely affecting the national security. An individual's access authorization and/or employment clearance may not be suspended except by the direction of the Executive Director for Operations, Deputy Executive Director for Corporate Management and Chief Information Officer or other Deputy Executive Director.
