                                Sec.  1.366  Submission of maintenance fees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The patentee may pay maintenance fees and any necessary  surcharges, or any person or organization may pay maintenance fees and  any necessary surcharges on behalf of a patentee. A maintenance fee  transmittal letter may be signed by a juristic applicant or patent  owner. A patentee need not file authorization to enable any person or  organization to pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on  behalf of the patentee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge submitted for a  patent must be submitted in the amount due on the date the maintenance  fee and any necessary surcharge are paid. A maintenance fee or surcharge  may be paid in the manner set forth in Sec.  1.23 or by an authorization  to charge a deposit account established pursuant to Sec.  1.25. Payment  of a maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge or the authorization to  charge a deposit account must be submitted within the periods set forth  in Sec.  1.362 (d), (e), or (f). Any payment or authorization of  maintenance fees and surcharges filed at any other time will not be  accepted and will not serve as a payment of the maintenance fee except  insofar as a delayed payment of the maintenance fee is accepted by the  Director in an expired patent pursuant to a petition filed under Sec.   1.378. Any authorization to charge a deposit account must authorize the  immediate charging of the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge to  the deposit account. Payment of less than the required amount, payment  in a manner other than that set forth in Sec.  1.23, or in the filing of  an authorization to charge a deposit account having insufficient funds  will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee or surcharge on a  patent. The procedures set forth in Sec.  1.8 or Sec.  1.10 may be  utilized in paying maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In submitting maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges,  identification of the patents for which maintenance fees are being paid  must include the patent number, and the application number of the United  States application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being  paid. If the payment includes identification of only the patent number  (i.e., does not identify the application number of the United States  application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid),  the Office may apply the payment to the patent identified by patent  number in the payment or may return the payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of maintenance fees and any surcharges should identify  the fee being paid for each patent as to whether it is the 3\1/2\-, 7\1/ 2\-, or 11\1/2\-year fee, whether small entity status is being changed  or claimed, the amount of the maintenance fee and any surcharge being  paid, and any assigned customer number. If the maintenance fee and any  necessary surcharge is being paid on a reissue patent, the payment must  identify the reissue patent by reissue patent number and reissue  application number as required by paragraph (c) of this section and  should also include the original patent number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maintenance fee payments and surcharge payments relating thereto  must be submitted separate from any other payments for fees or charges,  whether submitted in the manner set forth in Sec.  1.23 or by an  authorization to charge a deposit account. If maintenance fee and  surcharge payments for more than one patent are submitted together, they  should be submitted on as few sheets as possible with the patent numbers  listed in increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is  insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and surcharges for all the  listed patents, the payment will be applied in the order the patents are  listed, beginning at the top of the listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification of any change in status resulting in loss of  entitlement to small entity status must be filed in a patent prior to  paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest maintenance fee due after  the date on which status as a small entity is no longer appropriate. See  Sec.  1.27(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Maintenance fees and surcharges relating thereto will not be  refunded   except in accordance with Sec. Sec.  1.26 and 1.28(a).
