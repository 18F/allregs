                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Each expense must be reported under only  one type of expense, unless a portion of the expense fits under the  definition of or criteria for one type of expense and the remainder fits  into a different type of expense, in which case the expense must be pro- rated between types of expenses. Expenditures that benefit lines of  business or products other than those being reported, including but not  limited to those that are for or benefit self-funded plans, must be  reported on a pro rata share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of the methods used to allocate expenses. The report  required in Sec. 158.110 of this subpart must include a detailed  description of the methods used to allocate expenses, including incurred  claims, quality improvement expenses, Federal and State taxes and  licensing or regulatory fees, and other non-claims costs, to each health  insurance market in each State. A detailed description of each expense  element must be provided, including how each specific expense meets the  criteria for the type of expense in which it is categorized, as well as  the method by which it was aggregated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allocation to each category should be based on a generally  accepted accounting method that is expected to yield the most accurate  results. Specific identification of an expense with an activity that is  represented by one of the categories above will generally be the most  accurate method. If a specific identification is not feasible, the  issuer should provide an explanation of why it believes the more  accurate result will be gained from allocation of expenses based upon  pertinent factors or ratios such as studies of employee activities,  salary ratios or similar analyses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Many entities operate within a group where personnel and  facilities are shared. Shared expenses, including expenses under the  terms of a management contract, must be apportioned pro rata to the  entities incurring the expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any basis adopted to apportion expenses must be that which is  expected to yield the most accurate results and may result from special  studies of employee activities, salary ratios, premium ratios or similar  analyses. Expenses that relate solely to the operations of a reporting  entity, such as personnel costs associated with the adjusting and paying  of claims, must be borne solely by the reporting entity and are not to  be apportioned to other entities within a group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure of allocation methods. The issuer must identify in  the report required in Sec. 158.110 of this subpart the specific basis  used to allocate expenses reported under this part to States and, within  States, to lines of business including the individual market, small  group market, large group market, supplemental health insurance  coverage, health insurance coverage offered to beneficiaries of public  programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and group health plans as  defined in Sec. 145.103 of this chapter and administered by the issuer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance of records. The issuer must maintain and make  available to the Secretary upon request the data used to allocate  expenses reported under this part together with all supporting  information required to determine that the methods identified and  reported as required under paragraph   (b) of this section were accurately implemented in preparing the report  required in Sec. 158.110 of this subpart.</p>
