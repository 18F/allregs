                                Sec. 784.1  Complementary access: General information on the purpose
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. The Additional Protocol requires that the United States provide the IAEA with complementary access to locations specified in the U.S. declaration. The IAEA may request and be given complementary access to locations in the United States that are not included in the U.S. declaration as agreed to by the U.S. Government. The IAEA, upon request, will be granted complementary access to locations in the United States in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 784.3 of the APR, which describes the scope and conduct of complementary access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purposes authorized under the APR. The APR authorize the conduct of complementary access, at locations in the United States, for the following purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Declared uranium hard-rock mines and ore beneficiation plants. Complementary access may be conducted, on a selective basis, to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and nuclear related activities at reportable uranium hard-rock mines and ore beneficiation plants (see Sec. 783.1(a)(3) of the APR).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other locations specified in the U.S. declaration and locations requested by the IAEA that are not included in the U.S. declaration as agreed to by the U.S. Government. Complementary access may be conducted at other locations specified in the U.S. declaration (i.e., locations required to submit reports to BIS pursuant to Sec. 783.1(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) of the APR), and locations requested by the IAEA and agreed to by the U.S. Government, to resolve questions relating to the correctness and completeness of the information provided in the U.S. declaration or to resolve inconsistencies relating to that information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the event that the IAEA has a question about, or identifies an apparent inconsistency in, information contained in the U.S. declaration (e.g., information based on reports submitted to BIS by one of these locations, pursuant to Sec. 783.1(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b) of the APR), the IAEA will provide the U.S. Government with an opportunity to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency. The IAEA will not draw any conclusions about the question or inconsistency, or request complementary access to a location, until the U.S. Government has been provided with an opportunity to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency, unless the IAEA considers that a delay in access would prejudice the purpose for which the access is sought.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon receipt of a request from the IAEA for clarification concerning information contained in the U.S. declaration, BIS will provide written notification to the U.S. location. The U.S. location must provide BIS with all of the requested information to clarify or resolve the question or inconsistency raised by the IAEA. Unless informed otherwise by BIS, the U.S. location will have 15 calendar days from its receipt of written notification to submit the required forms to BIS (see the Supplemental Information Report requirements in Sec. 783.1(d) of the APR).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Locations subject to complementary access. All locations specified in the U.S. declaration and other locations requested by the IAEA and agreed to by the U.S. Government are subject to complementary access by the IAEA. In cases where access cannot be provided to locations specified by the IAEA, BIS may seek to provide complementary access to adjacent locations or to satisfy the purposes of complementary access (see paragraph (b) of this section) through other means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Responsibilities of BIS. As the lead U.S. Government agency and point of contact for organizing and facilitating complementary access pursuant to the APR, BIS will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Serve as the official U.S. Government host to the IAEA inspection team;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide prior written notification to any location that is scheduled to undergo complementary access;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Take appropriate action to obtain an administrative warrant in the event that a location does not consent to complementary access;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon request of the location, dispatch an advance team, if time and other circumstances permit, to the location to provide administrative and logistical support for complementary access and to assist with preparation for such access;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Accompany the IAEA Team throughout the duration of complementary access;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Assist the IAEA Team with complementary access activities and ensure that each activity adheres to the provisions of the Additional Protocol and to the requirements of the APR and the Act, including the conditions of any warrant issued thereunder; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Assist in the negotiation and development of a location-specific subsidiary arrangement between the U.S. Government and the IAEA, if appropriate (see Sec. 784.5 of the APR).</p><p class="depth3">Note to Sec. 784.1(d): BIS may invite representatives from other U.S. Government agencies to participate as members of the Advance and Host Teams for complementary access. The Host Team will not include employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor.</p>
