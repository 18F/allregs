The size of the market for each housing goal shall be established annually by FHFA for each Bank district based on data reported pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for a given year. Unless otherwise adjusted by FHFA, the size of the market for each Bank district shall be determined based on the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only owner-occupied, conventional loans secured by property located in that Bank district shall be considered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Purchase money mortgages and refinancing mortgages shall be counted only for the applicable housing goal or goals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All mortgages flagged as HOEPA loans or subordinate lien loans shall be excluded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All mortgages with original principal balances above the conforming loan limits for single unit properties for the year being evaluated (rounded to the nearest $1,000) shall be excluded;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All mortgages with rate spreads of 150 basis points or more above the applicable average prime offer rate as reported in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data shall be excluded; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All mortgages that are missing information necessary to determine appropriate counting under the housing goals shall be excluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Low-income families housing goal. For a Bank that is subject to the housing goals, the percentage share of such Bank's total purchases of purchase money AMA-approved mortgages on owner-occupied single-family housing that consists of mortgages for low-income families shall meet or exceed the share of such mortgages in the market as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Low-income areas housing goal. For a Bank that is subject to the housing goals, the percentage share of such Bank's total purchases of purchase money AMA-approved mortgages on owner-occupied single-family housing that consists of mortgages for families in low-income areas shall meet or exceed the share of such mortgages in the market as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Very low-income families housing goal. For a Bank that is subject to the housing goals, the percentage share of such Bank's total purchases of purchase money AMA-approved mortgages on owner-occupied single-family housing that consists of mortgages for very low-income families shall meet or exceed the share of such mortgages in the market as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Refinancing housing goal. For a Bank that is subject to the housing goals, the percentage share of such Bank's total purchases of refinancing AMA-approved mortgages on owner-occupied single-family housing that consists of refinancing mortgages for low-income families shall meet or exceed the share of such mortgages in the market as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
