                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the agency accredits institutions, it must maintain adequate substantive change policies that ensure that any substantive change to the educational mission, program, or programs of an institution after the agency has accredited or preaccredited the institution does not adversely affect the capacity of the institution to continue to meet the agency's standards. The agency meets this requirement if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The agency requires the institution to obtain the agency's approval of the substantive change before the agency includes the change in the scope of accreditation or preaccreditation it previously granted to the institution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The agency's definition of substantive change includes at least the following types of change:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any change in the established mission or objectives of the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The addition of courses or programs that represent a significant departure from the existing offerings of educational programs, or method of delivery, from those that were offered when the agency last evaluated the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The addition of programs of study at a degree or credential level different from that which is included in the institution's current accreditation or preaccreditation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A change from clock hours to credit hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A substantial increase in the number of clock or credit hours awarded for successful completion of a program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If the agency's accreditation of an institution enables the institution to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the entering into a contract under which an institution or organization not certified to participate in the title IV, HEA programs offers more than 25 percent of one or more of the accredited institution's educational programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)(A)</em> If the agency's accreditation of an institution enables it to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the establishment of an additional location at which the institution offers at least 50 percent of an educational program. The addition of such a location must be approved by the agency in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section unless the accrediting agency determines, and issues a written determination stating that the institution has--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the agency's accreditation of an institution enables it to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the establishment of an additional location at which the institution offers at least 50 percent of an educational program. The addition of such a location must be approved by the agency in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section unless the accrediting agency determines, and issues a written determination stating that the institution has--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Successfully completed at least one cycle of accreditation of maximum length offered by the agency and one renewal, or has been accredited for at least ten years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At least three additional locations that the agency has approved; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Met criteria established by the agency indicating sufficient capacity to add additional locations without individual prior approvals, including at a minimum satisfactory evidence of a system to ensure quality across a distributed enterprise that includes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Clearly identified academic control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Regular evaluation of the locations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adequate faculty, facilities, resources, and academic and student support systems;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Financial stability; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Long-range planning for expansion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The agency's procedures for approval of an additional location, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section, must require timely reporting to the agency of every additional location established under this approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each agency determination or redetermination to preapprove an institution's addition of locations under paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section may not exceed five years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The agency may not preapprove an institution's addition of locations under paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section after the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control as defined in 34 CFR 600.31 until the institution demonstrates that it meets the conditions for the agency to preapprove additional locations described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The agency must have an effective mechanism for conducting, at reasonable intervals, visits to a representative sample of additional locations approved under paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The acquisition of any other institution or any program or location of another institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The addition of a permanent location at a site at which the institution is conducting a teach-out for students of another institution that has ceased operating before all students have completed their program of study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The agency's substantive change policy must define when the changes made or proposed by an institution are or would be sufficiently extensive to require the agency to conduct a new comprehensive evaluation of that institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The agency may determine the procedures it uses to grant prior approval of the substantive change. However, these procedures must specify an effective date, which is not retroactive, on which the change is included in the

program's or institution's accreditation. An agency may designate the date of a change in ownership as the effective date of its approval of that substantive change if the accreditation decision is made within 30 days of the change in ownership. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, these procedures may, but need not, require a visit by the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(A) of this section, if the agency's accreditation of an institution enables the institution to seek eligibility to participate in title IV, HEA programs, the agency's procedures for the approval of an additional location where at least 50 percent of an educational program is offered must provide for a determination of the institution's fiscal and administrative capacity to operate the additional location. In addition, the agency's procedures must include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A visit, within six months, to each additional location the institution establishes, if the institution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has a total of three or fewer additional locations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has not demonstrated, to the agency's satisfaction, that it has a proven record of effective educational oversight of additional locations; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Has been placed on warning, probation, or show cause by the agency or is subject to some limitation by the agency on its accreditation or preaccreditation status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An effective mechanism for conducting, at reasonable intervals, visits to a representative sample of additional locations of institutions that operate more than three additional locations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An effective mechanism, which may, at the agency's discretion, include visits to additional locations, for ensuring that accredited and preaccredited institutions that experience rapid growth in the number of additional locations maintain educational quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The purpose of the visits described in paragraph (c) of this section is to verify that the additional location has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have in its application to the agency for approval of the additional location.
