The provisions of section 810 (a)  and (b) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Assume the following facts with respect to R, a life  insurance company:  Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at         $940</p><p class="depth2">beginning of taxable year.................................. Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at        1,060</p><p class="depth2">end of taxable year........................................ Required interest (as defined in section 809(a)(2)).........          70 Investment yield (as defined in section 804(c)).............         100 Amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from          70</p><p class="depth2">operations for the taxable year by reason of section</p><p class="depth2">809(a)(1)..................................................</p><p class="depth2">In order to determine the adjustment for decrease or increase in the sum  of the items described in section 810(c) for the taxable year, R must  first reduce the sum of such items at the end of the taxable year  ($1,060) by the amount of investment yield ($70) not included in gain or  loss from operations for the taxable year by reason of section  809(a)(1). Since the adjusted sum of such items at the end of the  taxable year, $990 ($1,060 minus $70), exceeds the sum of such items at  the beginning of the taxable year, $940, the excess of $50 ($990 minus  $940) shall be taken into account as a net increase under section  809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.809-5 in determining gain or  loss from operations.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except  that the sum of the items described in section 810(c) at the beginning  of the taxable year is $1000. Since the sum of the items described in  section 810(c) at the beginning of taxable year, $1000, exceeds the sum  of such items at the end of the taxable year after adjustment for the  amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from operations  for the taxable year by reason of section 809(a)(1), $990 ($1060 minus  $70), the excess of $10 ($1000 minus $990) shall be taken into account  as a net decrease under section 809 (c)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec.  1.809-4 in determining gain or loss from operations.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the following facts with respect to S, a life  insurance company:  Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at       $1,970</p><p class="depth2">beginning of taxable year.................................. Sum of items described in section 810(c) (1) through (6) at        2,040</p><p class="depth2">the end of taxable year....................................</p><p class="depth2">Required interest (as defined in section 809(a)(2)).........          60 Investment yield (as defined in section 804(c)).............          40 Amount of investment yield not included in gain or loss from          40</p><p class="depth2">operations by reason of section 809(a)(1)..................</p><p class="depth2">Under the provisions of section 809(a)(1), since the required interest  ($60) exceeds the investment yield ($40), the share of each and every  item of investment yield set aside for policyholders and not included in  gain or loss from operations for the taxable year shall be 100 percent.  Thus, applying the provisions of section 810 (a) and (b), the sum of the  items described in section 810(c) at the end of the taxable year  ($2,040) must first be reduced by the entire amount of the investment  yield ($40) in order to determine the net increase or decrease in the  sum of such items for the taxable year. Since the adjusted sum of such  items at the end of the taxable year, $2,000 ($2,040 minus $40), is  greater than the sum of such items at the beginning of the taxable year,  $1,970, the excess of $30 ($2,000 minus $1,970) shall be taken into  account as a net increase under section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2)  of Sec. 1.809-5 in determining gain or loss from operations. No  additional deduction is allowed under section 809(d) for the amount  ($20) by which the required interest exceeds the investment yield for  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Assume the facts are the same as in example 1, except  that as a result of a change in the basis used in computing an item  described in section 810(c) during the taxable year, the sum of such  items at the end of the taxable year is $1,200. Under the provisions of  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, any increase or decrease in the sum of  the section 810(c) items for the taxable year which is attributable to a  change in the basis used in computing such items during the taxable year  shall not be taken into account under section 810 (a) and (b). Thus, for  purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), the sum of the items described in  section 810(c) at the end of the taxable year shall be $1,060 (the  amount computed without regard to the change in basis) and S shall treat  the $50 computed in the manner described in example 1 as a net increase  under section 809(d)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.809-5 in  determining its gain or loss from operations for the taxable year. The  amount of the increase in the section 810(c) items which is attributable  to the change in basis during the taxable year, $140 ($1,200 minus  $1,060), shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in section  810(d) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.810-3.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. The life insurance reserves of M, a life insurance  company, computed with respect to contracts for which such reserves are  determined on a recognized preliminary term basis amount to $100 on  January 1, 1960, and $110 on December 31, 1960. For the taxable year  1960, M elects to revalue such reserves on a net level premium basis  under section 818(c). Such reserves computed under section 818(c) amount  to $115 on January 1, 1960, and $127 on December 31, 1960. Under the  provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a company which makes  the section 818(c) election must use the net level premium basis in  computing the sum of its life insurance reserves at the beginning and  end of all taxable years for which the election applies. Thus, for  purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), in determining whether there is a  net increase or decrease in the sum of the section 810(c) items for the  taxable year 1960, M shall include $115 as its reserves with respect to  such contracts under section 810(c)(1) at the beginning of the taxable  year and $127 as its reserves with respect to such contracts under  section 810(c)(1) at the end of the taxable year.
