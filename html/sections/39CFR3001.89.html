In the interest of expedition, any  participant may serve upon any other participant a written request for  the admission of any relevant, unprivileged facts, including the  genuineness of any documents or exhibits to be presented in the hearing.  The admission shall be for purposes of the pending proceeding only. The  participant requesting the admission shall file its request with the  Commission in conformance with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Answers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A matter for which admission is requested shall be  separately set forth in the request and is deemed admitted unless,  within 7 days after the request is filed, or within such other period as  may be established by the Commission or presiding officer, the  respondent files a written answer or motion to be excused from answering  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Answers to requests for  admission shall be filed with the Commission in conformance with  Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the answer filed by the respondent does not admit a matter  asserted in   the participant's request, it must either specifically deny the matter  or explain in detail why it cannot truthfully admit or deny the asserted  matter. When good faith requires, the respondent must admit a portion of  the asserted matter and either deny or qualify the remaining portion of  such asserted matter. Lack of knowledge for failing to admit or deny can  be invoked only after reasonable inquiry if the information already  possessed or reasonably obtainable is insufficient to enable an  admission or denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Grounds for objection to requests for admission must be stated.  Objections cannot be based solely upon the ground that the request  presents a genuine issue for trial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motion to be excused from answering. A respondent may, in lieu  of answering a request for admission, file a motion pursuant to Sec.  3001.75(b) to be excused from answering.</p>
