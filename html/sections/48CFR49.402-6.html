                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the supplies or services are still required after  termination, the contracting officer shall repurchase the same or  similar supplies or services against the contractor's account as soon as  practicable. The contracting officer shall repurchase at as reasonable a  price as practicable, considering the quality and delivery requirements.  The contracting officer may repurchase a quantity in excess of the  undelivered quantity terminated for default when the excess quantity is  needed, but excess cost may not be charged against the defaulting  contractor for more than the undelivered quantity terminated for default  (including variations in quantity permitted by the terminated contract).  Generally, the contracting officer will make a decision whether or not  to repurchase before issuing the termination notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the repurchase is for a quantity not over the undelivered  quantity terminated for default, the Default clause authorizes the  contracting officer to use any terms and acquisition method deemed  appropriate for the repurchase. However, the contracting officer shall  obtain competition to the maximum extent practicable for the repurchase.  The contracting officer shall cite the Default clause as the authority.  If the repurchase is for a quantity over the undelivered quantity  terminated for default, the contracting officer shall treat the entire  quantity as a new acquisition. If the repurchase is for a quantity over  the undelivered quantity terminated for default, the contracting officer  shall treat the entire quantity as a new acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If repurchase is made at a price over the price of the supplies  or services terminated, the contracting officer shall, after completion  and final payment of the repurchase contract, make a written demand on  the contractor for the total amount of the excess, giving consideration  to any increases or decreases in other costs such as transportation,  discounts, etc. If the contractor fails to make payment, the contracting  officer shall follow the procedures in subpart 32.6 for collecting  contract debts due the Government.
