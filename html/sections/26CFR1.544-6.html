                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  relating to stock not owned by an individual, shall be considered as  actually owned by such person for the purpose of again applying such  rule or of applying the family and partnership rule provided in section  544(a)(2), in order to make another person the constructive owner of  such stock, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> in order to make another person the constructive owner  of such stock, but</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Stock constructively owned by an individual by reason of the  application of the family and partnership rule provided in section  544(a)(2) shall not be considered as actually owned by such individual  for the purpose of again applying such rule in order to make another  individual the constructive owner of such stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A's wife, AW, owns all the stock of the M Corporation,  which in turn owns all the stock of the O Corporation. The O Corporation  in turn owns all the stock of the P   Corporation. Under the rule provided in section 544(a)(1), relating to  stock not owned by an individual, the stock in the P Corporation owned  by the O Corporation is considered to be owned constructively by the M  Corporation, the sole shareholder of the O Corporation. Such  constructive ownership of the stock of the M Corporation is considered  as actual ownership for the purpose of again applying such rule in order  to make AW, the sole shareholder of the M Corporation, the constructive  owner of the stock of the P Corporation. Similarly, the constructive  ownership of the stock by AW is considered as actual ownership for the  purpose of applying the family and partnership rule provided in section  544(a)(2) in order to make A the constructive owner of the stock of the  P Corporation, if such application is necessary for any of the purposes  set forth in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.544-1. But the stock thus  constructively owned by A may not be considered as actual ownership for  the purpose of again applying the family and partnership rule in order  to make another member of A's family, for example, A's father, the  constructive owner of the stock of the P Corporation.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. B, an individual, owns all the stock of the R Corporation  which has an option to acquire all the stock of the S Corporation, owned  by C, an individual, who is not related to B. Under the option rule  provided in section 544(a)(3) the R Corporation may be considered as  owning constructively the stock of the S Corporation owned by C. Such  constructive ownership of the stock by the R Corporation is considered  as actual ownership for the purpose of applying the rule provided in  section 544(a)(1), relating to stock not owned by an individual, in  order to make B, the sole shareholder of the R Corporation, the  constructive owner of the stock of the S Corporation. The stock thus  constructively owned by B by reason of the application of the rule  provided in section 544(a)(1) likewise is considered as actual ownership  for the purpose, if necessary, of applying the family and partnership  rule provided in section 544(a)(2), in order to make another member of  B's family, for example, B's wife, BW, the constructive owner of the  stock of the S Corporation. However, the family and partnership rule  could not again be applied so as to make still another individual the  constructive owner of the stock of the S Corporation, that is, the stock  constructively owned by BW could not be considered as actually owned by  her in order to make BW's father the constructive owner of such stock by  a second application of the family and partnership rule.</p>
