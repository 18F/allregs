                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The rules in this section apply for purposes of section 936(h) and  also for purposes of section 934(e) where applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Cost sharing option--(1) Product area research.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: Cost sharing payments are based on research undertaken by the  affiliated group in the ``product area'' which includes the possession  product. The term ``product area'' is defined by reference to the three- digit classification under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)  code. Which governmental agency has jurisdiction to decide the proper  SIC category for any specfic product?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: Solely for the purpose of determining the tax consequences of  operating in a possession, the Secretary or his delegate has exclusive  jurisdiction to decide the proper SIC category under which a product is  classified. For this purpose, the product area under which a product is  classified will be determined according to the 1972 edition   of the SIC code. From time to time and in appropriate cases, the  Secretary may prescribe regulations or issue rulings determining the  proper SIC category under which a particular product is to be  classified, and may prescribe regulations for aggregating two or more  three-digit classifications of the SIC code and for classifying product  areas according to a system other than under the SIC code.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: How is the term ``affiliated group'' defined for purposes of  the cost sharing option?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: For purposes of the cost sharing option, the term ``affiliated  group'' means the possessions corporation and all other organizations,  trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not  organized in the United States, and whether or not affiliated) owned or  controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, within the  meaning of section 482.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: Are research and development expenditures that are included in  product area research limited to research and development expenditures  that are deductible under section 174 or that are incurred by U.S.  affiliates?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: No, product area research is not limited to product area  research expenditures deductible under section 174 or to expenses  incurred by U.S. affiliates. Product area research also includes  deductions permitted under section 168 with respect to research property  which are not deductible under section 174; qualified research expenses  within the meaning of section 30(b); payments (such as royalities) for  the use of, or right to use, a patent, invention, formula, process,  design, pattern or know-how; and a proper allowance for amounts incurred  in the acquisition of manufacturing intangible property. In the case of  an acquisition of depreciable or amortizable manufacturing intangible  property, the annual amount of product area research shall be be equal  to the allowable depreciation or amortization on the intangible property  for the taxable year. In the case of an acquisition of nondepreciable or  nonamortizable manufacturing intangible property, the amount expended  for the acquisition shall be deemed to be amortized over a five year  period and included in product area research in the year of the deemed  amortization. Any contingent payment made with respect to the  acquisition of nonamortizable manufacturing intangible property shall be  treated as amounts incurred in the acquisition of nonamortizable  manufacturing intangible property when paid or accrued.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: Does royalty income from a person outside the affiliated group  with respect to the manufacturing intangibles within a product area  reduce the product area research pool within the same product area?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: Yes.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 5: Does income received from a person outside the affiliated  group from the sale of a manufacturing intangible reduce the product  area research pool within the same product area?</p><p class="depth0">A. 5: In determining product area research, the income from the sale  attributable to noncontingent payments will reduce product area research  ratably over the remaining useful life of the property in the case of an  amortizable intangible and ratably over a 5-year period in the case of a  nonamortizable intangible. Any income attributable to contingent amounts  received with respect to the sale of manufacturing intangible property  shall be treated as amounts received from the sale of the manufacturing  intangible property in the year in which such contingent amounts are  received or accrued.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 6: If a member of an affiliated group incurs research and  development expenses pursuant to a contract with an unrelated person who  is entitled to exclusive ownership of all the technology resulting from  the expenditures, is the amount of product area research reduced by the  amount of such expenditures?</p><p class="depth0">A. 6: To the extent that the product area research expenditures can  be allocated solely to the technology produced for the unrelated person,  such expenditures will not be included in product area research  expenditures provided, however, that the unrelated person has exclusive  ownership of all the technology resulting from these expenditures, and  further that no member of the affiliated group has a right to use any of  the technology.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 7: What is the treatment of product area research expenditures  attributable to a component where the component and the integrated  product fall within different product areas?</p><p class="depth0">A. 7: For purposes of the computation of product area research  expenditures in the product area by the affiliated group, the product  area in which the component falls is aggregated with the product area in  which the integrated product falls. However, if the component product  and integrated product are in separate SIC codes and if the component  product is not included in the definition of the possession product,  then the product area research expenditures are not aggregated. The same  rule applies where the taxpayer elects a component product which  encompasses another component product and the two component products  fall into separate SIC codes. In such case, the product area in which  the first component falls is aggregated with the product area in which  the second component falls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Possession sales and total sales.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: The cost sharing payment is the same proportion of the total  cost of product area research which the amount of ``possession sales''  of the affiliated group bears to the ``total sales'' of the affiliated  group within the product area. How are ``possession sales'' defined for  purposes of the cost sharing fraction?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: The term ``possession sales'' means the aggregate sales or  other dispositions of the possession product, to persons who are not  members of the affiliated group, less returns and allowances and less  indirect taxes imposed on the production of the product, for the taxable  year. Except as otherwise indicated in Sec. 1.936-6(a)(2), the sales  price to be used is the sales price received by the affiliated group  from persons who are not members of the affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: For purposes of the numerator of the cost sharing fraction,  how are possession sales computed where the possession product is a  component product or an end-product form?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: (i) The sales price of the component product or end-product  form is determined as follows. With respect to a component product, an  independent sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions must  be used if such price can be determined in accordance with Sec. 1.482- 2(e)(2). If an independent sales price of the component product from  comparable uncontrolled transactions cannot be determined, then the  sales price of the component product shall be deemed to be equal to the  transfer price, determined under the appropriate section 482 method,  which the possessions corporation uses under the cost sharing method in  computing the income it derives from the active conduct of a trade or  business in the possession with respect to the component product. The  possessions corporation in lieu of using the transfer price determined  under the preceding sentence may treat the sales price for the component  product as equal to the same proportion of the third party sales price  of the integrated product which the production costs attributable to the  component product bear to the total production cost for the integrated  product. Production cost will be the sum of direct and indirect  production costs as defined in Sec. 1.936-5(b)(4). If the possessions  corporation determines the sales price of the component product using  the production cost ratio, the transfer price used by the possessions  corporation in computing its income from the component product under the  cost sharing method may not be greater than such sales price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to an end-product form, the sales price of the  end-product form is equal to the difference between the third party  sales price of the integrated product and the independent sales price of  the excluded component(s) from comparable uncontrolled transactions, if  such price can be determined under Sec. 1.482-2(e)(2). If an independent  sales price of the excluded component(s) from uncontrolled transactions  cannot be determined, then the sales price of the end-product form shall  be deemed to be equal to the transfer price, determined under the  appropriate section 482 method, which the possessions corporation uses  under the cost sharing method in computing the income it derives from  the active conduct of a trade or business in the possession with respect  to such end-   product form. The possessions corporation in lieu of using the transfer  price determined under the preceding sentence may use the production  cost ratio method described above to determine the sales price of the  end-product form (i.e., the same proportion of the third party sales  price of the integrated product which the production costs attributable  to the end-product form bear to the total production costs for the  integrated product). If the possessions corporation determines the sales  price of the end-product form using the production cost ratio, the  transfer price used by the possessions corporation in computing its  income from the end-product form under the cost sharing method may not  be greater than such sales price. For similar rules applicable to the  profit split option see Sec. 1.936-6(b)(1), question and answer 12.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: For purposes of determining possessions sales in the numerator  of the cost sharing fraction, will the replacement part price of the  product be treated as a price from comparable uncontrolled transactions?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: Prices for replacement parts are generally higher than prices  for equipment sold as part of an original system. Thus, prices for  replacement parts cannot generally be used directly as prices for  comparable uncontrolled transactions. However, replacement part prices  may be used for estimating comparable uncontrolled prices where the  price differential can be reasonably determined and taken into account  under Sec. 1.482-2(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: For purposes of determining possession sales in the cost  sharing fraction, what is the treatment of components that are purchased  by one possessions corporation from an affiliated possessions  corporation and which are incorporated into a possession product where  the transferor possessions corporation treats the transferred component  as a possession product?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: When one possessions corporation purchases components from a  second possessions corporation which is an affiliated corporation, the  purchase price of the components paid to the second possessions  corporation shall be subtracted from the sales proceeds of the product  produced in the possession by the first possessions corporation, and  only the remainder is included in the numerator of the cost sharing  formula for the first corporation. For example, assume that N  corporation manufactures a component for sale to O corporation for $100  (a price which reflects prices in comparable uncontrolled transactions).  Both N and O are affiliated possessions corporations. N has designated  that component product as its possession product. O then incorporates  that product into a second product which is sold to customers for $300 N  and O must make separate cost sharing payments. The cost sharing payment  of N corporation is determined by including $100 as possession sales,  and the payment of O is determined by subtracting that $100 purchase  price from the $300 received from customers. Thus, the possessions sales  amount of O is $200. This rule is intended to prevent the double  counting of the sales of a component produced by one possessions  corporation and incorporated into another product by an affiliated  possessions corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 5: Are pre-TEFRA sales included in the cost sharing fraction?</p><p class="depth0">A. 5: No. Pre-TEFRA sales are sales of products produced by the  possessions corporation and transferred to an affiliate prior to a  possessions corporation's first taxable year beginning after December  31, 1982. Pre-TEFRA sales are not included in either the numerator or  denominator of the cost sharing fraction. If the U.S. affiliate uses the  FIFO method of costing inventory, the pre-TEFRA inventory will be  treated as the first inventory sold by the U.S. affiliate during the  first year in which section 936(h) applies. If the U.S. affiliate uses  the LIFO method of costing inventory (either dollar-value or specific  goods LIFO), pre-TEFRA inventor will be treated as inventory sold by the  U.S. affiliate in the year in which the U.S. afiliate's LIFO layer  containing pre-TEFRA LIFO inventory is liquidated.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 6: How are ``possession sales'' determined under the cost sharing  formula if members of the affiliated group (other than the possessions  corporation) include purchases of the possession product, X, in a  dollar-value LIFO   inventory pool (as provided under Sec. 1.472-8)?</p><p class="depth0">A. 6: Possession sales may be determined by applying the revenue  identification method provided under paragraph (b)(1) Question and  Answer 18 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 7: Do possession sales include excise taxes paid by the  possessions corporation when the product is sold for ultimate use or  consumption in the possession?</p><p class="depth0">A. 7: No. The amount of excise taxes is excluded from both the  numerator and denominator of the cost sharing fraction.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 8: How are ``total sales'' defined for purposes of the cost  sharing fraction?</p><p class="depth0">A. 8: The term ``total sales'' means aggregate sales or other  dispositions of products in the same product area as the possession  product, less returns and allowances and less indirect taxes imposed on  the production of the product, for the taxable year to persons who are  not members of the affiliated group. The sales price to be used is the  sales price received by the affiliated group from persons who are not  members of the affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 9: In computing that cost sharing payment, how are ``total  sales'' computed if the dollar-value LIFO inventory pool includes some  products which are not included in the product area (determined under  the 3-digit SIC code) on which the denominator of the cost sharing  fraction is based?</p><p class="depth0">A. 9: In such case, the amount of the total sales within the product  area to persons who are not members of the affiliated group by persons  who are members of the affiliated group is determined by multiplying the  total sales of the products within the dollar-value LIFO inventory pool  by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction includes the dollar-value  of purchases by members of the affiliated group (including the  possessions corporation) of products within the product area made during  the year, plus any added production costs (as defined in Sec. 1.471- 11(b), (c), and (d) but not including the costs of materials) incurred  by the affiliates during the same period. The denominator of the  fraction includes the dollar-value of purchases by members of the  affiliated group (including the possessions corporation) of products  within the dollar-value LIFO inventory pool made during the same period  (including any production costs, as described above, incurred by the  affiliate during the same period). For these purposes, purchases of a  possession product are determined on the basis of the possessions  corporation's cost for its inventory purposes.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 10: May a possessions corporation compute its income under the  cost sharing method with respect to a possession product which the  possessions corporation sells to a member of its affiliated group and  which that member then leases to an unrelated person or uses in its own  trade or business?</p><p class="depth0">A. 10: Yes, provided that an independent sales price for the  possession product from comparable uncontrolled transactions can be  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.482-2(e)(2), and, provided further,  that such member complies with the requirements of Sec. 1.936-6(a)(2),  question and answer 14. If, however, there is a comparable uncontrolled  price for an integrated product and the possession product is a  component product or end-product form thereof, the possessions  corporation may, if such member complies with the requirements of  Sec. 1.936-6(a)(2), question and answer 14, compute its income under the  cost sharing method with respect to such possession product. In that  case, the cost sharing payment shall be computed under the following  question and answer.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 11: How are possession sales and total sales to be determined for  purposes of computing the cost sharing payment with respect to a  possession product which the possessions corporation sells to a member  of its affiliated group where that member then leases the possession  product to unrelated persons or uses it in its own trade or business?</p><p class="depth0">A. 11: If the possessions corporation is entitled to compute its  income from such sales of the possession product under the cost sharing  method, both possession sales and total sales shall be determined as if  the possession product   had been sold by the affiliate to an unrelated person at the time the  possession product was first leased or otherwise placed in service by  the affiliate. The sales price on such deemed sale shall be equal to the  independent sales price from comparable uncontrolled transactions  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.482-2(e)(2), if any. If the  possession product is a component product or an end-product form for  which there is no such independent sales price but there is a comparable  uncontrolled price for the integrated product which includes the  possession product, the deemed sales price of the possession product  shall be computed under the rules of Sec. 1.936-6(a)(2) question and  answer 2. The full amount of income received under the lease shall be  treated as income of (and taxed to) the affiliate and not the  possessions corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 12: When may a possessions corporation take into account in  computing total sales under the cost sharing method products in the same  product area as the possession product (other than the possession  product itself) where such products are leased by members of the  affiliated group to unrelated persons or used by any such member in its  own trade or business?</p><p class="depth0">A. 12: For purposes of computing total sales under the cost sharing  method, the possessions corporation may take into account products in  the same product area as the possession product itself where such  products are leased by members of the affiliated group to unrelated  persons or used in the trade or business of any such member, but only if  an independent sales price of such products from comparable uncontrolled  transactions may be determined under Sec. 1.482-2(e)(2). In such cases,  the units of such products which are leased or otherwise used internally  by members of the affiliated group may be treated as sold to unrelated  persons for such independent sales price for purposes of computing total  sales.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 13: Assuming that a possessions corporation is entitled to  compute its income under the cost sharing method with respect to sales  of a possession product to affiliates in cases where those affiliates  lease units of the possession product to unrelated persons or use them  internally, is the possessions corporation's income from the possession  product any different than if the affiliates had sold the product to  unrelated parties?</p><p class="depth0">A. 13: No.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 14: If a possessions corporation sells units of a possession  product to a member of its affiliated group and that affiliate then  leases those units to an unrelated person or uses the units in its own  trade or business, what requirements must the affilate meet in order for  the possessions corporation to be entitled to the benefits of the cost  sharing method with respect to such units?</p><p class="depth0">A. 14: (i) For taxable years of the possessions corporation  beginning on or before June 13, 1986, the affiliate need not meet any  special requirements in order for the possessions corporation to be  entitled to the beneifts of the cost sharing method with respect to such  units. Thus, the affiliate's basis in such units shall be equal to the  transfer price used for computing the possessions corporation's gross  income with respect to such units under section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(II), and  the income derived by the affiliate from such lease or internal use  shall be reported by the affiliate when and to the extent actually  derived. The affiliate shall not be deemed to have sold such units to an  unrelated party at the time they were first leased or otherwise placed  in service for any purpose other than the computation of possession  sales and total sales. A similar rule applies to other products in the  same product area as the possession product which are sold by any member  in its own trade or business and which the possessions corporation takes  into account in computing total sales under the cost sharing method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For taxable years of the possessions corporations beginning  after June 13, 1986, a possessions corporations will not be entitled to  the benefits of the cost sharing method with respect to units of the  possession product which the possessions corporation sells to an  affiliate where the affiliate then leases such units to an unrelated  person or uses them in its own trade or business, unless the affiliate  agrees to be treated for all tax purposes as having sold such units to  an unrelated   party at the time they were first leased or otherwise placed in service  by such affiliate. The affiliate must demonstrate such agreement by  reporting its income from such units as if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It had sold such units to an unrelated person at such time at a  price equal to the price used to compute possessions sales under  Sec. 1.936-6(a)(2), question and answer 11;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It had immediately repurchased such units for the same price;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Its basis in such units for all subsequent purposes was equal to  its cost basis from such deemed repurchase.  For treatment of other products in the same product area as the  possession product see Sec. 1.936-6(a)(2), question and answer 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The principles contained in questions and answers 11, 12, 13,  and 14 are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Possessions corporation S and its affiliate A are calendar  year taxpayers. In 1985, S manufactures 100 units of possession product  X. S sells 50 units of X to unrelated persons in arm's length  transactions for $10 per unit. In applying the cost sharing method to  determine the portion of its gross income from such sales which  qualifies for the possessions tax credit, S determines that $8 of the  $10 sales price may be taken into account. S sells the remaining 50  units of X to A, and A then leases such units to unrelated persons. In  1985, A also manufacturers 100 units of product Y, the only other  product in the same product area as X manufactured or sold by any member  of the affiliated group. A manufactured the 100 units of Y at a cost of  $15 per unit, sold 50 units of Y to unrelated persons in arm's length  transactions for $20 per unit, and leased the remaining 50 units of Y to  unrelated persons.</p><p class="depth0">S may compute its income under the cost sharing method with respect  to the 50 units of X it sold to A because S can determine an independent  sales price of X from comparable uncontrolled transactions under  Sec. 1.482-2(e)(2). For purposes of computing both possessions sales and  total sales, the 50 units of X sold to A will be deemed to have been  sold by A to an unrelated person for $10 per unit. The income of S  qualifying for the possessions tax credit from the sale of those 50  units of X to A, and A's basis in those units, will both be determined  using the $8 transfer price determined under section 936  (h)(5)(C)(i)(II). For purposes of computing total sales in the  denominator of the cost sharing fraction, S may also take into account  the 50 units of Y leased by A to unrelated persons, as if A had sold  those units for $20 per unit. A's basis in those units of Y will  continue to be its actual cost basis of $15 per unit.</p><p class="depth0">If all of the above transactions had occurred in 1987, S would be  entitled to compute its income under the cost sharing method with  respect to the 50 units of X it sold to A only if A agreed to be treated  for all tax purposes as if it had sold such units for $10 per unit,  realized income on such deemed sale of $2 per unit, repurchased such  units immediately for $10 per unit, and then leased such units, which  would then have a $10 per unit basis in A's hands. For purposes of  computing total sales, S would be entitled to take into account the 50  units of X leased by A to unrelated persons as if A had sold such units  for $20 per unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credits against cost sharing payments.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: Is the cost of product area research paid or accrued by the  possessions corporation in a taxable year creditable against the cost  sharing payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: Yes, if the cost of the product area research is paid or  accrued solely by the possessions corporation. Thus, payments by the  possessions corporation under cost sharing arrangements with, or  royalties paid to, unrelated persons are so creditable. Amounts (such as  royalties) paid directly or indirectly to, or on behalf of, related  persons and amounts paid under any cost sharing agreements with related  persons are not creditable against the cost sharing payment.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: Do royalties or other payments made by an affiliate of the  possessions corporation to another member of the affiliated group reduce  the cost sharing payment if such royalties or other payments are based,  in part, on activity of the possessions corporation?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: No. Payments made between affiliated corporations do not  reduce the cost sharing payment. Thus, for example, if a possessions  corporation sells a component to a foreign affiliate for incorporation  by the foreign affiliate into an integrated product sold to unrelated  persons, and the foreign affiliate pays a royalty to the U.S. parent of  the possessions corporation based on the total value of the integrated  product, the cost sharing payment of the possessions corporation is not  reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Computation of cost sharing payment.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: S is a possessions corporation engaged in the manufacture and  sale of   four products (A, B, C, and D) all of which are classified under the  same three-digit SIC code. S sells its production to a U.S. affiliate,  P, which resells it to unrelated parties in the United States. P's third  party sales of each of these products produced in whole or in part by S  (computed as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.936-6) are $1  million or a total of $4 million for A, B, C, and D. P's other sales of  products in the same SIC code are $3,000,000; and the defined worldwide  product area research of the affiliated group is $350,000. How should S  compute the cost sharing amount for products A, B, C, and D?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: The cost sharing amount is computed separately for each  product on Schedule P of Form 5735. S should use the following formula  for each of the products A, B, C, and D: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.006  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.007</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: The facts are the same as in question 1 except that S  manufactures product D under a license from an unrelated person. S pays  the unrelated party an annual license fee of $20,000. Thus, the  worldwide product area research expense of the affiliated group is  $370,000. How should the cost sharing payment be adjusted?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: The cost sharing fee should be reduced by the $20,000 license  fee made as a direct annual payment to a third party on account of  product D. The cost sharing payment with respect to product D in this  example will be adjusted as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.008  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.009</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: The facts are the same as in question 1 except that S also  manufactures and exports product E to a foreign affiliate, which resells  it to unrelated persons for $1 million. S makes a separate election for  its export sales. How should S compute the cost sharing amount for  product E?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: The numerator of the cost sharing fraction is the aggregate  sales or other dispositions by members of the affiliated group of the  units of product E produced in whole or in part in the possession to  persons who are not members of the affiliated group. The cost sharing  amount for product E would be computed as follows:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.010</p><p class="depth0">or [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC09OC91.011</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: The facts are the same as in question 1, except that S also  receives $10,000 in royalty income from unrelated persons for the  licensing of certain manufacturing intangible property rights. What is  the amount of the product area research that must be allocated in  determining the cost sharing amount?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: If the affiliated group receives royalty income from unrelated  persons with respect to manufacturing intangibles in the same product  area, then the product area research to be considered shall be first  reduced by such royalty income. In this case, the amount of product area  research to be used in determining S's cost sharing payment should be  reduced by the $10,000 royalty payment received to $340,000.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 5: May a possessions corporation redetermine the amount of its  required cost sharing payment after filing its tax return?</p><p class="depth0">A. 5: If after filing its tax return, a possessions corporation  files an amended return, or if an adjustment is made on audit, either of  which affects the amount of the cost sharing payment required, then a  redetermination of the cost sharing payment must be made. See, however,  section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(III)(a) with respect to the increase in the cost  sharing payment due to interest imposed under section 6601(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Effect of election under the cost sharing method.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: What is the effect of the cost sharing method?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: The cost sharing payment reduces the amount of deductions (and  the amount of reductions in earnings and profits) otherwise allowable to  the U.S. affiliates (other than tax-exempt affiliates) within the  affiliated group as determined under section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I)(b) which  have incurred research expenditures (as defined in Sec. 1.936-6(a)(1),  question and answer (3) in the same product area for which the cost  sharing option is elected, during the taxable year in which the cost  sharing payment accrues. If there are no such U.S. affiliates, the  reductions with respect to deductions and earnings and profits, as the  case may be, are made with respect to foreign affiliates within the same  affiliated group which have incurred product area research expenditures  in such product area attributable to a U.S. trade or business. If there  are no affiliates which have incurred research expenditures in such  product area, the reductions are then made with respect to any other  U.S. affiliate and, if there is no such U.S. affiliate, then to any  other foreign affiliate. The allocations of these reductions in each  case shall be made in proportion to the gross income of the affiliates.  In the case of foreign affiliates, the allocation shall be made in  proportion to gross income attributable to the U.S. trade or business or  worldwide gross income, as the case may be. With respect to each group  above, the reduction of deductions shall be applied first to deductions  under section 174, then to deductions under section 162, and finally to  any other deductions on a pro rata basis.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: For purposes of estimated tax payments, when is the cost  sharing amount deemed to accrue?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: The cost sharing amount is deemed to accrue to the appropriate  affiliate on the last day of the taxable year of each such affiliate in  which or with which the taxable year of the possessions corporation  ends.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: If the cost sharing method is elected and the year of accrual  of the cost sharing payment to the appropriate affiliate (described in  question and answer 1 of this paragraph (a)(5)) differs from the year of  actual payment by the possessions corporation, in what year are the  deductions of the recipients reduced?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: In the year the cost sharing payment has accrued.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: What is the treatment of income from intangibles under the  cost sharing method?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: Under the cost sharing method, a possessions corporation is  treated as the owner, for purposes of obtaining a return thereon, of  manufacturing intangibles related to a possession product. The term  ``manufacturing intangible'' means any patent, invention, formula,  process, design, pattern, or know-how. The possessions corporation will  not be treated as the owner, for purposes of obtaining a return thereon,  of any manufacturing intangibles related to a component product produced  by an affiliated corporation and transferred to the possessions  corporation for incorporation into the possession product, except in the  case that the possession product is treated as including such component  product for all purposes of section 936(h)(5). Further, the possessions  corporation will not be treated as the owner, for purposes of obtaining  a return thereon, of any marketing intangibles except ``covered  intangibles.'' (See Sec. 1.936-6(c).)</p><p class="depth0">Q. 5: If the cost sharing option is elected, is it necessary for the  possessions corporation to be the legal owner of the manufacturing  intangibles related to the possession product in order for the  possessions corporation to receive a full return with respect to such  intangibles?</p><p class="depth0">A. 5: No. There is no requirement that manufacturing intangibles be  owned by the possessions corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 6: How is income attributable to marketing intangibles treated  under the cost sharing method?</p><p class="depth0">A. 6: Except in the case of ``covered intangibles'' (see Sec. 1.936- 6(c)), the possessions corporation is not treated as the owner of any  marketing intangibles, and income attributable to marketing intangible  of the possessions corporation will be allocated to the possessions  corporation's U.S. shareholders with the proration of income based on  shareholdings. If a shareholder of the possessions corporation is a  foreign, person or is otherwise tax exempt, the possessions corporation  is taxable on that shareholder's pro rata amount of the intangible  property income. If the possessions corporation is a corporation any  class of the stock of which is regularly traded on an established  securities market, then the income attributable to marketing intangibles  will be taxable to the possessions corporation rather than the  corporation's U.S. shareholders.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 7: What is the source of the intangible property income described  in question and answer 6?</p><p class="depth0">A. 7: The intangible property income is U.S. source whether taxed to  the U.S. shareholder or taxed to the possessions corporation and section  863 (b) does not apply for this purpose. However, such intangible  property income, if treated as income of the possessions corporation,  does not enter into the calculation of the 80-percent possession source  test or the 65-percent active trade or business test.</p><p class="depth0">Q.7a: What is the source of the taxpayer's gross income derived from  a sale in the United States of a possession product purchased by the  taxpayer (or an affiliate) from a corporation that has an election in  effect under section 936, if the income from such sale is taken into  account to determine benefits under cost sharing for the section 936  corporation? Is the result different if the taxpayer (or an affiliate)  derives gross income from a sale in the United States of an integrated  product incorporating a possession product purchased by the taxpayer (or  an affiliate) from the section 936 corporation, if the taxpayer (or an  affiliate) processes the possession product or an excluded component in  the United States?</p><p class="depth0">A.7a: Under either scenario, the income is U.S. source, without  regard to whether the possession product is a   component, end-product, or integrated product. Section 863 does not  apply in determining the source of the taxpayer's income. This Q&A; 7a is  applicable for taxable years beginning on or after November 13, 1998.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 8: May marketing intangible income, if any, be allocated to the  possessions corporation with respect to custom-made products?</p><p class="depth0">A. 8: No. If the cost sharing option is elected, then income  attributable to marketing intangibles (other than ``covered  intangibles'' described in Sec. 1.936-6(c)) will be taxed as discussed  in questions and answers 6 and 7 of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. It  is immaterial whether the product is custom-made.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 9: In order to sell a pharmaceutical product in the United  States, a New Drug Application (``NDA'') for the product must be  approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Is an NDA considered  a manufacturing or marketing intangible for purposes of the allocation  of income under the cost sharing method?</p><p class="depth0">A. 9: A manufacturing intangible.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 10: Can a copyright be, in whole or in part, a manufacturing  intangible for purposes of the allocation of income under the cost  sharing method?</p><p class="depth0">A. 10: In general, a copyright is a marketing intangible. See  section 936(h)(3)(B)(ii). However, copyrights may be treated either as  manufacturing intangibles or nonmanufacturing intangibles (or as partly  each) depending upon the function or the use of the copyright. If the  copyright is used in manufacturing, it will be treated as a  manufacturing intangible; but if it is used in marketing, even if it is  also classified as know-how, it will be treated as a marketing  intangible.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 11: If the cost sharing option is elected and a patent is related  to the product produced by the possessions corporation, does the return  to the possessions corporation with respect to the manufacturing  intangible include the make, use, and sell elements of the patent?</p><p class="depth0">A. 11: Yes. A patent confers an exclusive right for 17 years to sell  a product covered by the patent. During this period, the return to the  possessions corporation includes the make, use and sell elements of the  patent.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 12: For purposes of the cost sharing option, may a safe haven  rule be applied to determine the amount of marketing intangible income?</p><p class="depth0">A. 12: No. The amount of marketing intangible income is determined  on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. The section 482  regulations will continue to apply except to the extent modified by the  election. Rev. Proc. 63-10 and Rev. Proc. 68-22 do not apply for this  purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 13: If a product covered by the cost sharing election is sold by  a possessions corporation to an affiliated corporation for resale to an  unrelated party, may the resale price method under section 482 be used  to determine the intercompany price of the possessions corporation?</p><p class="depth0">A. 13: In general, the resale price method may be used if (a) no  comparable uncontrolled price for the product exists, and (b) the  affiliated corporation does not add a substantial amount of value to the  product by manufacturing or by the provision of services which are  reflected in the sales price of the product to the customer. The  possessions corporation will not be denied use of the resale price  method for purposes of such inter-company pricing merely because the  reseller adds more than an insubstantial amount to the value of the  product by the use of intangible property.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 14: If a possessions corporation makes the cost sharing election  and uses the cost-plus method under section 482 to determine the arm's- length price of a possession product, will the cost base include the  cost of materials which are subject to processing or which are  components in the possession product?</p><p class="depth0">A. 14: A taxpayer may include the cost of materials in the cost base  if it is appropriate under the regulations under Sec. 1.482-2(e)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Q. 15: If the possessions corporation computes its income with  respect to a product under the cost sharing method, and the price of the  product is determined under the cost-plus method under section 482, does  the cost base   used in computing cost-plus under section 482 include the amount of the  cost sharing payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. 15: The amount of the cost sharing payment is included in the  cost base. However, no profit with respect to the cost sharing payment  will be allowed.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 16: If a member of the affiliated group transfers to a  possessions corporation a component which is incorporated into a  possession product, how will the transfer price for the component be  determined?</p><p class="depth0">A. 16: The transfer price for the component will be determined under  section 482, and as follows. If the possession product is treated as not  including such component for purposes of section 936(h)(5), the transfer  price paid for the component will include a return on all intangibles  related to the component product. If the possession product is treated  as including such component for purposes of section 936(h)(5), then the  transfer price paid for the component by the possessions corporation  will not include a return on any manufacturing intangible related to the  component product, and the possessions corporation will obtain the  return on the manufacturing intangibles associated with the component.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 17: If the possessions corporation computes its income with  respect to a product under the cost sharing method, with respect to  which units of the product shall the possessions corporation be treated  as owning intangible property as a result of having made the cost  sharing election?</p><p class="depth0">A. 17: The possessions corporation shall not be treated as owning  intangible property, as a result of having made the cost sharing  election, with respect to any units of a possession product which were  not taken into account by the possessions corporation in applying the  significant business presence test for the current taxable year or for  any prior taxable year in which the possessions corporation also had a  significant business presence in the possession with respect to such  product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Profit split option--(1) Computation of combined taxable income.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: In determining combined taxable income from sales of a  possession product, how are the allocations and apportionments of  expenses, losses, and other deductions to be determined?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: (i) Expenses, losses, and other deductions are to be allocated  and apportioned on a ``fully-loaded'' basis under Sec. 1.861-8 to the  combined gross income of the possessions corporation and other members  of the affiliated group (other than foreign affiliates). For purposes of  the profit split option, the term ``affiliated group'' is defined the  same as under Sec. 1.936-6 (a)(1) question and answer 2. The amount of  research, development, and experimental expenses allocated and  apportioned to combined gross income is to be determined under  Sec. 1.861-8(e)(3). The amount of research, development and experimental  expenses and related deductions (such as royalties paid or accrued with  respect to manufacturing intangibles by the possessions corporation or  other domestic members of the affiliated group to unrelated persons or  to foreign affiliates) allocated and apportioned to combined gross  income shall in no event be less than the amount of the cost sharing  payment that would have been required under the rules set forth in  section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(II) and paragraph (a) of this section if the  cost sharing option had been elected. Other expenses which are subject  to Sec. 1.861-8(e) are to be allocated and apportioned in accordance  with that section. For example, interest expense (including payments  made with respect to bonds issued by the Puerto Rican Industrial,  Medical and Environmental Control Facilities Authority (AFICA)) is to be  allocated and apportioned under Sec. 1.861-8(e)(2). With the exception  of marketing and distribution expenses discussed below, the other  remaining expenses which are definitely related to a class of gross  income shall be allocated to that class of gross income and shall be  apportioned on the basis of any reasonable method, as described in  Sec. 1.861-8 (b)(3) and (c)(1). Examples of such methods may include,  but are not limited to, those specified in Sec. 1.861-8(c)(1)(i) through  (vi).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The class of gross income to which marketing and distribution  expenses relate and shall be allocated is generally to be defined by the  same ``product area'' as is determined for the relevant research,  development, and   experimental expenses (i.e., the appropriate 3-digit SIC code), but  shall include only gross income generated or reasonably expected to be  generated from the geographic area or areas to which the expenses  relate. It shall be presumed that marketing and distribution expenses  relate to all product sales within the same product area. If, however,  it can be established that any of these expenses are separately  identifiable expenses, such as advertising, and relate, directly or  indirectly, solely to a specific product or a specific group of  products, such expenses shall be allocated to the class of gross income  defined by the specific product or group of products. Thus, advertising  and other separately identifiable marketing expenses which relate  specifically and exclusively to a particular product must be allocated  entirely to the gross income from that product, even though the taxpayer  or other members of an affiliated group which includes the taxpayer  produce and market other products in the same 3-digit SIC code  classification. The mere display of a company logo or mention of a  company name solely in the context of identifying the manufacturer shall  not prevent an advertisement from relating specifically and exclusively  to a particular product or group of products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If marketing and distribution expenses are allocated to a  class of gross income which consists both of income from sales of  possession products (the statutory grouping) and other income such as  from sale by U.S. affiliates of products not produced in the possession  (the residual grouping), then these marketing and distribution expenses  shall be apportioned on a ``fully loaded'' basis which reflects, to a  reasonably close extent, the factual relationship between these  deductions and the statutory and residual groupings of gross income.  Apportionment methods based upon comparisons of amounts incurred before  ultimate sale of a product (including apportionment on a comparison of  costs of goods sold, other expenses incurred, or other comparisons set  forth in Sec. 1.861-8 (c)(1)(v), such as time spent) are not on a  ``fully-loaded'' basis and do not reflect this required factual  relationship. These deductions shall be apportioned on a basis of  comparison of the amount of gross sales or receipts or another method if  it is established that such method similarly reflects the required  factual relationship. Thus, for example, a comparison of units sold may  be used only where the units are of the same or similar value and are,  thus, in fact comparable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The rules for allocation and apportionment of marketing and  distribution expenses may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume that possessions corporation A manufacturers  prescription pharmaceutical product 1 for resale by P, its U.S.  parent corporation, in the United States. Additionally, assume that P  manufactures prescription pharmaceutical products 2 and  3 in the United States for sale there. Further, assume that all  three products are within the same product area, and that marketing and  distribution expenses are internally divided by P among the three  products on the basis of time spent by sales persons of P on marketing  of the three products, as follows:  Product 1.............................................      50X Product 2.............................................      80X Product 3.............................................     110X</p><p class="depth0">--------</p><p class="depth0">Total......................................................     240X</p><p class="depth0">These expenses of 240X are allocated to gross income generated by all  three products and shall be apportioned on the basis of gross sales or  receipts of product 1 as compared to products 2 and  3 or another method which similarly reflects the factual  relationship between these expenses and gross income derived from  product 1 and products 2 and 3. Thus, if a  sales method were used and sales of product 1 accounted for  one-third of sales receipts from the three products, 80X (240 / 3) of  marketing and distribution expenses would be apportioned to the combined  gross income from product 1.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation B produces and sells Brand W whiskey, in the  United States. B's subsidiary, S, which is a possessions corporation,  produces soft drink extract in Puerto Rico which it sells to independent  bottlers to produce Brand S soft drinks for sale in the United States.  Corporation B's advertisements and other promotional materials for Brand  W whiskey make no reference to Brand S soft drinks (or any other  Corporation B products), and Brand S soft drink advertisements and other  promotional materials make no reference to Brand W whiskey (or any other  corporation B products). For purposes of section 936(h), the advertising  and other promotional expenses for Brand W whiskey must be allocated  entirely to the gross income from sales of Brand W whiskey   and the advertising and other promotional expenses for Brand S soft  drink must be allocated entirely to the gross income from the sales of  soft drink extract, notwithstanding the fact that whiskey and soft drink  extract are both included in SIC code 208. A similar result would apply,  for example, to separately identifiable advertising and other marketing  expenses which relate specifically and exclusively to one or the other  of the following pairs of products: chewing gum and granulated sugar  (SIC code 206); canned tuna fish and freeze-dried coffee (SIC code 209);  children's underwear and ladies' brassieres (SIC code 234); aspirin  tablets and prescription antibiotic tablets (SIC code 283); floor wax  and perfume (SIC code 284); adhesives and inks (SIC code 289); semi- conductors and cathode-ray tubes (SIC code 367); batteries and extension  cords (SIC code 369); bandages and dental supplies (SIC code 384);  stainless steel flatware and jewelry parts (SIC code 391); children's  toys and sporting goods (SIC code 394); hair curlers and zippers (SIC  code 396); and paint brushes and linoleum tiles (SIC code 399).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 and that  possessions corporation A also manufactures aspirin, a non-prescription  product, for resale by its U.S. parent corporation, P. Further, assume  that the advertising and separately identifiable marketing expenses  which relate specifically and exclusively to aspirin sales total $100  and that these expenses are allocable solely to gross income derived  from aspirin sales. The sales method continues to be used to apportion  the marketing and distribution expenses related, directly or indirectly,  to products 1, 2, and 3, and the  apportionment of such expenses to product 1 for purposes of  determining combined taxable income from product 1 will remain  as stated in Example 1. None of the advertising and other separately  identifiable marketing expenses which relate specifically and  exclusively to aspirin will be taken into account in allocating and  apportioning the marketing and distribution expenses relating to the  gross income attributable to products 1, 2, and  3. Gross income attributable to aspirin will be considered as a  separate class of gross income, and all the advertising and separately  identifiable marketing expenses which relate specifically and  exclusively to aspirin sales of $100 will be allocated to the class of  gross income derived from aspirin sales. Similarly, none of the  marketing and distribution expenses, directly or indirectly, related  solely to the group of products 1, 2, and 3  will be taken into account in determining the combined taxable income  from aspirin sales. the remaining marketing and distribution expenses  which do not, directly or indirectly, relate solely to any specific  product or group of products (e.g., the salaries of a Vice-President of  Marketing who has responsibility for marketing all products and his  staff) shall be allocated and apportioned on the basis of the gross  receipts from the sales of all of the products (or a similar method) in  determining combined taxable income of any product.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: How may the allocation and apportionment of expenses to  combined gross income be verified?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: Substantiation of the allocation and apportionment of expenses  will be required upon audit of the possessions corporation and  affiliates. Detailed substantiation may be necessary, particularly where  the entities are engaged in multiple lines of business involving  distinct product areas. Sources of substantiation may include certified  financial reports. Form 10-K's, annual reports, internal production  reports, product line assembly work papers, and other relevant  materials. In this regard, see Sec. 1.861-8(f)(5).</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: Does section 936(h) override the moratorium provided by  section 223 of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and any subsequent  similar moratorium?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: Yes. Thus, the allocation and apportionment of product area  research described in question and answer 1 must be made without regard  to the moratorium.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: Is the cost of samples treated as a marketing expense?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: Yes. The cost of producing samples will be treated as a  marketing expense and not as inventoriable costs for purposes of  determining combined taxable income (and compliance with the significant  business presence test). However, for taxable years beginning prior to  January 1, 1986, the cost of producing samples may be treated as either  a marketing expense or as inventoriable costs.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 5: If a possessions corporation uses the profit split method to  determine its taxable income from sales of a product, how does it  determine its gross income for purposes of the 80-percent possession  source test and the 65-percent active trade or business test of section  936(a)(2)?</p><p class="depth0">A. 5: One-half of the deductions of the affiliated group (other than  foreign affiliates) which are used in determining the combined taxable  income from sales of the product are added to the   portion of the combined taxable income allocated to the possessions  corporation in order to determine the possessions corporation's gross  income from sales of such product.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 6: How will income from intangibles related to a possession  product be treated under the profit split method?</p><p class="depth0">A. 6: Combined taxable income of the possessions corporation and  affiliates from the sale of the possession product will include income  attributable to all intangibles, including both manufacturing and  marketing intangibles, associated with the product.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 7: Can a possessions corporation apply the profit split option to  a possession product if no U.S. affiliates derive income from the sale  of the possession product?</p><p class="depth0">A. 7: Yes.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 8: With respect to the factual situation discussed in question  and answer 7 how is combined taxable income computed?</p><p class="depth0">A. 8: The profit split option is applied to the taxable income of  the possessions corporation from sales of the possession product to  foreign affiliates and unrelated persons. Fifty percent of that income  is allocated to the possessions corporation, and the remainder is  allocated to the appropriate affiliates as described in question and  answer 13 of this paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Q. 9: May a possessions corporation compute its income under the  profit split method with respect to units of a possession product which  it sells to a U.S. affiliate if the U.S. affiliate leases such units to  unrelated persons or to foreign affiliates or uses such units in its own  trade or business?</p><p class="depth0">A. 9: Yes, provided that an independent sales price for the  possession product from comparable uncontrolled transactions can be  determined in accordance with Sec. 1.482-2 (e)(2). If, however, there is  a comparable uncontrolled price for an integrated product and the  possession product is a component product or end-product form thereof,  the possessions corporation may compute its income under the profit  split method with respect to such units. In either case, the possessions  corporation shall compute combined taxable income with respect to such  units under the following question and answer.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 10: If the possessions corporation is entitled to use the profit  split method in the situation described in Q. 9 (leasing units of the  possession product or use of such units in the taxpayer's own trade or  business), how should it compute combined taxable income with respect to  such units?</p><p class="depth0">A. 10: (i) Combined taxable income shall be computed as if the U.S.  affiliate had sold the units to an unrelated person (or to a foreign  affiliate) at the time the units were first leased or otherwise placed  in service by the U.S. affiliate. The sales price on such deemed sale  shall be equal to the independent sales price from comparable  uncontrolled transactions determined in accordance with Sec. 1.482- 2(e)(2), if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the possession product is a component product or an end- product form, the combined taxable income with respect to the possession  product shall be determined under Q&A.; 12 of this paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of determining the basis of a component product  or an end-product form, the deemed sales price of such product must be  determined. The deemed sales price of the component product shall be  determined by multiplying the deemed sales price of the integrated  product that includes the component product by a ratio, the numerator of  which is the production costs of the component product and the  denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product  that includes the component product. The deemed sales price of an end- product form shall be determined by multiplying the deemed sales price  of the integrated product that includes the end-product form by a ratio,  the numerator of which is the production costs of the end-product form  and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated  product that includes the end-product form. For the definition of  production costs, see Q&A.; 12 of this paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(A)</em> If combined taxable income is determined under paragraph (v)  of A. 12 of this paragraph (b)(1), in the case of a component product,  the deemed sales price shall be determined by using the actual sales  price of that product when   sold as an integrated product (as adjusted under the rules of the fourth  sentence of Sec. 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If combined taxable income is determined under paragraph (v) of  A. 12 of this paragraph (b)(1), in the case of an end-product form, the  deemed sales price shall be determined by subtracting from the deemed  sales price of the integrated product that includes the end-product form  (e.g., the leased property) the actual sales price of the excluded  component when sold as an integrated product to an unrelated person (as  adjusted under the rules of the fourth sentence of Sec. 1.482- 3(b)(2)(ii)(A)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The full amount of income received under the lease shall be  treated as income of (and be taxed to) the U.S. affiliate and not the  possessions corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 11: In the situation described in question 9, how does the U.S.  affiliate determine its basis in such units for purposes of computing  depreciation and similar items?</p><p class="depth0">A. 11: The U.S. affiliate shall be treated, for purposes of  computing its basis in such units, as if it had repurchased such units  immediately following the deemed sale and at the deemed sales price as  provided in Q&A.; 10 of this paragraph (b)(1).  The principles of questions and answers 10 and 11 are illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: Possessions corporation S manufactures 100 units of  possession product X.

The combined taxable income of integrated product A is  $400 per unit and the combined taxable income of product AB is $300 per  unit. The production cost ratio with respect to product A when sold as a  component of product AB, is 2/3. Unless the taxpayer elects and  satisfies the conditions of this paragraph (v), the combined taxable  income with respect to A will be $200 per unit (combined taxable income  for AB of $300 x the production cost ratio of 2/3). If, however, the  comparability standards of paragraph (v)(C) of this A. 12 are met, the  taxpayer may elect to determine combined taxable income of product A  when sold as a component of product AB using the same per unit combined  taxable income as product A   when sold as an integrated product.

Incomplete transactions will not be taken into consideration in  computing combined taxable income. Thus, for example, if in 1983, A, a  possessions corporation, sells units of a product with a cost to A of  $5000 to B corporation, its U.S. affiliate, which use the dollar-value  LIFO method of costing inventory, and B sells units with a cost of $4000  (representing A's cost) to C corporation, a foreign affiliate, only  $4000 of such costs shall be taken into consideration in computing the  combined taxable income of the possessions corporation and U.S.  affiliates for 1983. If a specific goods LIFO inventory method is used  by B, the determination of whether A's goods remain in B's inventory  shall be based on whether B's specific goods LIFO grouping has  experienced an increment or decrement for the year on the specific LIFO  cost of such units, rather than on an average unit cost of such units.  If the FIFO method of costing inventory is used by B, transfers may be  based on the cost of the specific units transferred or on the average  unit production cost of the units transferred, but in each case a FIFO  flow assumption shall be used to identify the units transferred. For a  determination of which goods are sold by taxpayers using the LIFO  method, see question and answer 19.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 16: If a possessions corporation purchases materials from an  affiliate and computes combined taxable income for a possession product  which includes such materials, how are those materials to be treated in  the possessions corporation's inventory?</p><p class="depth0">A. 16: The cost of those materials is considered to be equal to the  affiliate's cost using the affiliate's method of costing inventory.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 17: If the possessions corporation uses the FIFO method of  costing inventory and the U.S. affiliate uses the LIFO method of costing  inventory, or vice versa, what method of costing inventory should be  used in computing combined taxable income?</p><p class="depth0">A. 17: The transferor corporation's method of costing inventory  determines the cost of inventory for purposes of combined taxable income  while the transferee corporation's method of costing inventory  determines the flow. Assume, for example, that X corporation, a  possessions corporation, using the FIFO method of costing inventory  purchases materials from Y corporation, U.S. affiliate, also using the  FIFO method. X corporation produces a product which it transfers to Z  corporation, another U.S. affiliate using the LIFO method. Assume also  that the final product satisfies the significant business presence test.  Under the facts, the cost of the materials purchased by X from Y is Y's  FIFO cost. The costs of the inventory transferred by X to Z are  determined under X's FIFO method of accounting as is the flow of the  inventory from X to Z. The costs added by Z are determined under Z's  LIFO method of inventory, as is the flow of the inventory from Z to  unrelated persons or foreign affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 18: How are the costs of a possession product and the revenues  derived from the sale of a possession product determined if the U.S.  affiliate includes purchases of the possessions product in a dollar- value LIFO inventory pool (as provided under Sec. 1.472-8)?</p><p class="depth0">A. 18: The following method will be accepted in determining the  revenues derived from the sale of a possession product and the costs of  a possession product if the U.S. affiliate includes purchases of the  possession product in a dollar-value LIFO inventory pool. The rules  apply solely for the cost sharing and profit split options under section  936(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Revenue identification. The identification of revenues derived  from sales of a possession product must generally be made on a specific  identification basis. The particular method employed by a taxpayer for  valuing its inventory   will have no impact on the determination of what units are sold or how  much revenue is derived from such sales. Thus, if a U.S. affiliate sells  both item A (a possession product) and item B (a non-possession  product), the actual sales revenues received by the U.S. affiliate from  item A sales would constitute possession product revenue for purposes of  the profit split option and possession sales for purposes of the cost  sharing option regardless of whether the U.S. affiliate values its  inventories on the FIFO or the LIFO method. In instances where sales of  item A (i.e., the possession product) cannot be determined by use of  specific identification (for example, in cases where items A and B are  identical except that one is produced in the possession (item A) and the  other (item B) is produced outside of the possession and it is not  possible to segregate these items in the hands of the U.S. affiliate),  it will be necessary to identify the portion of the combined sales of  items A and B (which together can be identified on a specific  identification basis) which is attributed to item A sales and the  portion which is attributed to item B sales. The determination of the  portion of aggregated sales attributable to item A and item B is  independent of the LIFO method used to determine the cost of such sales  and may be made under the following approach. A taxpayer may, for  purposes of this section of the regulations, use the relative purchases  (in units) of items A and B by the U.S. affiliate during the taxable  year (or other appropriate measuring period such as the period during  the taxable year used to determine current-year costs, i.e., earliest  acquisitions period, latest acquisitions period, etc.) in determining  the ratio to apply against the combined items A and B sales revenue. If  the sales exceed current purchases, the taxpayer can use a FIFO unit  approach which identifies actual unit sales on a first-in, first-out  basis. Revenue determination where specific identification is not  possible is illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. At the end of year 1, there are 600 units of combined items  A and B which are to be allocated between A and B on the basis of annual  purchases of A and B units during year 1. During year 1, 1,000 units of  item A, a possession product, and 2,000 units of item B, a non- possession product, were purchased. Thus, the 600 units in year 1 ending  inventory are allocated 200 (i.e. \1/3\) to item A units and 400 (i.e.  \2/3\) to item B units based on the relative purchases of A (1,000) and  B (2,000) in year 1. These units appear as beginning inventory in year  2.</p><p class="depth0">In year 2, 1,500 units of item A are purchased and 1,500 units of  item B are purchased. However, 3,300 units of items A and B in the  aggregate are sold for $600,000. The relative proportion of the $600,000  attributable to item A and to item B sales would be determined as  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 2 sales                        Item A  Item B ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Unit sales from opening inventory.......................     200     400 Unit sale from current-year purchases...................   1,350   1,350</p><p class="depth0">---------------</p><p class="depth0">Total unit sales (3,300)............................   1,550   1,750</p><p class="depth0">Percentage..........................................      47      53 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.144</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 2 Closing Inventory                       Units ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Item A..........................................................     150 Item B..........................................................     150 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Thus, revenues from Item A sales for purposes of computing possession  sales for the cost sharing option and revenues for the profit split  option are $281,818.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cost identification. The determination of the cost of  possession product sales by the U.S. affiliate must be based on the LIFO  inventory method of the U.S. affiliate. The LIFO cost of possession  product sales will, for purposes   of this section of the regulations, be determined by maintaining a  separate LIFO cost for possession products in a taxpayer's opening and  closing LIFO inventory and using this cost to calculate an independent  cost of possession product sales. This separate LIFO cost for possession  products in the LIFO pool of a taxpayer is to be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determine the base-year cost of possession products in ending  inventory in a LIFO pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determine the percentage of the base-year cost of possession  products in the pool as compared to the total base-year cost of all  items in the pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Multiply the percentage determined in step (B) of this  subdivision (ii) by the ending LIFO inventory value of the pool to  determine the deemed LIFO cost attributable to possession products in  the pool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Subtract the LIFO cost of possession products in ending  inventory in the pool (as calculated in step (C) of this subdivision  (ii)) from the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Possession product purchases for the year, plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The portion of the opening LIFO inventory value of the pool  attributed to possession products (i.e., the result obtained in step (C)  of this subdivision (ii) for the prior year).  The number determined by this calculation is the LIFO cost of possession  product sales from the taxpayer's LIFO pool.</p><p class="depth0">Example: Assume that item A is a possession product and item B is a  non-possession product and also assume the inventory and purchases with  respect to the LIFO pool as provided below:</p><p class="depth0">Year 1--Ending Inventory ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">No. of   Base-year  Base-year</p><p class="depth0">units    cost/unit     cost     Percent ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Item A......................        100      $2.00       $200         20 Item B......................        200       4.00        800         80 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 1--LIFO Value ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Base-year</p><p class="depth0">cost      Index    LIFO cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Increment layer 2......................       $300        3.0       $900 Increment layer 1......................        400        2.0        800 Base layer.............................        300        1.0        300</p><p class="depth0">-----------           ----------</p><p class="depth0">Pool total.......................     $1,000  .........     $2,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 1--LIFO Value Per Item ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Base-year     LIFO</p><p class="depth0">cost      value ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total pool..................................     $1,000     $2,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------------- Item A............................................        200        400 Item B............................................        800      1,600 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 2--Purchases ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total</p><p class="depth0">purchases ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Item A.......................................................     $6,000 Item B.......................................................      4,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 2--Ending Inventory ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">No. of   Base-year  Base-year</p><p class="depth0">units    cost/unit     cost     Percent ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Item A......................        200      $2.00       $400         50 Item B......................        100       4.00        400         50 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 2--LIFO Value ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Base-year</p><p class="depth0">cost      Index    LIFO cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Increment layer 2......................       $100        3.0       $300 Increment layer 1......................        400        2.0        800 Base layer.............................       $300        1.0        300</p><p class="depth0">-----------           ---------- Pool total.............................        800  .........      1,400 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The year 2 LIFO cost of possession product A sales will be calculated as</p><p class="depth0">follows: (1) Base-year cost of item in year 2 ending inventory=$400 (2) Percentage of item A base-year cost to total base-year cost ($400 /</p><p class="depth0">$800) = 50% (3) LIFO value of item A ($1,400 x 50%) = $700 (4) LIFO cost of item A sales is determined by adding to the beginning</p><p class="depth0">inventory in year 2 the purchases of item A in year 2 and subtracting</p><p class="depth0">from this amount the ending inventory in year 2 ($400 + $6000 - $700 =</p><p class="depth0">$5700).

Thus, the opening  inventory for the first year   for which section 936(h) applies (valuing possession products purchased  from the possessions corporation on the basis of the cost of such  possession products), would equal the new base year cost of the  inventory of such pool of the U.S. affiliate. Increments and decrements  at new base year cost would be valued for LIFO purposes pursuant to the  procedures provided by regulations under section 472.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 20: If the possessions corporation computes its income with  respect to a product under the profit split method, with respect to  which units of the product shall the profit split method apply?</p><p class="depth0">A. 20: The profit split method shall apply to units of the  possession product produced in whole or in part by the possessions  corporation in the possession and sold during the taxable year by  members of the affiliated group (other than foreign affiliates) to  unrelated parties or to foreign affiliates. In no event shall the profit  split method apply to units of the product which were not taken into  account by the possessions corporation in applying the significant  business presence test for the current taxable year or for any prior  taxable year in which the possessions corporation also had a significant  business presence in the possession with respect to such product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pre-TEFRA inventory.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: How is pre-TEFRA inventory to be determined if the profit  split option is elected and the FIFO method of costing inventory is used  by the U.S. affiliate?</p><p class="depth0">A. 1: Pre-TEFRA inventory is inventory which was produced by the  possessions corporation and transferred to a U.S. affiliate prior to the  possessions corporation's first taxable year beginning after December  31, 1982. Pre-TEFRA inventory will not be included for purposes of the  profit split option. If the U.S. affiliate uses the FIFO method of  costing inventory, the pre-TEFRA inventory will be treated as the first  inventory sold by the U.S. affiliate during the first year in which  section 936(h) applies and will not be included in the computation of  combined taxable income for purposes of the profit split option. The  treatment of pre-TEFRA inventory when FIFO costing is used by both the  U.S. affiliate and the possessions corporation is illustrated by the  following example in which FIFO unit costing is used:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume the following:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">X                 Y</p><p class="depth0">-----------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Possessions     U.S. affiliate</p><p class="depth0">corporation   -----------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------</p><p class="depth0">Number    Cost    Number    Cost</p><p class="depth0">of      per       of      per</p><p class="depth0">units     unit    units     unit ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Beginning inventory.................      500     $150      200     $225 Units produced during 1983..........    1,000      200 Ending inventory....................      400      200      300  ....... ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">In 1983, the beginning inventory of X, a possessions corporation, is  500 units with a unit cost of $150 and the beginning inventory of Y, the  U.S. affiliate, is 200 units with a unit cost of $225, which represents  the section 482 price paid by Y. Y's beginning inventory in 1983  represents purchases made in 1982 of products produced by X in that  year. Y sells all the units it purchases from X to Z, a foreign  affiliate. In 1983, X produces 1000 units at a unit cost of $200 and  sells 1100 units to Y (the difference between 1500 units, representing  X's 1983 beginning inventory (500) and the units produced by X in 1983  (1000), and X's ending inventory of 400 units). Of the 1100 units sold  by X to Y in 1983 only 800 units (and not 1000 units) which were sold by  Y to Z are taken into consideration in computing combined taxable income  for 1983. Since FIFO costing by the possessions corporation is used, the  cost is $150 per unit for the first 500 units and $200 per unit for the  remaining 300 units. The 200 units sold by X to Y in 1982 are pre-TEFRA  inventory and are not included in the computation of combined taxable  income for 1983. They are also treated as the first units sold by Y to Z  in 1983. This inventory has a unit cost of $225, which reflects the  section 482 transfer price from X to Y in 1982. Y's 1983 ending  inventory of 300 units will not be taken into consideration in computing  the combined taxable income of X and Y for 1983 because the units have  not been sold to a foreign affiliate or to persons who are not members  of the affiliated group. In a subsequent year when the units are sold to  Z, the cost to X and selling price to Z of these units will enter into  the computation of combined taxable income for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Covered Intangibles.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 1: What are ``covered intangibles'' under section  936(h)(5)(C)(i)(II)?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> intangible property  developed in a possession solely by the possessions corporation and  owned by it, (2) manufacturing intangible property   (described in section 936(h)(3)(B)(i)) which is acquired by the  possessions corporation from unrelated persons, and (3) any other  intangible property (described in section 936(h)(3)(B) (ii) through (v),  to the extent not described in section 936(h)(3)(B)(i)) which relates to  sales of products or services to unrelated persons for ultimate  consumption or use in the possession in which the possessions  corporation conducts its business. The possessions corporation is  treated as the owner of covered intangibles for purposes of obtaining a  return thereon.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 2: Do covered intangibles include manufacturing intangible  property which is acquired by an affiliate and subsequently transferred  to the possessions corporation?</p><p class="depth0">A. 2: No. In order for a manufacturing intangible to be treated as a  covered intangible, the intangible property must be acquired directly by  the possessions corporation from an unrelated person unless the  manufacturing intangible was acquired by an affiliate from an unrelated  person and was transferred to the possessions corporation by the  affiliate prior to September 3, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 3: If a possessions corporation licenses a manufacturing  intangible from an unrelated party, will the licensed intangible be  treated as a covered intangible?</p><p class="depth0">A. 3: No.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 4: How is ultimate consumption or use determined for purposes of  the definition of covered intangibles?</p><p class="depth0">A. 4: A product will be treated as having its ultimate use or  consumption in a possession if it is sold by the possessions corporation  to a related or unrelated person in a possession and is not resold or  used or consumed outside of the possession within one year after the  date of the sale.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 5: Are sales of products that relate to covered intangibles  excluded from the cost sharing fraction?</p><p class="depth0">A. 5: If no manufacturing intangibles other than covered intangibles  are associated with the possession product, then sales of such product  will be excluded from the cost sharing fraction. If both covered and  non-covered manufacturing intangibles are associated with the possession  product, then sales of such product will be included in the cost sharing  fraction.</p><p class="depth0">Q. 6: If the cost sharing option is elected, is it necessary for the  possessions corporation to be the legal owner of covered intangibles  described in section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(II)(c) related to the product in  order for the possessions corporation to receive a full return with  respect to such intangibles?</p><p class="depth0">A. 6: No. For purposes of section 936(h), it is immaterial whether  such covered intangibles are owned by the possessions corporation or by  another member of the affiliated group. Moreover, if the legal owner of  such covered intangibles which are subject to section 936(h)(5) is an  affiliate of the possessions corporation, such person will not be  required to charge an arm's-length royalty under section 482 to the  possessions corporation.
