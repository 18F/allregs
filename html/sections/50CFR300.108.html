                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting vessel assigned an IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is visible from an enforcement or inspection vessel, and on an appropriate weather deck so that it is visible from the air.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operator of each harvesting vessel not assigned an IRCS, such as a small trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of trawlers, must display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a numerical suffix specific for the non-assigned vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the background and must be permanently affixed to the harvesting vessel in block roman alphabet letters and arabic numerals at least 1 m in height for harvesting vessels over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height for all other harvesting vessels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Navigational lights and shapes. Each harvesting vessel must display the lights and shapes prescribed by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 amendment TIAS 10672), for the activity in which the harvesting vessel is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 81).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Gear identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting vessel must ensure that all deployed fishing gear that is not physically and continuously attached to a harvesting vessel is clearly marked at the surface with a buoy displaying the vessel identification of the harvesting vessel (see paragraph (a) of this section) to which the gear belongs, a light visible for 2 miles at night in good visibility, and a radio buoy. Trawl codends passed from one vessel to another are considered continuously attached gear and do not have to be marked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operator of each harvesting vessel must ensure that deployed longlines, strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the surface at each terminal end with a buoy displaying the vessel identification of the harvesting vessel to which the gear belongs (see paragraph (a) of this section), a light visible for 2 miles at night in good visibility, and a radio buoy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance. The operator of each harvesting vessel must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in good repair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that nothing on the harvesting vessel obstructs the view of the markings from an enforcement or inspection vessel or aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are displayed for the harvesting vessel's activity and are properly functioning.</p>
