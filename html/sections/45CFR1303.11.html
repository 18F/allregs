                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After receiving concurrence from the Commissioner, ACYF, the responsible HHS official may suspend financial assistance to a grantee in whole or in part for breach or threatened breach of any requirement stated in Sec. 1303.10 pursuant to notice and opportunity to show cause why assistance should not be suspended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The responsible HHS official will notify the grantee as required by Sec. 1303.5 or by telegram that ACYF intends to suspend financial assistance, in whole or in part, unless good cause is shown why such action should not be taken. The notice will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The grounds for the proposed suspension;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of the proposed suspension;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information that the grantee has the opportunity to submit written material in opposition to the intended suspension and to meet informally with the responsible HHS official regarding the intended suspension;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information that the written material must be submitted to the responsible HHS official at least seven days prior to the effective date of the proposed suspension and that a request for an informal meeting must be made in writing to the responsible HHS official no later than seven days after the day the notice of intention to suspend was mailed to the grantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Invitation to correct the deficiency by voluntary action; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A copy of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the grantee requests an informal meeting, the responsible HHS official will fix a time and place for the meeting. In no event will such meeting be scheduled less than seven days after the notice of intention to suspend was sent to the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The responsible HHS official may at his or her discretion extend the period of time or date for making requests or submitting material by the grantee and will notify the grantee of any such extension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> At the time the responsible HHS official sends the notice of intention to suspend financial assistance to the grantee, the official will send a copy of it to any delegate agency whose activities or failures to act are a substantial cause of the proposed suspension, and will inform such delegate agency that it is entitled to submit written material in opposition and to participate in the informal meeting with the responsible HHS official if one is held. In addition, the responsible HHS official may give such notice to any other Head Start delegate agency of the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Within three days of receipt of the notice of intention to suspend financial assistance, the grantee shall send a copy of such notice and a copy of this subpart to all delegate agencies which would be financially affected by the proposed suspension action. Any delegate agency that wishes to submit written material may do so within the time stated in the notice. Any delegate agency that wishes to participate in the informal meeting regarding the intended suspension, if not otherwise afforded a right to participate, may request permission to do so from the responsible HHS official, who may grant or deny such permission. In acting upon any such request from a delegate agency, the responsible HHS official will take into account the effect of the proposed suspension on the particular delegate agency, the extent to which the meeting would become unduly complicated as a result of granting such permission, and the extent to which the interests of the delegate agency requesting such permission appear to be adequately represented by other participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The responsible HHS official will consider any timely material presented in writing, any material presented during the course of the informal meeting as well as any showing that the grantee has adequately corrected the deficiency which led to the suspension proceedings. The decision of the responsible HHS official will be made within five days after the conclusion of the informal meeting, or, if no informal meeting is held, within five days of receipt by the responsible HHS official of written material from all concerned parties. If the responsible HHS official concludes that the grantee has failed to show cause why financial assistance should not be suspended, the official may suspend financial assistance in whole or in part and under such terms and conditions as he or she specifies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice of such suspension will be promptly transmitted to the grantee as required in Sec. 1303.5 of this part or by some other means showing the date of receipt, and shall become effective upon delivery or on the date delivery is refused or the material is returned. Suspension shall not exceed 30 days unless the responsible HHS official and the grantee agree to a continuation of the suspension for an additional period of time. If termination proceedings are initiated in accordance with Sec. 1303.14, the suspension of financial assistance will be rescinded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> New obligations incurred by the grantee during the suspension period will be not be allowed unless the granting agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or an amendment to it. Necessary and otherwise allowable costs which the grantee could not reasonably avoid during the suspension period will be allowed if they result from obligations properly incurred by the grantee before the effective date of the suspension and not in anticipation of suspension or termination. At the discretion of the granting agency, third-party in-kind contributions applicable to the suspension period may be allowed in satisfaction of cost sharing or matching requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The responsible HHS official may appoint an agency to serve as an interim grantee to operate the program until the grantee's suspension is lifted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The responsible HHS official may modify the terms, conditions and nature of the suspension or rescind the suspension action at any time on his or her own initiative or upon a satisfactory showing that the grantee has adequately corrected the deficiency which led to the suspension and that repetition is not threatened. Suspension partly or fully rescinded may, at the discretion of the responsible HHS official, be reimposed with or without further proceedings, except that the total time of suspension may not exceed 30 days unless termination proceedings are initiated in accordance with Sec. 1303.14 or unless the responsible HHS official and the grantee agree to continuation of the suspension for an additional period of time. If termination proceedings are initiated, the suspension of financial assistance will be rescinded.</p>
