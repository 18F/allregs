Due to the  need for expediting the modifications, the revised map is already in  effect and the appeal period commences on or about the effective date of  the modified map. An interim rule, followed by a final rule, will list  the revised map effective date, local repository and the name and  address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community. The map(s) is  (are) effective for both flood plain management and insurance purposes.  [51 FR 30317, Aug. 25, 1986.
