                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overview. This section describes the verification procedure for roll runout and roll diameter. Roll runout is a measure of the variation in roll radius around the circumference of the roll.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope and frequency. Perform these verifications upon initial installation and after major maintenance that could affect roll surface finish or dimensions (such as resurfacing or polishing).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Roll runout procedure. Verify roll runout based on the following procedure, or an equivalent procedure based on good engineering judgment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform this verification with laboratory and dynamometer temperatures stable and at equilibrium. Release the roll brake and shut off power to the dynamometer. Remove any dirt, rubber, rust, and debris from the roll surface. Mark measurement locations on the roll surface using a marker. Mark the roll at a minimum of four equally spaced locations across the roll width; we recommend taking measurements every 150 mm across the roll. Secure the marker to the deck plate adjacent to the roll surface and slowly rotate the roll to mark a clear line around the roll circumference. Repeat this process for all measurement locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure roll runout using an indicator with a probe that allows for measuring the position of the roll surface relative to the roll centerline as it turns through a complete revolution. The indicator must have some means of being securely mounted adjacent to the roll. The indicator must have sufficient range to measure roll runout at all points, with a minimum accuracy of 0.025 mm. Calibrate the indicator according to the instrument manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Position the indicator adjacent to the roll surface at the desired measurement location. Position the shaft of the indicator perpendicular to the roll such that the point of the indicator is slightly touching the surface of the roll and can move freely through a full rotation of the roll. Zero the indicator according to the instrument manufacturer's instructions. Avoid distortion of the runout measurement from the weight of a person standing on or near the mounted dial indicator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Slowly turn the roll through a complete rotation and record the maximum and minimum values from the indicator. Calculate runout as the difference between these maximum and minimum values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section for all measurement locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The roll runout must be less than 0.254 mm (0.0100 inches) at all measurement locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diameter procedure. Verify roll diameter based on the following procedure, or an equivalent procedure based on good engineering judgment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prepare the laboratory and the dynamometer as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure roll diameter using a Pi Tape[supreg]. Orient the Pi Tape[supreg] to the marker line at the desired measurement location with the Pi Tape[supreg] hook pointed outward. Temporarily secure the Pi Tape[supreg] to the roll near the hook end with adhesive tape. Slowly turn the roll, wrapping the Pi Tape[supreg] around the roll surface. Ensure that the Pi Tape[supreg] is flat and adjacent to the marker line around the full circumference of the roll. Attach a 2.26-kg weight to the hook of the Pi Tape[supreg] and position the roll so that the weight dangles freely. Remove the adhesive tape without disturbing the orientation or alignment of the Pi Tape[supreg].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Overlap the gage member and the vernier scale ends of the Pi Tape[supreg] to read the diameter measurement to the nearest 0.01 mm. Follow the manufacturer's recommendation to correct the measurement to 20 [deg]C, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Repeat the steps in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section for all measurement locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The measured roll diameter must be within 0.254 mm of the specified nominal value at all measurement locations. You may revise the nominal value to meet this specification, as long as you use the corrected nominal value for all calculations in this subpart.</p>
