                                Sec. 75.342  Monitoring and reporting program performance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring by the non-Federal entity. The non-Federal entity is responsible for oversight of the operations of the Federal award supported activities. The non-Federal entity must monitor its activities under Federal awards to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and performance expectations are being achieved. Monitoring by the non-Federal entity must cover each program, function or activity. See also Sec. 75.352.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-construction performance reports. The HHS awarding agency must use standard, OMB-approved data elements for collection of performance information (including performance progress reports, Research Performance Progress Report, or such future collections as may be approved by OMB and listed on the OMB Web site).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The non-Federal entity must submit performance reports at the interval required by the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity to best inform improvements in program outcomes and productivity. Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances, for example where more frequent reporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the Federal award or could significantly affect program outcomes. Annual reports must be due 90 calendar days after the reporting period; quarterly or semiannual reports must be due 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year Federal awards. The final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the period of performance end date. If a justified request is submitted by a non-Federal entity, the HHS awarding agency may extend the due date for any performance report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The non-Federal entity must submit performance reports using OMB-approved government-wide standard information collections when providing performance information. As appropriate in accordance with the above-mentioned information collections, these reports will contain, for each Federal award, brief information on the following unless other collections are approved by OMB:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the period. Where the accomplishments of the Federal award can be quantified, a computation of the cost (for example, related to units of accomplishment) may be required if that information will be useful. Where performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the HHS awarding agency program, the HHS awarding agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Construction performance reports. For the most part, onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data are relied on heavily by HHS awarding agencies and pass-through entities to monitor progress under Federal awards and subawards for construction. The HHS awarding

agency may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates that have significant impact upon the supported activity. In such cases, the non-Federal entity must inform the HHS awarding agency or pass-through entity as soon as the following types of conditions become known:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the Federal award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more or different beneficial results than originally planned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The HHS awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The HHS awarding agency may waive any performance report required by this part if not needed.</p>
