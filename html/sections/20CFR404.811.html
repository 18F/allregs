After receiving a request for a statement of earnings and the information we need to comply with the request, we will provide you or your authorized representative a statement of the earnings we have credited to your record at the time of your request. With the statement of earnings, we will include estimates of the benefits potentially payable on your record, unless you do not have the required credits (quarters of coverage) for any kind of benefit(s). (However, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section regarding the possibility of our estimating up to eight additional credits on your record.) If we do not provide a statement of earnings and an estimate of all the benefits potentially payable, or any other information you requested, we will explain why.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of statement of earnings and benefit estimates. The statement of your earnings and benefit estimates will contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Your social security taxed earnings as shown by our records as of the date of your request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An estimate of the social security and medicare hospital insurance taxes paid on your earnings (although we do not maintain such tax information);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of credits, i.e., quarters of coverage, not exceeding 40, you have for both social security and medicare hospital insurance purposes, and the number you need to be eligible for social security and also for medicare hospital insurance coverage. If you do not already have the required credits (quarters of coverage) to be eligible to receive social security benefits and medicare hospital insurance coverage, we may include up to eight additional estimated credits (four per year) based on the earnings you told us you had for last year and this year that we have not yet entered on your record;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement as to whether you meet the credits (quarters of coverage) requirements, as described in subpart B of this part, for each type of social security benefit when we prepare the benefit estimates, and also whether you are eligible for medicare hospital insurance coverage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Estimates of the monthly retirement (old-age), disability, dependents' and survivors' insurance benefits potentially payable on your record if you meet the credits (quarters of coverage) requirements.
