                                Sec. 1000.224  Can any part of the IHP be waived?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes. HUD has general authority under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA to waive any IHP requirements when an Indian tribe cannot comply with IHP requirements due to exigent circumstances beyond its control, for a period of not more than 90 days. The waiver authority under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA provides flexibility to address the needs of every Indian tribe, including small Indian tribes. The waiver may be requested by the Indian tribe or its TDHE (if such authority is delegated by the Indian tribe), and such waiver shall not be unreasonably withheld.
