Under section 103(e)(2) of the Act, if the aggregate insured losses exceed $100,000,000,000 during any Program Year, the Secretary shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000, and no insurer that has met its insurer deductible shall be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other requirements. As a condition for federal payments under section 103(b) of the Act, in the case of any policy that is issued after December 26, 2007, an insurer must provide clear and conspicuous disclosure to the policyholder of the existence of the $100,000,000,000 cap under section 103(e)(2). The cap disclosure must be made at the time of offer, purchase, and renewal of the policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstration of compliance. For policies issued after December 26, 2007, if an insurer does not provide a cap disclosure by the time of the first offer, purchase or renewal of the policy after December 26, 2007, then the insurer must be able to demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it has provided the disclosure as soon as possible following December 26, 2007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other applicable rules. The rules in Sec. 50.12(a), (c), (d), (e)(1), and (f) (relating to clear and conspicuous disclosure) and in Sec. 50.13 (relating to offer, purchase, and renewal) apply to the cap disclosure.
