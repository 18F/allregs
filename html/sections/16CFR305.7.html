The capacity shall be the total refrigerated volume (VT) and the adjusted total volume (AV) in cubic feet, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cubic foot, as determined according to appendix A to 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Freezers. The capacity shall be the total refrigerated volume (VT) and the adjusted total volume (AV) in cubic feet, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cubic foot, as determined according to appendix B to 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dishwashers. The capacity shall be the place-setting capacity, determined according to appendix C to 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Water heaters. The capacity shall be the first hour rating (for storage-type models) and gallons per minute (for instantaneous-type models), as determined according to appendix E to 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pool heaters. The capacity shall be the heating capacity in Btu's per hour, rounded to the nearest 1,000 Btu's per hour, as determined according to appendix P to 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Room air conditioners. The capacity shall be the cooling capacity in Btu's per hour, as determined according to appendix F to 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, but rounded to the nearest value ending in hundreds that will satisfy the relationship that the value of EER used in representations equals the rounded value of capacity divided by the value of input power in watts. If a value ending in hundreds will not satisfy this relationship, the capacity may be rounded to the nearest value ending in 50 that will.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Clothes washers. The capacity shall be the tub capacity as determined according to Department of Energy test procedures in 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, in the terms ``standard'' or ``compact'' as defined in appendix J1 to 10 CFR part 430. For models manufactured after March 7, 2015, the capacity shall be the tub capacity as determined according to Department of Energy test procedures in 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, expressed in terms of ``Capacity (tub volume)'' in cubic feet, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cubic foot, and the capacity class designations ``standard'' or ``compact.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Furnaces.
