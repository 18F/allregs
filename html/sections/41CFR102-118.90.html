                            <p class="depth0">is this subject to prepayment audit?</p><p class="depth0">Generally, no transportation or transportation services ordered with  a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation  can be prepayment audited because the bank or charge card contractor  pays the TSP directly, before your agency receives a bill that can be  audited from the charge card company. However, if your agency contracts  with the charge card or charge account provider to provide for a  prepayment audit, then, as long as your agency is not liable for paying  the bank for improper charges (as determined by the prepayment audit  verification process), a prepayment audit can be used. As with all  prepayment audit programs, the charge card prepayment audit must be  approved by the GSA Audit Division prior to implementation. If the  charge card contract does not provide for a prepayment audit, your  agency must submit the transportation line items on the charge card to  the GSA Audit Division for a postpayment audit.</p>
