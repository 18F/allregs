The Director of the  Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance  with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Garments in girls'  and boys' sizes smaller than Large (L), including Extra-Small (XS),  Small (S), and Medium (M), are equivalent to sizes smaller than size 12.  The fact that an item of children's upper outerwear with a hood and neck  drawstring is labeled as being larger than a size Large (L) does not  necessarily mean that the item is not equivalent to a size in the range  of 2T to 12.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Garments in girls' size Extra-Large (XL) and boys' size Extra- Large (XL) are equivalent to size 16. The fact that an item of  children's upper outerwear with a waist or bottom drawstring is labeled  as being larger than size Extra-Large (XL) does not necessarily mean  that the item is not equivalent to a size in the range of 2T to 16.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In cases where garment labels give a range of sizes, if the  range includes any size that is subject to a requirement in ASTM F 1816- 97, the garment will be considered subject, even if other sizes in the  stated range, taken alone, would not be subject to the requirement. For  example, a coat sized 12 through 14 remains subject to the prohibition  of hood and neck area drawstrings, even though this requirement of ASTM  F 1816-97 only applies to garments up to size 12. A coat size 13 through  15 would not be considered within the scope of ASTM F 1816-97's  prohibition of neck and hood drawstrings, but would be subject to the  requirements for waist or bottom drawstrings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To fall within the scope of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through  (2)(iii) of this section, a garment need not state anywhere on it, or on  its tags, labels, package, or any other materials accompanying it, the  term ``girls,'' the term ``boys,'' or whether the garment is designed or  intended for girls or boys.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Commission may use any other evidence that would tend to  show that an item of children's upper outerwear is a size that is  equivalent to sizes 2T to 16.
