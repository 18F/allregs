This procedure cannot be a substitute for Federal Register publication;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The fact that a meeting may be closed to the public under the exemptions of the Government in the Sunshine Act does not relieve GSA of the requirement to publish a notice of it in the Federal Register. The Administrator may authorize an exception to this requirement for reasons of national security if the HSSO requests it at least 30 calendar days before the meeting, with the concurrence of the General Counsel of designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> An advisory committee meeting is not open to the public, nor is the attendance, appearance, or filing of statements by interested persons permitted, if the Administrator decides that the meeting is exempted under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b (c)) and there is sufficient reason to invoke the exemption. If only part of the meeting concerns exempted matters, only that part is closed. The HSSO or Regional Administrator submits any decisions concerning the closing of meetings in writing to the Administrator for approval at least 30 calendar days in advance of the meeting. These decisions clearly set forth the reasons for doing so, citing the specific exemptions used from the Government in the Sunshine Act in the meeting notice published in the Federal Register. They are made available to the public on request. The Administrator may waive the 30-day requirement when a lesser period of time is requested and adequately justified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> If any meeting or portion of a meeting is closed to public attendance, the advisory committee issues a report at lease annually setting forth a summary of its activities and such related matters as would be informative to the public, consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Notice of the availability of the report and instructions on how to gain access to it are published in the Federal Register no later than 60 days after its completion. In addition, copies of the report are filed with the Library of Congress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The General Counsel reviews all requests to close meetings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The HSSO or Regional Administrator publishes the meeting notices in the Federal Register, including the reasons why all or part of the meeting is closed, citing the specified exemptions used from the Government in the Sunshine Act.</p>
