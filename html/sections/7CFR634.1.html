The proposed project area must be within a high priority area in an approved agricultural portion of a 208 water quality management plan. Participation in RCWP is voluntary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The program is a new USDA program and an extension of existing water-quality management programs of EPA.</p>
