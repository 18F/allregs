                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner of the flock or his or her agent must identify all  animals 1 year of age or over within the flock. All animals less than 1  year of age must be identified when a change of ownership occurs, with  the exception of those animals under 1 year of age moving within  slaughter channels that must be identified in accordance with Sec. Sec.  79.2 and 79.3 of this chapter. The form of identification must be an  electronic implant, flank tattoo, ear tattoo, or tamper-resistant ear  tag approved for this use by APHIS. In the case of goats, the form of  identification may alternatively be a tail fold tattoo. The official  identification must provide a unique identification number that is  applied by the owner of the flock or his or her agent and must be linked  to that flock in the National Scrapie Database.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon request by a State or APHIS representative, the owner of  the flock or his or her agent must have an accredited veterinarian  collect tissues from animals for scrapie diagnostic purposes and submit  them to a laboratory designated by a State or APHIS representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon request by a State or APHIS representative, the owner of  the flock or his or her agent must make animals in the flock and the  records required to be kept as a part of these plans available for  inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner of the flock or his or her agent must meet  requirements found necessary by a State or APHIS representative to  monitor for scrapie and to prevent the recurrence of scrapie in the  flock and to prevent the spread of scrapie from the flock. These other  requirements may include, but are not limited to: Utilization of a live- animal screening test; restrictions on the animals that may be moved  from the flock; segregated lambing; cleaning and disinfection of lambing  facilities; and/or education of the owner of the flock and personnel  working with the flock in techniques to recognize clinical signs of  scrapie and to control the spread of scrapie.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner of the flock or his or her agent must immediately  report the following animals to a State representative, APHIS  representative, or an accredited veterinarian, and not remove them from  a flock without written permission of a State or APHIS representative:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any sheep or goat exhibiting weight loss despite retention of  appetite; behavioral abnormalities; pruritus (itching); wool pulling;  biting at legs or side; lip smacking; motor abnormalities such as  incoordination, high stepping gait of forelimbs, bunny hop movement of  rear legs, swaying of back end; increased sensitivity to noise and  sudden movement; tremor, ``star gazing,'' head pressing, recumbency, or  other signs of neurological disease or chronic wasting illness; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any sheep or goat in the flock that has tested positive for  scrapie or for the proteinase resistant protein associated with scrapie  on a live-animal screening test or any other test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for flock plans only. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An epidemiologic  investigation must be conducted to identify high-risk and exposed  animals that currently reside in the flock or that previously resided in  the flock, and all high-risk animals, scrapie-positive animals, and  suspect animals must be removed from the flock. The animals must be  removed either by movement to an approved research facility or by  euthanization and disposal of the carcasses by burial, incineration, or  other methods in accordance with local, State, and Federal laws, or, in  the case   of high-risk animals, by movement to slaughter in accordance with the  provisions of part 79 of this chapter, or upon request in individual  cases by another means determined by the Administrator to be sufficient  to prevent the spread of scrapie;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The premises of a flock under a flock plan must be cleaned and  disinfected in accordance with Sec. 54.7(e). Additional guidance on  acceptable means of cleaning and disinfection is also available in the  Scrapie Flock Certification Program standards and the Scrapie  Eradication Uniform Methods and Rules. Premises or portions of premises  may be exempted from the cleaning and disinfecting requirements if a  designated scrapie epidemiologist determines, based on epidemiologic  investigation, that cleaning and disinfection of such buildings, holding  facilities, conveyances, or other materials on the premises will not  significantly reduce the risk of the spread of scrapie, either because  effective disinfection is not possible or because the normal operations  on the premises prevent transmission of scrapie. No area where a  scrapie-positive animal lambed or aborted may be exempted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner of the flock, or his or her agent, must request breed  associations and registries, livestock markets, and packers to disclose  records to APHIS representatives or State representatives, to be used to  identify source flocks and trace exposed animals, including high-risk  animals; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The flock owner must agree to conduct post-exposure management  and monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Requirements for post-exposure management and monitoring plans  only: The plan must require that a State or APHIS representative inspect  the flock and flock records at least once every 12 months. The owner of  the flock or his or her agent must maintain, and keep for a minimum of 5  years after an animal dies or is otherwise removed from a flock, the  following records for each animal in the flock:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any identifying marks or tags present on the animal, including  the animal's individual official identification number from its  electronic implant, flank tattoo, ear tattoo, tamper resistant ear tag,  or, in the case of goats, tail fold tattoo, and any secondary form of  identification the owner of the flock may choose to maintain;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sex, year of birth, breed, and when possible to determine, the  following: sire, dam, and offspring of the animal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date of acquisition and previous flock, if the animal was not  born in the flock; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disposition of the animal, including the date and cause of  death, if known, or date of removal from the flock and name and address  of the person to whom the animal was transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Modification of flock plans and post-exposure management and  monitoring plans. A designated scrapie epidemiologist may modify the  requirements of a flock plan or post-exposure management and monitoring  plan to accommodate the situation of a particular flock if the modified  plan requires:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a State or APHIS representative inspect the flock and flock  records at least once every 12 months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The testing of animals at a level that will result in 99 percent  confidence of detecting a 1 percent prevalence in the flock (for flock  plans only);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The official identification of all animals upon leaving the  premises of the flock for purposes other than slaughter and of all  animals over 18 months of age (as evidenced by the eruption of the  second incisor) in slaughter channels; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recordkeeping including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For acquired animals, the date of acquisition, name and address  of the person from whom the animal was acquired, any identifying marks  or tags present on the animal including the animal's individual official  identification number from its electronic implant, flank tattoo, ear  tattoo, tamper resistant ear tag, or, in the case of goats, tail fold  tattoo, and any secondary form of identification the owner of the flock  may choose to maintain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For animals leaving the premises of the flock, the disposition  of the animal, including, for those animals that   are required to be identified, any identifying marks or tags present on  the animal, including the animal's individual official identification  number from its electronic implant, flank tattoo, ear tattoo, tamper  resistant ear tag, or, in the case of goats, a tail fold tattoo, and any  secondary form of identification the owner of the flock may choose to  maintain, the date and cause of death, if known, or date of removal from  the flock and name and address of the person to whom the animal was  transferred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintenance of these records for 5 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requirements equivalent to those contained in paragraphs (b),  (c), (d), and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Post-exposure management and monitoring plans for exposed flocks  that were not source flocks and in which a scrapie infected animal did  not lamb. A designated scrapie epidemiologist shall determine the  testing and monitoring requirements for these flocks based on the  exposure risk of the individual flock.</p>
