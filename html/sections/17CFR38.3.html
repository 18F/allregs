                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application procedures. (1) A board of trade seeking designation as a contract market must file electronically, in a format and manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, the Form DCM provided in appendix A of this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters at submissions@cftc.gov and the Division of Market Oversight at DMOSubmissions@cftc.gov. The Commission will review the application for designation as a contract market pursuant to the 180-day timeframe and procedures specified in section 6(a) of the Act. The Commission shall approve or deny the application or, if deemed appropriate, designate the applicant as a contract market subject to conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The application must include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the core principles specified in section 5(d) of the Act. Form DCM consists of instructions, general questions and a list of exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits required in Form DCM. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of starting the 180-day review period set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The applicant must identify with particularity any information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Sec. 145.9 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 40.8 of this chapter sets forth those sections of the application that will be made publicly available, notwithstanding a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Sec. 145.9 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If any information contained in the application or in any exhibit is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, an amendment to the application or a submission filed under part 40 of this chapter must be filed promptly correcting such information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reinstatement of dormant designation. Before listing or relisting products for trading, a dormant designated contract market as defined in Sec. 40.1 of this chapter must reinstate its designation under the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement may rely upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and accurately describe, current conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Delegation of authority. (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, upon consultation with the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee, authority to notify the applicant seeking designation under section 6(a) of the Act that the application is materially incomplete and the running of the 180-day period is stayed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Director may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter that has been delegated in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Request for transfer of designation--(1) Request for transfer of designation, listed contracts and open interest.

The request must be filed no later than three months prior to the anticipated corporate change; provided that the designated contract market may file a request with the Commission later than three months prior to the anticipated corporate change if the designated contract market does not know and reasonably could not have known of the anticipated change three months prior to the anticipated corporate change. In such event, the designated contract market shall be required to immediately file the request with the Commission as soon as it knows of such change, with an explanation as to the timing of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Required information. The request shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The underlying agreement that governs the corporate change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A narrative description of the corporate change, including the reason for the change and its impact on the designated contract market, including its governance and operations, and its impact on the rights and obligations of market participants holding the open interest positions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A discussion of the transferee's ability to comply with the Act, including the core principles applicable to designated contract markets, and the Commission's regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The governing documents of the transferee including, but not limited to, articles of incorporation and bylaws;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The transferee's rules marked to show changes from the current rules of the designated contract market;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A list of contracts, agreements, transactions or swaps for which the designated contract market requests transfer of open interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> A representation by the transferee that it:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Will be the surviving legal entity and successor-in-interest to the transferor designated contract market and will retain and assume, without limitation, all the assets and liabilities of the transferor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Will assume responsibility for complying with all applicable provisions of the Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder, including part 38 and Appendices thereto;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Will assume, maintain and enforce all rules implementing and complying with these core principles, including the adoption of the transferor's rulebook, as amended in the request, and that any such amendments will be submitted to the Commission pursuant to section 5c(c) of the Act and part 40 of the Commission's regulations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Will comply with all self-regulatory responsibilities except if otherwise indicated in the request, and will maintain and enforce all self-regulatory programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> A representation by the transferee that upon the transfer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All open interest in all contracts listed on the transferor will be transferred to and represent equivalent open interest in all such contracts listed on the transferee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> It will assume responsibility for and maintain compliance with the core principles for all contracts previously listed for trading through the transferor, whether by certification or approval; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> That none of the proposed rule changes will affect the rights and obligations of any market participant with open positions transferred to it and that the proposed rule changes do not modify the manner in which such contracts are settled or cleared.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A representation by the transferee that market participants will be notified of all changes to the transferor's rulebook prior to the transfer and will be further notified of the concurrent transfer of the contract market designation, and the related transfer of all listed contracts and all associated open interest, to the transferee upon Commission approval and issuance of an order permitting this transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Commission determination.
