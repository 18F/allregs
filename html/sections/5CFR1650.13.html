                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A participant electing a full post-employment withdrawal (i.e., a withdrawal of his or her entire account) can elect to withdraw all or a portion of the account balance in a series of substantially equal monthly payments, to be paid in one of the following manners:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A specific dollar amount. The amount elected must be at least $25 per month; if the amount elected is less than $25 per month, the request will be rejected. Payments will be made in the amount requested each month until the account balance is expended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A monthly payment amount calculated based on life expectancy. Payments based on life expectancy are determined using the factors set forth in the Internal Revenue Service life expectancy tables codified at 26 CFR 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A; 1 and 2. The monthly payment amount is calculated by dividing the account balance by the factor from the IRS life expectancy tables based upon the participant's age as of his or her birthday in the year payments are to begin. This amount is then divided by 12 to yield the monthly payment amount. In subsequent years, the monthly payment amount is recalculated each January by dividing the prior December 31 account balance by the factor in the IRS life expectancy tables based upon the participant's age as of his or her birthday in the year payments will be made. There is no minimum amount for a monthly payment calculated based on this method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A participant receiving monthly payments calculated based upon life expectancy can make one election, during a period to be determined by the Executive Director, to change to a fixed monthly payment. A participant can change the amount of his or her

fixed payments annually. A participant who is receiving monthly payments based on a fixed dollar amount, however, cannot elect to change to an amount calculated based on life expectancy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A participant receiving monthly payments, regardless of the calculation method, can elect at any time to receive the remainder of his or her account balance in a final single payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The TSP will ensure that the annual total monthly payments satisfy any applicable minimum distribution requirement of the Internal Revenue Code by making a supplemental payment no later than the last date required by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A participant receiving monthly payments may change the investment of his or her account balance among the TSP investment funds as provided in 5 CFR part 1601.
