Such an order is a final agency action which may be subject to judicial review. The order must contain the commencement date and duration of the suspension, revocation, or modification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If EPA determines that the public health, interest, or welfare warrants immediate action to suspend the certification of any individual or firm prior to the opportunity for a hearing, it will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notify the affected entity in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section, explaining why it is necessary to suspend the entity's certification before an opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the affected entity of its right to request a hearing on the immediate suspension within 15 days of the suspension taking place and the procedures for the conduct of such a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any notice, decision, or order issued by EPA under this section, any transcript or other verbatim record of oral testimony, and any documents filed by a certified individual or firm in a hearing under this section will be available to the public, except as otherwise provided by section 14 of TSCA or by part 2 of this title. Any such hearing at which oral testimony is presented will be open to the public, except that the Presiding Officer may exclude the public to the extent necessary to allow presentation of information which may be entitled to confidential treatment under section 14 of TSCA or part 2 of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> EPA will maintain a publicly available list of entities whose certification has been suspended, revoked, modified, or reinstated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Unless the decision and order issued under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section specify otherwise:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An individual whose certification has been suspended must take a refresher training course (renovator or dust sampling technician) in order to make his or her certification current.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An individual whose certification has been revoked must take an initial renovator or dust sampling technician course in order to become certified again.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A firm whose certification has been revoked must reapply for certification after the revocation ends in order to become certified again. If the firm's certification has been suspended and the suspension ends less than 5 years after the firm was initially certified or re-certified, the firm does not need to do anything to re-activate its certification.
