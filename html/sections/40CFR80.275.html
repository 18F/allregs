Sulfur allotments generated  under this section may be transferred, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No allotment may be transferred more than twice: The first  transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the allotment may only  be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the allotment; if  the transferee cannot use the allotment, it may make the second, and  final, transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the  allotment. In no case may an allotment be transferred more than twice  before being used or terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The allotment transferor must apply any allotments necessary to  meet the transferor's corporate pool average standard before  transferring allotments to any other refiner or importer or before  converting allotments into credits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The transferor must supply to the transferee records indicating  the year of generation and type of the allotments, the identity of the  refiner or importer who generated the allotments, and the identity of  the transferring party, if it is not the same part that generated the  allotments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The transferor must inform the transferee whether any  transferred allotments are Type A allotments or Type B allotments, as  defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of allotments that have been calculated or created  improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following  provisions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Invalid allotments cannot be used to achieve compliance with the  transferee's corporate pool average standard or be converted to credits,  regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the allotments  were valid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The refiner or importer who used the allotments, and any  transferor of the allotments, must adjust their allotment records and  reports and sulfur calculations as necessary to reflect the proper  allotments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any allotments remaining after correcting for the improperly  created allotments must first be applied to correct the invalid  transfers before the transferor may transfer any other allotments or  before converting allotments into credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conversion of allotments into credits. A refiner or importer may  convert allotments into credits using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Type A allotments may be converted into credits with the same  requirements and limitations on use that apply under Sec. 80.315 to  credits generated in 2000 through 2003.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Type B allotments may be converted into credits with the same  requirements and limitations on use that apply under Sec. 80.315 to  credits generated in 2004 and later, based on the year of creation of  the allotment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 which are carried over to  2005 are discounted by 50 percent. The discounted allotments may be used  to demonstrate compliance with the corporate pool average standard in  2005, or they may be converted into credits for use in demonstrating  compliance with the refinery average standard in 2005, or in a  subsequent averaging period, in accordance with the provisions of this  paragraph (e). Any allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 that are  converted into credits before being carried over to 2005 are not  discounted. Any allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 that are converted  into credits before being carried over to 2005 may be reconverted into  allotments for use in demonstrating compliance with the corporate pool  average standard in 2005, but such reconverted allotments are discounted  by 50 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Small refiners. Small refiners subject to the standards under  Sec. 80.240 may not generate sulfur allotments under paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> GPA gasoline. GPA gasoline that is included in the refiner's or  importer's corporate pool average under Sec. 80.216(f)(2) must be  included in the calculations under paragraph (b) of this section. No  refiner or importer may generate allotments in 2004 or 2005 who is not  required to meet the corporate pool average standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Allotments and credits under this program are in units of ``ppm- gallons''.
