A tank vessel, as defined under section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably expect to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance. These response plans are required to be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans. These regulations are codified as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For tank vessels, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 155;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For offshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 30 CFR part 254;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For non-transportation related onshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 40 CFR 112.20;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For transportation-related onshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 154;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For pipeline facilities, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 194; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For rolling stock, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 106 et al.</p>
