                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section, the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.179-1 through 1.179-5 apply for  property placed in service by the taxpayer in taxable years ending after  January 25, 1993. However, a taxpayer may apply the provisions of  Sec. Sec. 1.179-1 through 1.179-5 to property placed in service by the  taxpayer after December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending on or before  January 25, 1993. Otherwise, for property placed in service by the  taxpayer after December 31, 1986, in taxable years ending on or before  January 25, 1993, the final regulations under section 179 as in effect  for the year the property was placed in service apply, except to the  extent modified by the changes made to section 179 by the Tax Reform Act  of 1986 (100 Stat. 2085), the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1988 (102 Stat. 3342) and the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 (104  Stat. 1388-400). For that property, a taxpayer may apply any reasonable  method that clearly reflects income in applying the changes to section  179, provided the taxpayer consistently applies the method to the  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)(ii)</em>, the second sentence of Sec. 1.179- 4(a), and the provisions of Sec. 1.179-5(c), reflecting changes made to  section 179 by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003  (117 Stat. 752) and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (118 Stat.  1418), apply for property placed in service in taxable years beginning  after 2002 and before 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of Sec. 1.179-5(d). Section 1.179-5(d) applies on  or after July 12, 2005.  [T.D. 9146, 69 FR 46985, Aug. 4, 2004.

If a recapture event occurs with respect to a  taxpayer's qualified clean-fuel vehicle property or qualified clean-fuel  vehicle refueling property, the taxpayer must include the recapture  amount in taxable income for the taxable year in which the recapture  event occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Recapture event--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general.

Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(1)(i)(D) of this section, a sale or other disposition (including a  disposition by reason of an accident or other casualty) of qualified  clean-fuel vehicle property is not a recapture event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  A recapture event occurs if, at any time before the end of its recovery  period, the property ceases to be qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling  property. Property ceases to be qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling  property if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The property no longer qualifies as property described in  section 179A(d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The property is no longer used predominantly in a trade or  business (property will be treated as no longer used predominantly in a  trade or business if 50 percent or more of the use of the property in a  taxable year is for use other than in a trade or business);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The property is used by the taxpayer in a manner described in  section 50(b); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The taxpayer receiving the deduction under section 179A sells or  disposes of the property and knows or has reason to know that the  property will be used in a manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (A),  (B), or (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for disposition. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(2)(i)(D) of this section, a sale or other disposition (including a  disposition by reason of an accident or other casualty) of qualified  clean-fuel vehicle refueling property is not a recapture event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Recapture date--(1) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property.

The  recapture amount is equal to the benefit of the section 179A deduction  allowable multiplied by the recapture percentage. The recapture  percentage is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 100, if the recapture date is within the first full year after  the date the vehicle is placed in service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 66\2/3\, if the recapture date is within the second full year  after the date the vehicle is placed in service; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 33\1/3\, if the recapture date is within the third full year  after the date the vehicle is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property. The recapture  amount is equal to the benefit of the section 179A deduction allowable  multiplied by the following fraction. The numerator of the fraction  equals the total recovery period for the property minus the number of  recovery years prior to, but not including, the recapture year. The  denominator of the fraction equals the total recovery period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Basis adjustment. As of the first day of the taxable year in  which the recapture event occurs, the basis of the vehicle of which  qualified clean-fuel vehicle property is a part or the basis of  qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property is increased by the  recapture amount. For a vehicle or refueling property that is of a  character that is subject to an allowance for depreciation, this  increase in basis is recoverable over its remaining recovery period  beginning as of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture  event occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Application of section 1245 for sales and other dispositions.  For purposes of section 1245, the amount of the deduction allowable  under section 179A(a) with respect to any property that is (or has been)  of a character subject to an allowance for depreciation is treated as a  deduction allowed for depreciation under section 167. Therefore, upon a  sale or other disposition of depreciable qualified clean-fuel vehicle  refueling property or a depreciable vehicle of which qualified clean- fuel vehicle property is a part, section 1245 will apply to any gain  recognized to the extent the basis of the depreciable property or  vehicle was reduced under section 179A(e)(6) net of any basis increase  described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in  service for personal use on January 1, 1995, a clean-fuel vehicle, a  portion of which is qualified clean-fuel vehicle property, costing  $25,000. The qualified clean-fuel vehicle property costs $11,000. On A's  1995 federal income tax return, A claims a section 179A deduction of  $2,000. On January 2, 1996, A sells the vehicle to an unrelated third  party who subsequently converts the vehicle into a gasoline-propelled  vehicle on October 15, 1996. There is no recapture upon the sale of the  vehicle by A provided A did not know or have reason to know that the  purchaser intended to convert the vehicle to a gasoline-propelled  vehicle.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in  service for personal use on October 11, 1994, a clean-fuel vehicle  costing $20,000, a portion of which is qualified clean-fuel vehicle  property. The qualified clean-fuel vehicle property costs $10,000. On  B's 1994 federal income tax return, B claims a deduction of $2,000,  which reduces B's gross income by $2,000. The basis of the vehicle is  reduced to $18,000 ($20,000-$2,000). On January 31, 1996, B sells the  vehicle to a tax-exempt entity. Because B knowingly sold the vehicle to  a tax-exempt entity described in section 50(b) in the second full year  from the date the vehicle was placed in service, B must recapture $1,333  ($2,000 x 66\2/3\ percent). This recapture amount increases B's gross  income by $1,333 on B's 1996 federal income tax return and is added to  the basis of the motor vehicle as of January 1, 1996, the beginning of  the taxable year of recapture.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. X, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in  service for its business use on January 1, 1994, qualified clean-fuel  vehicle refueling property costing $400,000. Assume this property has a  5-year recovery period. On X's 1994 federal income tax return, X claims  a deduction of $100,000, which reduces X's gross income by $100,000. The  basis of the property is reduced to $300,000 ($400,000-$100,000) prior  to any adjustments for depreciation. In 1996, more than 50 percent of  the use of the property is other than in X's trade or business.</p><p class="depth0">Because the property is no longer used predominantly in X's  business, X must recapture three-fifths of the section 179A deduction or  $60,000 ($100,000x(5-2)/5 = $60,000) and include that amount in gross  income on its 1996 federal income tax return. The recapture amount of  $60,000 is added to the basis of the property as of January 1, 1996, the  beginning of the taxable year of recapture, and to the extent the  property remains depreciable, the   adjusted basis is recoverable over the remaining recovery period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. X, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in  service for business use on January 1, 1994, qualified clean-fuel  vehicle refueling property costing $350,000. Assume this property has a  5-year recovery period. On X's 1994 federal income tax return, X claims  a deduction of $100,000, which reduces X's gross income by $100,000. The  basis of the property is reduced to $250,000 ($350,000-$100,000) prior  to any adjustments for depreciation. In 1995, X converts the property to  store and dispense gasoline. Because the property is no longer used as  qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property in 1995, X must  recapture four-fifths of the section 179A deduction or $80,000  ($100,000x(5-1)/5 = $80,000) and include that amount in gross income on  its 1995 federal income tax return. The recapture amount of $80,000 is  added to the basis of the property as of January 1, 1995, the beginning  of the taxable year of recapture, and to the extent the property remains  depreciable, the adjusted basis is recoverable over the remaining  recovery period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4. In 1996, X sells  the refueling property for $351,000, recognizing a gain from this sale.  Under paragraph (f) of this section, section 1245 will apply to any gain  recognized on the sale of depreciable property to the extent the basis  of the property was reduced by the section 179A deduction net of any  basis increase from recapture of the section 179A deduction.  Accordingly, the gain from the sale of the property is subject to  section 1245 to the extent of the depreciation allowance for the  property plus the deduction allowed under section 179A ($100,000), less  the previous recapture amount ($80,000). Any remaining amount of gain  may be subject to other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date. This section is effective on October 14, 1994.  If the recapture date is before the effective date of this section, a  taxpayer may use any reasonable method to recapture the benefit of any  deduction allowable under section 179A(a) consistent with section 179A  and its legislative history. For this purpose, the recapture date is  defined in paragraph (c) of this section.  [T.D. 8606, 60 FR 39651, Aug. 3, 1995]    Sec. 1.179B-1T  Deduction for capital costs incurred in complying with Environmental Protection Agency sulfur regulations (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. This section provides the  rules for determining the amount of the deduction allowable under  section 179B(a) for qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a small  business refiner to comply with the highway diesel fuel sulfur control  requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This section  also provides rules for making elections under section 179B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 179B and this section, the  following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicable EPA regulations are the EPA regulations  establishing the highway diesel fuel sulfur control program (40 CFR part  80, subpart I).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The average daily domestic refinery run for a refinery is the  lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The total amount of crude oil input (in barrels) to the  refinery's domestic processing units during the 1-year period ending on  December 31, 2002, divided by 365; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total amount of refined petroleum product (in barrels)  produced by the refinery's domestic processing units during such 1-year  period divided by 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The aggregate average domestic daily refinery run for a  refiner is the sum of the average daily domestic refinery runs for all  refineries that were owned by the refiner or a related person on April  1, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cooperative owner is a person that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Directly holds an ownership interest in a cooperative small  business refiner, as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is a cooperative to which part 1 of subchapter T of the Internal  Revenue Code (Code) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Cooperative small business refiner is a small business refiner  that is a cooperative to which part 1 of subchapter T of the Code  applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Low sulfur diesel fuel has the meaning prescribed in section  45H(c)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Qualified capital costs are qualified costs as defined in  section 45H(c)(2) that are properly chargeable to capital account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Related person has the meaning prescribed in section  613A(d)(3) and the regulations under section 613A(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Small business refiner has the meaning prescribed in section  45H(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 179B deduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Section 179B(a) allows a  deduction   with respect to the qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a small  business refiner (the section 179B deduction). The deduction is  allowable with respect to the qualified capital costs paid or incurred  during a taxable year only if the small business refiner makes an  election under paragraph (d) of this section for the taxable year. The  certification requirement in section 45H(e) (relating to the  certification required to support a credit under section 45H) does not  apply for purposes of the section 179B deduction. Accordingly, the  section 179B deduction is allowable with respect to the qualified  capital costs of an electing small business refiner even if the refiner  never obtains a certification under section 45H(e) with respect to those  costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Computation of section 179B deduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as  provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (c)(3) of this section, a small  business refiner that makes an election under paragraph (d) of this  section for a taxable year is allowed a section 179B deduction in an  amount equal to 75 percent of qualified capital costs that are paid or  incurred by the small business refiner during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduced percentage. A small business refiner's section 179B  deduction is reduced if the refiner's aggregate average daily domestic  refinery run is in excess of 155,000 barrels. In that case, the number  of percentage points used in computing the deduction under paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section (75) is reduced (not below zero) by the  product of 75 and the ratio of the excess barrels to 50,000 barrels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph (b) is illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an accrual method taxpayer, is a small business  refiner with a taxable year ending December 31. On April 1, 2003, A owns  a refinery with an average daily domestic refinery run (that is, an  average daily run during calendar year 2002) of 100,000 barrels and a  person related to A owns a refinery with an average daily domestic  refinery run of 85,000 barrels. These are the only domestic refineries  owned by A and persons related to A. A's aggregate average daily  domestic refinery run for the two refineries is 185,000 barrels. A  incurs qualified capital costs of $10 million in the taxable year ended  December 31, 2007. The costs are incurred with respect to property that  is placed in service in year 2008. A makes the election under paragraph  (d) of this section for the 2007 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because A's aggregate average daily domestic refinery run is  185,000 barrels, the percentage of the qualified capital costs that is  deductible under section 179B(a) is reduced from 75 percent to 30  percent (75 percent reduced by 75 percent multiplied by 0.6 ((185,000  barrels minus 155,000 barrels)/50,000 barrels)). Thus, for 2007, A's  deduction under section 179B(a) is $3,000,000 ($10,000,000 qualified  capital costs multiplied by .30).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect on basis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If qualified capital costs are  included in the basis of property, the basis of the property is reduced  by the amount of the section 179B deduction allowed with respect to such  costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment as depreciation. If qualified capital costs are  included in the basis of depreciable property, the amount of the section  179B deduction allowed with respect to such costs is treated as a  depreciation deduction for purposes of section 1245.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election to deduct qualified capital costs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Section 179B election. This paragraph (d) prescribes rules for the  election to deduct the qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a  small business refiner during a taxable year (the section 179B  election). A small business refiner making the section 179B election for  a taxable year consents to, and agrees to apply, all of the provisions  of section 179B and this section to qualified capital costs paid or  incurred by the refiner during the taxable year. The section 179B  election for a taxable year applies with respect to all qualified  capital costs paid or incurred by the small business refiner during that  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Year-by-year election. A separate section 179B election must be  made for each taxable year in which the taxpayer seeks to deduct  qualified capital costs under section 179B. A small business refiner may  make the section 179B election for some taxable years and not for other  taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Elections for cooperative small business refiners. See  paragraph (e) of this section for the rules applicable to the election  provided under section   179B(e), relating to the election to allocate the section 179B deduction  to cooperative owners of a cooperative small business refiner (the  section 179B(e) election).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner for making section 179B election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time for  making election. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this  section, a taxpayer's section 179B election for a taxable year must be  made by the due date (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's  Federal income tax return for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner of making election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided  in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the section 179B election for  a taxable year is made by claiming a section 179B deduction on the  taxpayer's original Federal income tax return for the taxable year and  attaching the statement described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this  section to the return. The section 179B election with respect to  qualified capital costs paid or incurred by a partnership is made by the  partnership and the section 179B election with respect to qualified  capital costs paid or incurred by an S corporation is made by the S  corporation. In the case of qualified capital costs paid or incurred by  the members of a consolidated group (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1502- 1(h)), the section 179B election with respect to such costs is made for  each member by the common parent of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Information required in election statement. The election  statement attached to the taxpayer's return must contain the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name and identification number of the small business  refiner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the qualified capital costs paid or incurred  during the taxable year for which the election is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The aggregate average daily domestic refinery run (as determined  under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The date by which the small business refiner must comply with  the applicable EPA regulations. If this date is not June 1, 2006, the  statement also must explain why compliance is not required by June 1,  2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The calculation of the section 179B deduction for the taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For each property that will have its basis reduced on account of  the section 179B deduction for the taxable year, a description of the  property, the amount included in the basis of the property on account of  qualified capital costs paid or incurred during the taxable year, and  the amount of the basis reduction to that property on account of the  section 179B deduction for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Code, the  regulations under the Code, or other guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin, a section 179B election is valid only if made at the  time and in the manner prescribed in this paragraph (d)(2). For example,  except as otherwise expressly provided, the 179B election cannot be made  for a taxable year to which this section applies through a request under  section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revocation of election. An election made under this paragraph  (d) may not be revoked without the prior written consent of the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue. To seek the Commissioner's consent,  the taxpayer must submit a request for a private letter ruling (for  further guidance, see, for example, Rev. Proc. 2008-1 (2008-1 IRB 1) and  Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to make election. If a small business refiner does not  make the section 179B election for a taxable year at the time and in the  manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no deduction is  allowed for the qualified capital costs that the refiner paid or  incurred during the year. Instead these qualified capital costs are  chargeable to a capital account in that taxable year, the basis of the  property to which these costs are capitalized is not reduced on account  of section 179B, and the amount of depreciation allowable for the  property attributable to these costs is determined by reference to these  costs unreduced by section 179B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Elections for taxable years ending before June 26, 2008. This  section does not apply to section 179B elections for taxable years  ending before June 26, 2008. The rules for making the section 179B  election for a taxable year ending   before June 26, 2008 are provided in Notice 2006-47 (2006-20 IRB 892).  See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> to allocate section 179B  deduction to cooperative owners--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A cooperative small  business refiner may elect to allocate part or all of its cooperative  owners' ratable shares of the section 179B deduction for a taxable year  to the cooperative owners (the section 179B(e) election). The section  179B deduction allocated to a cooperative owner is equal to the  cooperative owner's ratable share of the total section 179B deduction  allocated. A cooperative owner's ratable share is determined for this  purpose on the basis of the cooperative owner's ownership interest in  the cooperative small business refiner during the cooperative small  business refiner's taxable year. If the cooperative owners' interests  vary during the year, the cooperative small business refiner shall  determine the owners' ratable shares under a consistently applied method  that reasonably takes into account the owners' varying interests during  the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cooperative small business refiner denied section 1382 deduction  for allocated portion. In computing taxable income under section 1382, a  cooperative small business refiner must reduce its section 179B  deduction for the taxable year by an amount equal to the section 179B  deduction allocated under this paragraph (e) to the refiner's  cooperative owners for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time and manner for making election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time for making  election. The section 179B(e) election for a taxable year must be made  by the due date (including extensions) for filing the cooperative small  business refiner's Federal income tax return for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner of making election. The section 179B(e) election for a  taxable year is made by attaching a statement to the cooperative small  business refiner's Federal income tax return for the taxable year. The  election statement must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name and identification number of the cooperative small  business refiner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of the section 179B deduction allowable to the  cooperative small business refiner for the taxable year (determined  before the application of section 179B(e) and this paragraph (e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The name and identification number of each cooperative owner to  which the cooperative small business refiner is allocating all or some  of the section 179B deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The amount of the section 179B deduction that is allocated to  each cooperative owner listed in response to paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Irrevocable election. A section 179B(e) election for a taxable  year, once made, is irrevocable for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Written notice to owners. A cooperative small business refiner  that makes a section 179B(e) election for a taxable year must notify  each cooperative owner of the amount of the section 179B deduction that  is allocated to that cooperative owner. This notification must be  provided in a written notice that is mailed by the cooperative small  business refiner to its cooperative owner before the due date (including  extensions) of the cooperative small business refiner's Federal income  tax return for the election year. In addition, the cooperative small  business refiner must report the amount of the cooperative owner's  section 179B deduction on Form 1099-PATR, ``Taxable Distributions  Received From Cooperatives,'' issued to the cooperative owner. If Form  1099-PATR is revised or renumbered, the amount of the cooperative  owner's section 179B deduction must be reported on the revised or  renumbered form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This section  applies to taxable years ending on or after June 26, 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application to taxable years ending before June 26, 2008. A  small business refiner may apply this section to a taxable year ending  before June 26, 2008, provided that the small business refiner applies  all provisions in this section, with the modifications described in  paragraph (f)(3) of this section, to the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Modifications applicable to taxable years ending before June 26,  2008. The following modifications to the rules of this section apply to  a small business refiner that applies those rules to a   taxable year ending before June 26, 2008:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rules relating to section 179B election. The section 179B  election for a taxable year ending before June 26, 2008 may be made  under the rules provided in Notice 2006-47, rather than under the rules  set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules relating to section 179B(e) election. A section 179B(e)  election for a taxable year ending before June 26, 2008 will be treated  as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f) if the cooperative small  business refiner has calculated its tax liability in a manner consistent  with the election and has used any reasonable method consistent with the  principles of section 179B(e) to inform the Internal Revenue Service  that an election has been made under section 179B(e) and to inform  cooperative owners of the amount of the section 179B deduction they have  been allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Expiration date. The applicability of Sec. 179B-1T expires on  June 24, 2011.

This section provides the  rules for determining the deduction allowable under section 179C(a) for  the cost of any qualified refinery property. The provisions of this  section apply only to a taxpayer that elects to apply section 179C in  the manner prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 179C and this section, the  following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicable environmental laws are any applicable federal, state,  or local environmental laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified fuels has the meaning set forth in section 45K(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cost is the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in Sec.  1.168(b)-1(a)(3), but without regard to the reduction in basis for any  portion of the basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense  under section 179C and this section) of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Throughput is a volumetric rate measuring the flow of crude  oil, qualified fuels, or, in the case of property placed in service  after October 3, 2008, and before January 1, 2014, shale or tar sands,  processed over a given period of time, typically referenced on the basis  of barrels per calendar day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Barrels per calendar day is the amount of fuels that a facility  can process under usual operating conditions, expressed in terms of  capacity during a 24-hour period and reduced to account for down time  and other limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> United States has the same meaning as that term is defined in  section 7701(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Qualified refinery property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Qualified refinery  property is any property that meets the requirements set forth in  paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of qualified refinery property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Property that comprises any portion of a qualified refinery may be  qualified refinery property. For purposes of section 179C and this  section, a qualified refinery is any refinery located in the United  States that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of property placed in service after August 8, 2005,  and on or before October 3, 2008, is designed to serve the primary  purpose of processing liquid fuel from crude oil or qualified fuels; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of property placed in service after October 3, 2008,  and before January 1, 2014, is designed to serve the primary purpose of  processing liquid fuel from crude oil, qualified fuels, or directly from  shale or tar sands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonqualified refinery property. Refinery property is not  qualified refinery property for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The primary purpose of the refinery property is for use as a  topping plant, asphalt plant, lube oil facility, crude or product  terminal, or blending facility; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The refinery property is built solely to comply with consent  decrees or projects mandated by Federal, State, or local governments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>,  acquired or self-constructed property that contains used parts will be  treated as reconditioned or rebuilt only if the cost of the used parts  is more than 20 percent of the total cost of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sale-leaseback. If any new portion of a qualified refinery is  originally placed in service by a person after August 8, 2005, and is  sold to a taxpayer and leased back to the person by the taxpayer within  three months after the date the property was originally placed in  service by the person, the taxpayer-lessor is considered the original  user of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Placed-in-service date--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Refinery property will  meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the property is placed  in service by the taxpayer after August 8, 2005, and before January 1,  2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sale-leaseback. If a new portion of refinery property is  originally placed in service by a person after August 8, 2005, and is  sold to a taxpayer and leased back to the person by the taxpayer within  three months after the date the property was originally placed in  service by the person, the property is treated as originally placed in  service by the taxpayer-lessor not earlier than the date on which the  property is used by the lessee under the leaseback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Production capacity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Refinery property is  considered qualified refinery property if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It enables the existing qualified refinery to increase the total  volume output, determined without regard to asphalt or lube oil, by at  least 5 percent on an average daily basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of property placed in service after August 8, 2005,  and on or before October 3, 2008, it enables the existing qualified  refinery to increase the percentage of total throughput attributable to  processing qualified fuels to a rate that is at least 25 percent of  total throughput on an average daily basis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of property placed in service after October 3, 2008,  and before January 1, 2014, it enables the existing qualified refinery  to increase the percentage of total throughput attributable to  processing qualified fuels, shale, or tar sands to a rate that is at  least 25 percent of total throughput on an average daily basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When production capacity is tested. The production capacity  requirement of this paragraph (b)(5) is determined as of the date the  property is placed in service by the taxpayer. Any reasonable method may  be used to determine the appropriate baseline for measuring capacity  increases and to demonstrate and substantiate that the capacity of the  existing qualified refinery has been sufficiently increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Multi-stage projects. In the case of multi-stage projects, a  taxpayer must satisfy the reporting requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of  this section, sufficient to establish that the production capacity  requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) will be met as a result of the  taxpayer's overall plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Applicable environmental laws--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The environmental  compliance requirement applies only with respect to refinery property,  or any portion of refinery property, that is placed in service after  August 8, 2005. A refinery's failure to meet applicable environmental  laws with respect to a portion of the refinery that was in service prior  to August 8, 2005 will not disqualify a taxpayer from making the  election under section 179C(a) with respect to otherwise qualifying  refinery property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Waiver under the Clean Air Act. Refinery property must comply  with the Clean Air Act, notwithstanding any waiver received by the  taxpayer under that Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Construction of property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Qualified property  will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(7) if no written  binding contract for the construction of the property was in effect  before June 14, 2005, and if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The construction of the property is subject to a written binding  contract entered into before January 1, 2010;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The property is placed in service before January 1, 2010; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of self-constructed property, the construction of  the property began after June 14, 2005, and before January 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of binding contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. A contract is  binding only if it is enforceable under state law against the taxpayer  or a predecessor, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for  example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, a  contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least  5 percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting  damages to a specified amount. In determining whether a contract limits  damages, the fact that there may be little or no damages because the  contract price does not significantly differ from fair market value will  not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conditions. A contract is binding even if subject to a  condition, as long as the condition is not within the control of either  party or the predecessor of either party. A contract will continue to be  binding if the parties make insubstantial changes in its terms and  conditions, or if any term is to be determined by a standard beyond the  control of either party. A contract that imposes significant obligations  on the taxpayer or a predecessor will be treated as binding,  notwithstanding the fact that insubstantial terms remain to be  negotiated by the parties to the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Options. An option to either acquire or sell property is not a  binding contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Supply agreements. A binding contract does not include a supply  or similar agreement if the payment amount and design specification of  the property to be purchased have not been specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Components. A binding contract to acquire one or more components  of a larger property will not be treated as a binding contract to  acquire the larger property. If a binding contract to acquire a  component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(7),  the component is not qualified refinery property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Self-constructed property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided  in paragraph (b)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, if a taxpayer manufactures,  constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or  business (or for the production of income by the taxpayer), the  construction of property rules in this paragraph (b)(7) are treated as  met for qualified refinery property if the taxpayer begins  manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property after June 14,  2005, and before January 1, 2010. Property that is manufactured,  constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a  written binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this  section) that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or  production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or  business (or for the production of income) is considered to be  manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When construction begins. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(7)(iii), construction of property generally begins when physical  work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include  preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing  financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical  work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Components of self-constructed property--(1) Acquired  components. If a binding contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of  this section) to acquire a component of self-constructed property is in  effect on or before June 14, 2005, the component does not satisfy the  requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, and is not  qualified refinery property. However, if construction of the self- constructed property   begins after June 14, 2005, the self-constructed property may be  qualified refinery property if it meets all other requirements of  section 179C and this section (including paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this  section), even though the component is not qualified refinery property.  If the construction of self-constructed property begins before June 14,  2005, neither the self-constructed property nor any component related to  the self-constructed property is qualified refinery property. If the  component is acquired before January 1, 2010, but the construction of  the self-constructed property begins after December 31, 2009, the  component may qualify as qualified refinery property even if the self- constructed property is not qualified refinery property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Self-constructed components. If the manufacture, construction,  or production of a component fails to meet any of the requirements of  paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, the component is not qualified  refinery property. However, if the manufacture, construction, or  production of a component fails to meet any of the requirements provided  in paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section, but the construction of the  self-constructed property begins after June 14, 2005, the self  constructed property may qualify as qualified refinery property if it  meets all other requirements of section 179C and this section (including  paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section). If the construction of the self- constructed property begins before June 14, 2005, neither the self- constructed property nor any components related to the self-constructed  property are qualified refinery property. If the component was self- constructed before January 1, 2010, but the construction of the self- constructed property begins after December 31, 2009, the component may  qualify as qualified refinery property, although the self-constructed  property is not qualified refinery property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of expense deduction for qualified refinery  property. In general, the allowable deduction under paragraph (d) of  this section for qualified refinery property is determined by  multiplying by 50 percent the cost of the qualified refinery property  paid or incurred by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer may make an election to  deduct as an expense 50 percent of the cost of any qualified refinery  property. A taxpayer making this election takes the 50 percent deduction  for the taxable year in which the qualified refinery property is placed  in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner for making election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time for making  election. An election specified in this paragraph (d) generally must be  made not later than the due date (including extensions) for filing the  original Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the  qualified refinery property is placed in service by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner of making election. The taxpayer makes an election under  section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d) by entering the amount of the  deduction at the appropriate place on the taxpayer's timely filed  original Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the  qualified refinery property is placed in service, and attaching a report  as specified in paragraph (f) of this section to the taxpayer's timely  filed original federal income tax return for the taxable year in which  the qualified refinery property is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revocation of election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An election made under  section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d), and any specification contained  in such election, may not be revoked except with the consent of the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Revocation prior to the revocation deadline. A taxpayer is  deemed to have requested, and to have been granted, the consent of the  Commissioner to revoke an election under section 179C(a) and this  paragraph (d) if the taxpayer revokes the election before the revocation  deadline. The revocation deadline is 24 months after the due date  (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's Federal income return  for the taxable year for which the election applies. An election under  section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d) is revoked by attaching a  statement to an amended return for the taxable year for which the  election applies. The statement must specify the name and address of the  refinery for which the election applies and the amount deducted on the  taxpayer's   original Federal income tax return for the taxable year for which the  election applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Revocation after the revocation deadline. An election under  section 179C(a) and this paragraph (d) may not be revoked after the  revocation deadline. The revocation deadline may not be extended under  Sec. 301.9100-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Revocation by cooperative taxpayer. A taxpayer that has made an  election to allocate the section 179C deduction to cooperative owners  under section 179C(g) and paragraph (e) of this section may not revoke  its election under section 179C(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Election to allocate section 179C deduction to cooperative  owners--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a cooperative taxpayer makes an election  under section 179C(g) and this paragraph (e), the cooperative taxpayer  may elect to allocate all, some, or none of the deduction allowable  under section 179C(a) for that taxable year to the cooperative owner(s).  This allocation is equal to the cooperative owner(s)' ratable share of  the total amount allocated, determined on the basis of each cooperative  owner's ownership interest in the cooperative taxpayer. For purposes of  this section, a cooperative taxpayer is an organization to which part I  of subchapter T applies, and in which another organization to which part  I of subchapter T applies (cooperative owner) directly holds an  ownership interest. No deduction shall be allowed under section 1382 for  any amount allocated under this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner for making election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time for making  election. A cooperative taxpayer must make the election under section  179C(g) and this paragraph (e) by the due date (including extensions)  for filing the cooperative taxpayer's original Federal income tax return  for the taxable year to which the cooperative taxpayer's election under  section 179C(a) and paragraph (d) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner of making election. An election under this paragraph (e)  is made by attaching to the cooperative taxpayer's timely filed Federal  income tax return for the taxable year (including extensions) to which  the cooperative taxpayer's election under section 179C(a) and paragraph  (d) of this section applies a statement providing the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name and taxpayer identification number of the cooperative  taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of the deduction allowable to the cooperative  taxpayer for the taxable year to which the election under section  179C(a) and paragraph (d) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The name and taxpayer identification number of each cooperative  owner to which the cooperative taxpayer is allocating all or some of the  deduction allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The amount of the allowable deduction that is allocated to each  cooperative owner listed in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Written notice to owners. If any portion of the deduction  allowable under section 179C(a) is allocated to a cooperative owner, the  cooperative taxpayer must notify the cooperative owner of the amount of  the deduction allocated to the cooperative owner in a written notice,  and on Form 1099-PATR, ``Taxable Distributions Received from  Cooperatives.'' This notice must be provided on or before the due date  (including extensions) of the cooperative taxpayer's original federal  income tax return for the taxable year for which the cooperative  taxpayer's election under section 179C(a) and paragraph (d) of this  section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Irrevocable election. A section 179C(g) election, once made, is  irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reporting requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer may not claim  a deduction under section 179C(a) for any taxable year unless the  taxpayer files a report with the Secretary containing information with  respect to the operation of the taxpayer's refineries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Information to be included in the report. The taxpayer must  specify--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of the refinery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under which production capacity requirement under section  179C(e) and paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section the  taxpayer's qualified refinery qualifies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the refinery is qualified refinery property under  section 179C(d) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, sufficient to  establish that the primary   purpose of the refinery is to process liquid fuel from crude oil,  qualified fuels, or directly from shale or tar sands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The total cost basis of the qualified refinery property at  issue for the taxpayer's current taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The depreciation treatment of the capitalized portion of the  qualified refinery property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time and manner for submitting report--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time for submitting  report. The taxpayer is required to submit the report specified in this  paragraph (f) not later than the due date (including extensions) of the  taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the  qualified refinery property is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Manner of submitting report. The taxpayer must attach the  report specified in this paragraph (f) to the taxpayer's timely filed  original Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the  qualified refinery property is placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable for  taxable years ending on or after August 22, 2011.
