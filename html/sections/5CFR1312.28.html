                            <p class="depth0">Prior to the transmission of classified material to offices outside  OMB, such material will be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers or  envelopes. The inner cover will be sealed and marked with the  classification, and the address of the sender and of the addressee. The  receipt for the document, OMB Form 87, (not required for Confidential  material) will be attached to or placed within the inner envelope to be  signed by the recipient and returned to the sender. Receipts will  identify the sender, the addressee, and the document, and will contain  no classified information. The outer cover or envelope will be sealed  and addressed with no identification of its contents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transmittal of Top Secret material. The transmittal of Top  Secret material shall be by personnel specifically designated by the EOP  Security Officer, or by Department of State diplomatic pouch, by a  messenger-courier system specifically created for that purpose.  Alternatively, it shall be taken to the White House Situation Room for  transmission over secure communications circuits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transmittal of Secret material. The transmittal of Secret  material shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within and between the fifty States, the District of Columbia,  and Puerto Rico: Use one of the authorized means for Top Secret  material, or transmit by U.S. Postal Service express or registered mail.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other Areas. Use the same means authorized for Top Secret, or  transmit by U.S. registered mail through Military Postal Service  facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transmittal of Confidential material. As identified in  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, or transmit by U.S. Postal  Service Certified, first class, or express mail service within and  between the fifty States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transmittal between OMB offices and within the EOP complex.  Classified material will normally be hand carried within and between  offices in the Executive Office of the President complex by cleared OMB  employees. Documents so carried must be protected by the appropriate  cover sheet or outer envelope. Top Secret material will always be hand  carried in this manner. Secret and Confidential material may be  transmitted between offices in the EOP complex by preparing the material  as indicated above (double envelope) and forwarding it by special  messenger service provided by the messenger center. The messenger shall  be advised that the material is classified. Receipts shall be obtained  if Top Secret or Secret material is being transmitted outside of OMB.  Classified material will never be transmitted in the Standard Messenger  Envelope (SF Form 65), or by the Mail Stop system.</p>
