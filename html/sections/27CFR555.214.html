Stocks of explosive materials are to be stored so they can  be easily counted and checked upon inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except with respect to fiberboard or other nonmetal containers,  containers of explosive materials are not to be unpacked or repacked  inside a magazine or within 50 feet of a magazine, and must not be  unpacked or repacked close to other explosive materials. Containers of  explosive materials must be closed while being stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tools used for opening or closing containers of explosive  materials are to be of nonsparking materials, except that metal slitters  may be used for opening fiberboard containers. A wood wedge and a fiber,  rubber, or wooden mallet are to be used for opening or closing wood  containers of explosive materials. Metal tools other than nonsparking  transfer conveyors are not to be stored in any magazine containing high  explosives.</p>
