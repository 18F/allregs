                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies actions that are prohibited and the maximum  civil penalties that we can assess for each violation in accordance with  42 U.S.C. 7522 and 7524. The maximum penalty values listed in paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this section apply as of January 12, 2009. As described  in paragraph (h) of this section, these maximum penalty limits are  different for earlier violations and they may be adjusted as set forth  in 40 CFR part 19.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following prohibitions and requirements apply to  manufacturers of new engines, manufacturers of equipment containing  these engines, and manufacturers of new equipment, except as described  in subparts C and D of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Introduction into commerce. You may not sell, offer for sale, or  introduce or deliver into commerce in the United States or import into  the United States any new engine/equipment after emission standards take  effect for the engine/equipment, unless it is covered by a valid  certificate of conformity for its model year and has the   required label or tag. You also may not take any of the actions listed  in the previous sentence with respect to any equipment containing an  engine subject to this part's provisions unless the engine is covered by  a valid certificate of conformity for its model year and has the  required engine label or tag. We may assess a civil penalty up to  $37,500 for each engine or piece of equipment in violation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), a valid certificate of  conformity is one that applies for the same model year as the model year  of the equipment (except as allowed by Sec.  1068.105(a)), covers the  appropriate category of engines/equipment (such as locomotive or Marine  SI), and conforms to all requirements specified for equipment in the  standard-setting part. Engines/equipment are considered not covered by a  certificate unless they are in a configuration described in the  application for certification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements of this paragraph (a)(1) also cover new  engines you produce to replace an older engine in a piece of equipment,  unless the engine qualifies for the replacement-engine exemption in  Sec.  1068.240.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For engines used in equipment subject to equipment-based  standards, you may not sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver  into commerce in the United States or import into the United States any  new engine unless it is covered by a valid certificate of conformity for  its model year and has the required label or tag. See the standard- setting part for more information about how this prohibition applies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting and recordkeeping. This chapter requires you to record  certain types of information to show that you meet our standards. You  must comply with these requirements to make and maintain required  records (including those described in Sec.  1068.501). You may not deny  us access to your records or the ability to copy your records if we have  the authority to see or copy them. Also, you must give us complete and  accurate reports and information without delay as required under this  chapter. Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph is  prohibited. We may assess a civil penalty up to $37,500 for each day you  are in violation. In addition, knowingly submitting false information is  a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, which may involve criminal penalties and  up to five years imprisonment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Testing and access to facilities. You may not keep us from  entering your facility to test engines/equipment or inspect if we are  authorized to do so. Also, you must perform the tests we require (or  have the tests done for you). Failure to perform this testing is  prohibited. We may assess a civil penalty up to $37,500 for each day you  are in violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following prohibitions apply to everyone with respect to the  engines and equipment to which this part applies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tampering. You may not remove or render inoperative any device  or element of design installed on or in engines/equipment in compliance  with the regulations prior to its sale and delivery to the ultimate  purchaser. You also may not knowingly remove or render inoperative any  such device or element of design after such sale and delivery to the  ultimate purchaser. This includes, for example, operating an engine  without a supply of appropriate quality urea if the emissions control  system relies on urea to reduce NOx emissions or the use of incorrect  fuel or engine oil that renders the emissions control system  inoperative. Section 1068.120 describes how this applies to rebuilding  engines. See the standard-setting part, which may include additional  provisions regarding actions prohibited by this requirement. For a  manufacturer or dealer, we may assess a civil penalty up to $37,500 for  each engine or piece of equipment in violation. For anyone else, we may  assess a civil penalty up to $3,750 for each day an engine or piece of  equipment is operated in violation. This prohibition does not apply in  any of the following situations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You need to repair the engine/equipment and you restore it to  proper functioning when the repair is complete.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You need to modify the engine/equipment to respond to a  temporary emergency and you restore it to proper functioning as soon as  possible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You modify new engines/equipment that another manufacturer has  already certified to meet emission standards and recertify them under  your own family. In this case you must tell the original manufacturer  not to include the modified engines/equipment in the original family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Defeat devices. You may not knowingly manufacture, sell, offer  to sell, or install, any part that bypasses, impairs, defeats, or  disables the control of emissions of any regulated pollutant, except as  explicitly allowed by the standard-setting part. We may assess a civil  penalty up to $3,750 for each part in violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> is deemed to be a manufacturer in violation of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section. We may assess a civil penalty up to  $37,500 for each engine or piece of equipment in violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> is deemed to be a  manufacturer in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. We may  assess a civil penalty up to $37,500 for each engine or piece of  equipment in violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> is deemed to be a manufacturer in violation of  paragraph (a)(1) of this section. We may assess a civil penalty up to  $37,500 for each engine or piece of equipment in violation. Note the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The definition of new is broad for imported engines/equipment;  uncertified engines and equipment (including used engines and equipment)  are generally considered to be new when imported.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Used engines/equipment that were originally manufactured before  applicable EPA standards were in effect are generally not subject to  emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Warranty, recall, and maintenance instructions. You must meet  your obligation to honor your emission-related warranty under Sec.   1068.115, including any commitments you identify in your application for  certification. You must also fulfill all applicable requirements under  subpart F of this part related to emission-related defects and recalls.  You must also provide emission-related installation and maintenance  instructions as described in the standard-setting part. Failure to meet  these obligations is prohibited. Also, except as specifically provided  by regulation, you are prohibited from directly or indirectly  communicating to the ultimate purchaser or a later purchaser that the  emission-related warranty is valid only if the owner has service  performed at authorized facilities or only if the owner uses authorized  parts, components, or systems. We may assess a civil penalty up to  $37,500 for each engine or piece of equipment in violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Labeling. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You may not remove or alter an emission control  information label or other required permanent label except as specified  in this paragraph (b)(7) or otherwise allowed by this chapter. Removing  or altering an emission control information label is a violation of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section. However, it is not a violation to  remove a label in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The engine is destroyed, is permanently disassembled, or  otherwise loses its identity such that the original title to the engine  is no longer valid.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The regulations specifically direct you to remove the label. For  example, see Sec.  1068.235.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The part on which the label is mounted needs to be replaced. In  this case, you must have a replacement part with a duplicate of the  original   label installed by the certifying manufacturer or an authorized agent,  except that the replacement label may omit the date of manufacture if  applicable. We generally require labels to be permanently attached to  parts that will not normally be replaced, but this provision allows for  replacements in unusual circumstances, such as damage in a collision or  other accident.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The original label is incorrect, provided that it is replaced  with the correct label from the certifying manufacturer or an authorized  agent. This allowance to replace incorrect labels does not affect  whether the application of an incorrect original label is a violation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> is a violation of paragraph  (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For labels identifying temporary exemptions, you may not remove  or alter the label while the engine/equipment is in an exempt status.  The exemption is automatically revoked for each engine/equipment for  which the label has been removed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For temporary or removable consumer information labels, only the  ultimate purchaser may remove the label.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may not apply a false emission control information label.  You also may not manufacture, sell, or offer to sell false labels. The  application, manufacture, sale, or offer for sale of false labels is a  violation of this section (such as paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(2) of this  section). Note that applying an otherwise valid emission control  information label to the wrong engine is considered to be applying a  false label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you cause someone to commit a prohibited act in paragraph (a)  or (b) of this section, you are in violation of that prohibition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions from these prohibitions are described in subparts C  and D of this part and in the standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The standard-setting parts describe more requirements and  prohibitions that apply to manufacturers (including importers) and  others under this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The specification of prohibitions and penalties in this part  does not limit the prohibitions and penalties described in the Clean Air  Act. Additionally, a single act may trigger multiple violations under  this section and the Act. We may pursue all available administrative,  civil, or criminal remedies for those violations even if the regulation  references only a single prohibited act in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The maximum penalty values listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of  this section apply as of January 12, 2009. Maximum penalty values for  earlier violations are published in 40 CFR part 19. Maximum penalty  limits may be adjusted after January 12, 2009 based on the Consumer  Price Index. The specific regulatory provisions for changing the maximum  penalties, published in 40 CFR part 19, reference the applicable U.S.  Code citation on which the prohibited action is based.
