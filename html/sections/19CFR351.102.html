                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The Act contains many technical terms applicable to antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. In the case of terms that are not defined in this section or other sections of this part, readers should refer to the relevant provisions of the Act. This section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Defines terms that appear in the Act but are not defined in the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Defines terms that appear in this Part but do not appear in the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Elaborates on the meaning of certain terms that are defined in the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.

The Secretary will not find that control exists on the basis of these factors unless the relationship has the potential to impact decisions concerning the production, pricing, or cost of the subject merchandise or foreign like product. The Secretary will consider the temporal aspect of a relationship in determining whether control exists; normally, temporary circumstances will not suffice as evidence of control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Aggregate basis. ``Aggregate basis'' means the calculation of a country-wide subsidy rate based principally on information provided by the foreign government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Anniversary month. ``Anniversary month'' means the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of publication of an order or suspension of investigation occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> APO. ``APO'' means an administrative protective order described in section 777(c)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Applicant. ``Applicant'' means a representative of an interested party that has applied for access to business proprietary information under an administrative protective order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Article 4/Article 7 review. ``Article 4/Article 7 review'' means a review under section 751(g)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Article 8 violation review. ``Article 8 violation review'' means a review under section 751(g)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Authorized applicant. ``Authorized applicant'' means an applicant that the Secretary has authorized to receive business proprietary information under an APO under section 777(c)(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Changed circumstances review. ``Changed circumstances review'' means a review under section 751(b) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Consumed in the production process.
