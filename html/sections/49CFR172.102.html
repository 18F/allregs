1 This material is poisonous by inhalation (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) in Hazard Zone A (see Sec. 173.116(a) or Sec. 173.133(a) of this subchapter), and must be described as an inhalation hazard under the provisions of this subchapter.2 This material is poisonous by inhalation (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) in Hazard Zone B (see Sec. 173.116(a) or Sec. 173.133(a) of this subchapter), and must be described as an inhalation hazard under the provisions of this subchapter.3 This material is poisonous by inhalation (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) in Hazard Zone C (see Sec. 173.116(a) of this subchapter),

and must be described as an inhalation hazard under the provisions of this subchapter.4 This material is poisonous by inhalation (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) in Hazard Zone D (see Sec. 173.116(a) of this subchapter), and must be described as an inhalation hazard under the provisions of this subchapter.5 If this material meets the definition for a material poisonous by inhalation (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter), a shipping name must be selected which identifies the inhalation hazard, in Division 2.3 or Division 6.1, as appropriate.6 This material is poisonous-by-inhalation and must be described as an inhalation hazard under the provisions of this subchapter.8 A hazardous substance that is not a hazardous waste may be shipped under the shipping description ``Other regulated substances, liquid or solid, n.o.s.'', as appropriate. In addition, for solid materials, special provision B54 applies.9 Packaging for certain PCBs for disposal and storage is prescribed by EPA in 40 CFR 761.60 and 761.65.11 The hazardous material must be packaged as either a liquid or a solid, as appropriate, depending on its physical form at 55 C (131 F) at atmospheric pressure.12 In concentrations greater than 40 percent, this material has strong oxidizing properties and is capable of starting fires in contact with combustible materials. If appropriate, a package containing this material must conform to the additional labeling requirements of Sec. 172.402 of this subchapter.13 The words ``Inhalation Hazard'' shall be entered on each shipping paper in association with the shipping description, shall be marked on each non-bulk package in association with the proper shipping name and identification number, and shall be marked on two opposing sides of each bulk package. Size of marking on bulk package must conform to Sec. 172.302(b) of this subchapter. The requirements of Secs. 172.203(m) and 172.505 of this subchapter do not apply.14 Motor fuel antiknock mixtures are:</p><p class="depth0">a. Mixtures of one or more organic lead mixtures (such as tetraethyl lead, triethylmethyl lead, diethyldimethyl lead, ethyltrimethyl lead, and tetramethyl lead) with one or more halogen compounds (such as ethylene dibromide and ethylene dichloride), hydrocarbon solvents or other equally efficient stabilizers; or</p><p class="depth0">b. tetraethyl lead.15 This entry applies to ``Chemical kits'' and ``First aid kits'' containing one or more compatible items of hazardous materials in boxes, cases, etc. that, for example, are used for medical, analytical, diagnostic, testing, or repair purposes. Kits that are carried on board transport vehicles for first aid or operating purposes are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.16 This description applies to smokeless powder and other solid propellants that are used as powder for small arms and have been classed as Division 1.3C, 1.4C and Division 4.1 in accordance with Sec. 173.56 of this subchapter.19 For domestic transportation only, the identification number ``UN1075'' may be used in place of the identification number specified in column (4) of the Sec. 172.101 table. The identification number used must be consistent on package markings, shipping papers and emergency response information.21 This material must be stabilized by appropriate means (e.g., addition of chemical inhibitor, purging to remove oxygen) to prevent dangerous polymerization (see Sec. 173.21(f) of this subchapter).22 If the hazardous material is in dispersion in organic liquid, the organic liquid must have a flash point above 50 C (122 F).23 This material may be transported under the provisions of Division 4.1 only if it is so packed that the percentage of diluent will not fall below that stated in the shipping description at any time during transport. Quantities of not more than 500 g per package with not less than 10 percent water by mass may also be classed in Division 4.1, provided a negative test result is obtained when tested in accordance with test series 6(c) of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).24 Alcoholic beverages containing more than 70 percent alcohol by volume must be transported as materials in Packing Group II. Alcoholic beverages containing more than 24 percent but not more than 70 percent alcohol by volume must be transported as materials in Packing Group III.26 This entry does not include ammonium permanganate, the transport of which is prohibited except when approved by the Associate Administrator.28 The dihydrated sodium salt of dichloroisocyanuric acid does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Division 5.1 (Oxidizer) and is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter unless meeting the criteria for inclusion in another class or division.30 Sulfur is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter if transported in a non-bulk packaging or if formed to a specific shape (for example, prills, granules, pellets, pastilles, or flakes). A bulk packaging containing sulfur is not subject to the placarding requirements of subpart F of this part, if it is marked with the appropriate identification number as required by subpart D of this part. Molten sulfur must

be marked as required by Sec. 172.325 of this subchapter.31 Materials which have undergone sufficient heat treatment to render them non-hazardous are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.32 Polymeric beads and molding compounds may be made from polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate) or other polymeric material.33 Ammonium nitrites and mixtures of an inorganic nitrite with an ammonium salt are prohibited.34 The commercial grade of calcium nitrate fertilizer, when consisting mainly of a double salt (calcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate) containing not more than 10 percent ammonium nitrate and at least 12 percent water of crystallization, is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.35 Antimony sulphides and oxides which do not contain more than 0.5 percent of arsenic calculated on the total mass do not meet the definition of Division 6.1.37 Unless it can be demonstrated by testing that the sensitivity of the substance in its frozen state is no greater than in its liquid state, the substance must remain liquid during normal transport conditions. It must not freeze at temperatures above -15 C (5 F).38 If this material shows a violent effect in laboratory tests involving heating under confinement, the labeling requirements of Special Provision 53 apply, and the material must be packaged in accordance with packing method OP6 in Sec. 173.225 of this subchapter. If the SADT of the technically pure substance is higher than 75 C, the technically pure substance and formulations derived from it are not self-reactive materials and, if not meeting any other hazard class, are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.39 This substance may be carried under provisions other than those of Class 1 only if it is so packed that the percentage of water will not fall below that stated at any time during transport. When phlegmatized with water and inorganic inert material, the content of urea nitrate must not exceed 75 percent by mass and the mixture should not be capable of being detonated by test 1(a)(i) or test 1(a)(ii) in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).40 Polyester resin kits consist of two components: A base material (Class 3, Packing Group II or III) and an activator (organic peroxide), each separately packed in an inner packaging. The organic peroxide must be type D, E, or F, not requiring temperature control. The components may be placed in the same outer packaging provided they will not interact dangerously in the event of leakage. The Packing Group assigned will be II or III, according to the classification criteria for Class 3, applied to the base material. Additionally, unless otherwise excepted in this subchapter, polyester resin kits must be packaged in specification combination packagings based on the performance level of the base material contained within the kit.41 This material at the Packing Group II hazard criteria level may be transported in Large Packagings.43 The membrane filters, including paper separators and coating or backing materials, that are present in transport, must not be able to propagate a detonation as tested by one of the tests described in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part I, Test series 1(a) (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). On the basis of the results of suitable burning rate tests, and taking into account the standard tests in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 33.2.1 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), nitrocellulose membrane filters in the form in which they are to be transported that do not meet the criteria for a Division 4.1 material are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter. Packagings must be so constructed that explosion is not possible by reason of increased internal pressure. Nitrocellulose membrane filters covered by this entry, each with a mass not exceeding 0.5 g, are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter when contained individually in an article or a sealed packet.44 The formulation must be prepared so that it remains homogenous and does not separate during transport. Formulations with low nitrocellulose contents and neither showing dangerous properties when tested for their ability to detonate, deflagrate or explode when heated under defined confinement by the appropriate test methods and criteria in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), nor classed as a Division 4.1 (flammable solid) when tested in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 173.124 of this subchapter (chips, if necessary, crushed and sieved to a particle size of less than 1.25 mm), are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.45 Temperature should be maintained between 18 C (64.4 F) and 40 C (104 F). Tanks containing solidified methacrylic acid must not be reheated during transport.46 This material must be packed in accordance with packing method OP6 (see Sec. 173.225 of this subchapter). During transport, it must be protected from direct sunshine and stored (or kept) in a cool and well-ventilated place, away from all sources of heat.47 Mixtures of solids that are not subject to this subchapter and flammable liquids may be transported under this entry without

first applying the classification criteria of Division 4.1, provided there is no free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the packaging or transport unit is closed. Except when the liquids are fully absorbed in solid material contained in sealed bags, for single packagings, each packaging must correspond to a design type that has passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level. Small inner packagings consisting of sealed packets and articles containing less than 10 mL of a Class 3 liquid in Packing Group II or III absorbed onto a solid material are not subject to this subchapter provided there is no free liquid in the packet or article.48 Mixtures of solids that are not subject to this subchapter and toxic liquids may be transported under this entry without first applying the classification criteria of Division 6.1, provided there is no free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the packaging or transport unit is closed. For single packagings, each packaging must correspond to a design type that has passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level. This entry may not be used for solids containing a Packing Group I liquid.49 Mixtures of solids that are not subject to this subchapter and corrosive liquids may be transported under this entry without first applying the classification criteria of Class 8, provided there is no free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the packaging or transport unit is closed. For single packagings, each packaging must correspond to a design type that has passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level.50 Cases, cartridge, empty with primer which are made of metallic or plastic casings and meeting the classification criteria of Division 1.4 are not regulated for domestic transportation.51 This description applies to items previously described as ``Toy propellant devices, Class C'' and includes reloadable kits. Model rocket motors containing 30 grams or less propellant are classed as Division 1.4S and items containing more than 30 grams of propellant but not more than 62.5 grams of propellant are classed as Division 1.4C.52 This entry may only be used for substances that are too insensitive for acceptance into Class 1 (explosive) when tested in accordance with Test Series 2 in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part I (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).53 Packages of these materials must bear the subsidiary risk label, ``EXPLOSIVE'', and the subsidiary hazard class/division must be entered in parentheses immediately following the primary hazard class in the shipping description, unless otherwise provided in this subchapter or through an approval issued by the Associate Administrator, or the competent authority of the country of origin. A copy of the approval shall accompany the shipping papers.54 Maneb or maneb preparations not meeting the definition of Division 4.3 or any other hazard class are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter when transported by motor vehicle, rail car, or aircraft.55 This device must be approved in accordance with Sec. 173.56 of this subchapter by the Associate Administrator.56 A means to interrupt and prevent detonation of the detonator from initiating the detonating cord must be installed between each electric detonator and the detonating cord ends of the jet perforating guns before the charged jet perforating guns are offered for transportation.57 Maneb or Maneb preparations stabilized against self-heating need not be classified in Division 4.2 when it can be demonstrated by testing that a volume of 1 m\3\ of substance does not self-ignite and that the temperature at the center of the sample does not exceed 200 C, when the sample is maintained at a temperature of not less than 75 C [2 C for a period of 24 hours, in accordance with procedures set forth for testing self-heating materials in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).58 Aqueous solutions of Division 5.1 inorganic solid nitrate substances are considered as not meeting the criteria of Division 5.1 if the concentration of the substances in solution at the minimum temperature encountered in transport is not greater than 80% of the saturation limit.59 Ferrocerium, stabilized against corrosion, with a minimum iron content of 10 percent is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.61 A chemical oxygen generator is spent if its means of ignition and all or a part of its chemical contents have been expended.62 Oxygen generators (see Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) are not authorized for transportation under this entry.64 The group of alkali metals includes lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium.65 The group of alkaline earth metals includes magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium.66 Formulations of these substances containing not less than 30 percent non-volatile, non-flammable phlegmatizer are not subject to this subchapter.70 Black powder that has been classed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 173.56

of this subchapter may be reclassed and offered for domestic transportation as a Division 4.1 material if it is offered for transportation and transported in accordance with the limitations and packaging requirements of Sec. 173.170 of this subchapter.74 During transport, this material must be protected from direct sunshine and stored or kept in a cool and well-ventilated place, away from all sources of heat.78 This entry may not be used to describe compressed air which contains more than 23.5 percent oxygen. Compressed air containing greater than 23.5 percent oxygen must be shipped using the description ``Compressed gas, oxidizing, n.o.s., UN3156.''79 This entry may not be used for mixtures that meet the definition for oxidizing gas.81 Polychlorinated biphenyl items, as defined in 40 CFR 761.3, for which specification packagings are impractical, may be packaged in non-specification packagings meeting the general packaging requirements of subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter. Alternatively, the item itself may be used as a packaging if it meets the general packaging requirements of subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter.101 The name of the particular substance or article must be specified.102 The ends of the detonating cord must be tied fast so that the explosive cannot escape. The articles may be transported as in Division 1.4 Compatibility Group D (1.4D) if all of the conditions specified in Sec. 173.63(a) of this subchapter are met.103 Detonators which will not mass detonate and undergo only limited propagation in the shipping package may be assigned to 1.4B classification code. Mass detonate means that more than 90 percent of the devices tested in a package explode practically simultaneously. Limited propagation means that if one detonator near the center of a shipping package is exploded, the aggregate weight of explosives, excluding ignition and delay charges, in this and all additional detonators in the outside packaging that explode may not exceed 25 grams.105 The word ``Agents'' may be used instead of ``Explosives'' when approved by the Associate Administrator.106 The recognized name of the particular explosive may be specified in addition to the type.107 The classification of the substance is expected to vary especially with the particle size and packaging but the border lines have not been experimentally determined; appropriate classifications should be verified following the test procedures in Secs. 173.57 and 173.58 of this subchapter.108 Fireworks must be so constructed and packaged that loose pyrotechnic composition will not be present in packages during transportation.109 Rocket motors must be nonpropulsive in transportation unless approved in accordance with Sec. 173.56 of this subchapter. A rocket motor to be considered ``nonpropulsive'' must be capable of unrestrained burning and must not appreciably move in any direction when ignited by any means.110 Fire extinguishers transported under UN1044 and oxygen cylinders transported for emergency use under UN1072 may include installed actuating cartridges (cartridges, power device of Division 1.4C or 1.4S), without changing the classification of Division 2.2, provided the aggregate quantity of deflagrating (propellant) explosives does not exceed 3.2 grams per cylinder. Oxygen cylinders with installed actuating cartridges as prepared for transportation must have an effective means of preventing inadvertent activation.111 Explosive substances of Division 1.1 Compatibility Group A (1.1A) are forbidden for transportation if dry or not desensitized, unless incorporated in a device.113 The sample must be given a tentative approval by an agency or laboratory in accordance with Sec. 173.56 of this subchapter.114 Jet perforating guns, charged, oil well, without detonator may be reclassed to Division 1.4 Compatibility Group D (1.4D) if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0">a. The total weight of the explosive contents of the shaped charges assembled in the guns does not exceed 90.5 kg (200 pounds) per vehicle; and</p><p class="depth0">b. The guns are packaged in accordance with Packing Method US 1 as specified in Sec. 173.62 of this subchapter.115 Boosters with detonator, detonator assemblies and boosters with detonators in which the total explosive charge per unit does not exceed 25 g, and which will not mass detonate and undergo only limited propagation in the shipping package may be assigned to 1.4B classification code. Mass detonate means more than 90 percent of the devices tested in a package explode practically simultaneously. Limited propagation means that if one booster near the center of the package is exploded, the aggregate weight of explosives, excluding ignition and delay charges, in this and all additional boosters in the outside packaging that explode may not exceed 25 g.116 Fuzes, detonating may be classed in Division 1.4 if the fuzes do not contain more than 25 g of explosive per fuze and are made and packaged so that they will not cause functioning of other fuzes, explosives or other explosive devices if one of the fuzes detonates in a shipping packaging or in adjacent packages.117 If shipment of the explosive substance is to take place at a time that freezing

weather is anticipated, the water contained in the explosive substance must be mixed with denatured alcohol so that freezing will not occur.118 This substance may not be transported under the provisions of Division 4.1 unless specifically authorized by the Associate Administrator (see UN0143 or UN0150 as appropriate).119 This substance, when in quantities of not more than 11.5 kg (25.3 pounds), with not less than 10 percent water, by mass, also may be classed as Division 4.1, provided a negative test result is obtained when tested in accordance with test series 6(c) of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).120 The phlegmatized substance must be significantly less sensitive than dry PETN.121 This substance, when containing less alcohol, water or phlegmatizer than specified, may not be transported unless approved by the Associate Administrator.123 Any explosives, blasting, type C containing chlorates must be segregated from explosives containing ammonium nitrate or other ammonium salts.125 Lactose or glucose or similar materials may be used as a phlegmatizer provided that the substance contains not less than 90%, by mass, of phlegmatizer. These mixtures may be classified in Division 4.1 when tested in accordance with test series 6(c) of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter) and approved by the Associate Administrator. Testing must be conducted on at least three packages as prepared for transport. Mixtures containing at least 98%, by mass, of phlegmatizer are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter. Packages containing mixtures with not less than 90% by mass, of phlegmatizer need not bear a POISON subsidiary risk label.127 Mixtures containing oxidizing and organic materials transported under this entry may not meet the definition and criteria of a Class 1 material. (See Sec. 173.50 of this subchapter.)128 Regardless of the provisions of Sec. 172.101(c)(12), aluminum smelting by-products and aluminum remelting by-products described under this entry, meeting the definition of Class 8, Packing Group II and III may be classed as a Division 4.3 material and transported under this entry. The presence of a Class 8 hazard must be communicated as required by this part for subsidiary hazards.129 These materials may not be classified and transported unless authorized by the Associate Administrator on the basis of results from Series 2 Test and a Series 6(c) Test from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter) on packages as prepared for transport. The packing group assignment and packaging must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety on the basis of the criteria in Sec. 173.21 of this subchapter and the package type used for the Series 6(c) test.130 ``Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.,'' commonly referred to as dry batteries, are hermetically sealed and generally utilize metals (other than lead) and/or carbon as electrodes. These batteries are typically used for portable power applications. The rechargeable (and some non-rechargeable) types have gelled alkaline electrolytes (rather than acidic) making it difficult for them to generate hydrogen or oxygen when overcharged and therefore, differentiating them from non-spillable batteries. Dry batteries specifically covered by another entry in the Sec. 172.101 Table must be transported in accordance with the requirements applicable to that entry. For example, nickel-metal hydride batteries transported by vessel in certain quantities are covered by another entry (see Batteries, nickel-metal hydride, UN3496). Dry batteries not specifically covered by another entry in the Sec. 172.101 Table are covered by this entry (i.e., Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.) and are not subject to requirements of this subchapter except for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Incident reporting. For transportation by aircraft, a telephone report in accordance with Sec. 171.15(a) is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous evolution of heat (i.e., an amount of heat sufficient to be dangerous to packaging or personal safety to include charring of packaging, melting of packaging, scorching of packaging, or other evidence) occurs as a direct result of a dry battery. For all modes of transportation, a written report submitted, retained, and updated in accordance with Sec. 171.16 is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous evolution of heat occurs as a direct result of a dry battery or battery-powered device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Preparation for transport. Batteries and battery-powered device(s) containing batteries must be prepared and packaged for transport in a manner to prevent:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A dangerous evolution of heat;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Short circuits, including but not limited to the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Packaging each battery or each battery-powered device when practicable, in fully enclosed inner packagings made of non-conductive material;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separating or packaging batteries in a manner to prevent contact with other batteries, devices or conductive materials (e.g., metal) in the packagings; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensuring exposed terminals or connectors are protected with non-conductive caps, non-conductive tape, or by other appropriate means; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Damage to terminals. If not impact resistant, the outer packaging should not be used as the sole means of protecting the battery terminals from damage or short circuiting. Batteries must be securely cushioned and packed to prevent shifting which could loosen terminal caps or reorient the terminals to produce short circuits. Batteries contained in devices must be securely installed. Terminal protection methods include but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Securely attaching covers of sufficient strength to protect the terminals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Packaging the battery in a rigid plastic packaging; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Constructing the battery with terminals that are recessed or otherwise protected so that the terminals will not be subjected to damage if the package is dropped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Additional air transport requirements. For a battery whose voltage (electrical potential) exceeds 9 volts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When contained in a device, the device must be packaged in a manner that prevents unintentional activation or must have an independent means of preventing unintentional activation (e.g., packaging restricts access to activation switch, switch caps or locks, recessed switches, trigger locks, temperature sensitive circuit breakers, etc.); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An indication of compliance with this special provision must be provided by marking each package with the words ``not restricted'' or by including the words ``not restricted'' on a transport document such as an air waybill accompanying the shipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Used or spent battery exception.
