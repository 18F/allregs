It is further determined to be improper that such interested persons or any member of the Administration's staff or the presiding officer directly or indirectly give statements to the press or radio, by paid advertisements or otherwise, designed to influence the Administration's judgment in the matter. In addition, it is further determined to be improper that any person solicit communications to the Administration or any of its members, its staff or the presiding officer in the case other than by counsel of record who shall serve copies thereof on all other parties to the proceeding.</p>
