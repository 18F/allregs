                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A party is entitled to present the party's case or  defense by oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, to submit  rebuttal evidence, and to conduct any cross-examination that may be  required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Admissibility. A party may introduce any oral, documentary, or  demonstrative evidence in support of the party's case or defense. The  ALJ must admit any oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence  introduced by a party, but must exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or  unduly repetitious evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings  governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is  hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its  admissibility.</p>
