                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before a motor carrier of property or passengers begins  interstate operations, it must register with FMCSA and receive a USDOT  Number. In addition, for-hire motor carriers must obtain operating  authority from FMCSA, unless exclusively providing transportation exempt  from the commercial registration requirements in 49 U.S.C. chapter 139.  Both the USDOT Number and operating authority are obtained by following  registration procedures described in 49 CFR part 390, subpart E. Part  365 of this chapter provides detailed instructions for obtaining  operating authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart applies to motor carriers domiciled in the United  States and Canada.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The regulations in this subpart do not apply to a Mexico- domiciled motor carrier. A Mexico-domiciled motor carrier of property or  passengers must register with FMCSA by following the registration  procedures described in 49 CFR parts 365, 368 and 390. Parts 365 (for  long-haul carriers) and 368 (for commercial zone carriers) of this  chapter provide detailed information about how a Mexico-domiciled motor  carrier may obtain operating authority.</p>
