                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Under section 993(e), a foreign  corporation is a related foreign export corporation with respect to a  DISC if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is a foreign international sales corporation described in  paragraph (b) of this section,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is a real property holding company described in paragraph  (c) of this section, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is an associated foreign corporation described in paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of this section. It is necessary to determine  whether a foreign corporation is a related foreign export corporation  with respect to a DISC for the following two purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Qualified export assets. Under Sec. 1.993-2(g), the stock or  securities of a related foreign export corporation held by the DISC are  qualified export assets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Qualified export receipts. Under Sec. 1.993-1 (e), (f), and  (g), certain receipts of the DISC with respect to stock or securities of  a related foreign export corporation held by the DISC are qualified  export receipts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foreign international sales corporation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  foreign corporation is a foreign international sales corporation with  respect to a taxable year of a DISC if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On each day during such taxable year of the DISC on which the  foreign corporation has stock issued and outstanding, the DISC owns  directly stock of the foreign corporation possessing more than 50  percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of  the foreign corporation entitled to vote as determined under the  principles of Sec. 1.957-1(b) (relating to definition of controlled  foreign corporation),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 95 percent or more of such foreign corporation's gross receipts  (as defined in Sec. 1.993-6) for its taxable year ending with or within  such taxable year of the DISC consists of qualified export receipts  described in Sec. 1.993-1 (b) through (e) or interest described in  Sec. 1.993-1(g) derived from any obligations described in Sec. 1.993-2  (d) or (e), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sum of the adjusted bases of the assets of the foreign  corporation which are qualified export assets described in Sec. 1.993-2  (b) through (e) and which are held by the foreign corporation at the  close of its taxable year which ends with or within such taxable year of  the DISC equals or exceeds 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases  of all assets held by the foreign corporation at the close of such  taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain determinations. The determinations as to whether gross  receipts are qualified export receipts described in subparagraph (1)(ii)  of this paragraph and as to whether assets are qualified export assets  described in subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph are made by  applying the requirements of Secs. 1.993-1 and 1.993-2 to the foreign  corporation as if it were a domestic corporation being tested to  determine whether it is a DISC. For purposes of making either of such  determinations, the principles of accounting applicable for purposes of  computing earnings and profits under Sec. 1.964-1 (relating to a  controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits) shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Real property holding company--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A foreign  corporation is a real property holding company with respect to a taxable  year of a DISC if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On each day during such taxable year of the DISC on which the  foreign corporation has stock issued and outstanding, the DISC owns  directly stock of the foreign corporation possessing more than 50  percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of  the foreign corporation entitled to vote as determined under the  principles of Sec. 1.957-1(b) and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sole function of the foreign corporation is to hold title  to real property situated outside the United States for the exclusive  use of the DISC, title to which may not be held by the DISC (and, if the  DISC subleases such property to a related supplier, as described in  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, by such related supplier) under the  law of the country in which such property is situated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activities of the foreign corporation. For purposes of  subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, a foreign corporation which  holds title to real property situated outside the United States may also  perform activities with respect to such property (such as management,  maintenance, and payment of taxes) which are ancillary to its function  of holding title to such property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusive use by the DISC. Real property held by the foreign  corporation must be used exclusively by the DISC whether under a lease  or any other arrangement. Real property is not so used by the DISC if  the DISC subleases such property to any other person. If, however,  during a taxable year of the DISC--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 90 percent or more of the qualified export receipts of the DISC  for such year are derived from transactions with respect to which it is  a commission agent for a related supplier (as defined in Sec. 1.994- 1(a)(3)(ii)), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The DISC subleases such property to such related supplier  then such property will be considered as used exclusively by the DISC  during such year if such related supplier does not sublease such  property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Associated foreign corporation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A foreign  corporation is an associated foreign corporation with respect to a  taxable year of the DISC if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On each day during such taxable year of the DISC on which the  foreign corporation has stock issued and outstanding, the DISC, or one  or more members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined  in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) as the DISC, owns (within the  meaning of section 1563 (d) and (e)) stock of the foreign corporation  possessing less than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of  all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote, as  determined under the principles of Sec. 1.957-1(b), or owns no stock of  such corporation, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ownership of stock, or of securities (as defined in  Sec. 1.993-2(g)), of the foreign corporation by the DISC or by one or  more members of such controlled group of corporations reasonably  furthers a transaction or transactions giving rise to qualified export  receipts for the DISC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Controlled group of corporations. For purposes of this  paragraph, the term ``controlled group of corporations'' has the same  meaning assigned to the term in section 1563(a) and not section  993(a)(3) and Sec. 1.993-1(k). Thus, for purposes of this paragraph, the  test of control is 80 percent control and, since the rules of section  1563(b) apply, only domestic members are considered to be members of the  controlled group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Furtherance of qualified export receipts. Ownership of stock or  securities of a foreign corporation will be considered as reasonably  furthering a transaction or transactions giving rise to qualified export  receipts for a DISC if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The ownership is necessary to obtain or maintain the foreign  corporation as a customer of the DISC or of a related supplier, as  defined in Sec. 1.994-1(a)(3)(ii) of the DISC or to aid the sales  distribution system of the DISC or of such related supplier, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the investment in the foreign corporation bears a  reasonable relationship to the amount of the DISC's annual net profit  from transactions in its trade or business which it may reasonably  expect to derive on account of such ownership.  In determining whether the amount of the investment is reasonable, there   shall be taken into account any stock or securities of the foreign  corporation owned by any other foreign corporation which, if it were a  domestic corporation, would be a member of the same controlled group of  corporations as the DISC.
