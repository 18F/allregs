                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator shall use the following methods, which are found in appendices A-1 through A-4 to part 60 of this chapter, to conduct the following tests: Monitoring system tests

for certification or recertification of continuous emission monitoring Systems; NOX emission tests of low mass emission units under Sec. 75.19(c)(1)(iv); NOX emission tests of excepted monitoring systems under appendix E to this part; and required quality assurance and quality control tests:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Methods 1 or 1A are the reference methods for selection of sampling site and sample traverses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 2 or its allowable alternatives, as provided in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, except for Methods 2B and 2E, are the reference methods for determination of volumetric flow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Methods 3, 3A, or 3B are the reference methods for the determination of the dry molecular weight O2 and CO2 concentrations in the emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method 4 (either the standard procedure described in section 8.1 of the method or the moisture approximation procedure described in section 8.2 of the method) shall be used to correct pollutant concentrations from a dry basis to a wet basis (or from a wet basis to a dry basis) and shall be used when relative accuracy test audits of continuous moisture monitoring systems are conducted. For the purpose of determining the stack gas molecular weight, however, the alternative wet bulb-dry bulb technique for approximating the stack gas moisture content described in section 2.2 of Method 4 may be used in lieu of the procedures in sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Methods 6, 6A, 6B or 6C, and 7, 7A, 7C, 7D or 7E in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter, as applicable, are the reference methods for determining SO2 and NOX pollutant concentrations. (Methods 6A and 6B in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter may also be used to determine SO2 emission rate in lb/mmBtu.) Methods 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter must be used to measure total NOX emissions, both NO and NO2, for purposes of this part. The owner or operator shall not use the following sections, exceptions, and options of method 7E in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 7.1 of the method allowing for use of prepared calibration gas mixtures that are produced in accordance with method 205 in Appendix M of 40 CFR Part 51;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sampling point selection procedures in section 8.1 of the method, for the emission testing of boilers and combustion turbines under appendix E to this part. The number and location of the sampling points for those applications shall be as specified in sections 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2 of appendix E to this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (3) in section 8.4 of the method allowing for the use of a multi-hole probe to satisfy the multipoint traverse requirement of the method;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Section 8.6 of the method allowing for the use of ``Dynamic Spiking'' as an alternative to the interference and system bias checks of the method. Dynamic spiking may be conducted (optionally) as an additional quality assurance check; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That portion of Section 8.5 of the method allowing multiple sampling runs to be conducted before performing the post-run system bias check or system calibration error check.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Method 3A in appendix A-2 and method 7E in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter are the reference methods for determining NOX and diluent emissions from stationary gas turbines for testing under appendix E to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator may use any of the following methods, which are found in appendices A-1 through A-4 to part 60 of this chapter, as a reference method backup monitoring system to provide quality-assured monitor data:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method 3A for determining O2 or CO2 concentration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Method 6C for determining SO2 concentration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Method 7E for determining total NOX concentration (both NO and NO2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method 2, or its allowable alternatives, as provided in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, except for Methods 2B and 2E, for determining volumetric flow.

gases as defined in section 5 of appendix A to this part.
