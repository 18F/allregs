                            <p class="depth0">The person designated to conduct a section 10(c) investigation shall  have the power, among other things, to administer oaths and  affirmations, to take and preserve testimony under oath, to issue  subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum and to apply for their enforcement  to the United States District Court for the judicial district or the  United States court in any territory in which the main office of the  bank, institution, or affiliate is located or in which the witness  resides or conducts business. The person conducting the investigation  may obtain the assistance of counsel or others from both within and  outside the FDIC. The persons who issue the order of investigation may  limit, quash, or modify any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum,   upon application and for good cause shown. The person conducting an  investigation may report to the Board of Directors any instance where  any attorney has been guilty of contemptuous conduct. The Board of  Directors, upon motion of the person conducting the investigation, or on  its own motion, may make a finding of contempt and may then summarily  suspend, without a hearing, any attorney representing a witness from  further participation in the investigation.</p>
