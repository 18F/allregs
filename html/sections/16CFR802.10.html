                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The acquisition of voting securities pursuant to a stock split or pro rata stock dividend is exempt from the requirements of the Act under section 7A(c)(10).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An acquisition of non-corporate interests or voting securities as a result of the conversion of a corporation or unincorporated entity into a new entity is exempt from the requirements of the Act if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No new assets will be contributed to the new entity as a result of the conversion; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As a result of the transaction the acquiring person does not increase its per centum holdings in the new entity relative to its per centum holdings in the original entity; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The acquiring person controlled the original entity.</p><p class="depth4">Examples: 1. Partners A and B hold 60 percent and 40 percent respectively of the partnership interests in C. C is converted to a corporation in which A and B hold 60 percent and 40 percent respectively of the voting securities. No new assets are contributed. The conversion to a corporation is exempt from notification for both A and B.</p><p class="depth4">2. Shareholder A holds 55% and B holds 45% of the voting securities of corporation C. C is converted to a limited liability company in which A holds 60% and B holds 40% of the membership interests. No new assets are contributed. The conversion to a limited liability company is exempt from notification because A controlled the corporation. If however, B holds 55% and A holds 45% in the new limited liability company, the conversion is not exempt for B and may require notification because control changes.</p><p class="depth4">3. Shareholders A, B and C each hold one third of the voting securities of corporation X. Pursuant to a reorganization agreement, A and B each contribute new assets to X and C contributes cash. X is then being reincorporated in a new state. Each of A, B and C receive one third of the voting securities of newly reincorporated C. The reincorporation is not exempt from notification and may be reportable for A, B and C because of the contribution of new assets.
