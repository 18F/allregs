If the Superintendent's review determines the proposal does not conform, the Superintendent shall inform the applicant/landowner and appropriate zoning authority that should the proposed use or development proceed, the National Park Service may seek to enjoin the development and acquire the property by condemnation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Superintendent may also appeal the decision of the zoning authority pursuant to procedures of local law.</p>
