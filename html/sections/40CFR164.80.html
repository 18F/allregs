In the case of the denial of an application for  registration, the applicant shall have the burden of going forward. In  the case of a hearing called by the Administrator, the Respondent has  the burden of going forward to present an affirmative case as to the  statement of issues. The party having the burden of going forward shall  have the opportunity to submit evidence on rebuttal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On all issues arising in connection with the hearing, the  ultimate burden of persuasion shall rest with the proponent of the  registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any party, other than Respondent, after being duly notified,  fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized  the Administrative Law Judge to dismiss the proceeding with or without  prejudice, as the Administrative Law Judge may determine, unless a  motion excusing the failure to appear has been made and granted. In the  event that a party appears at the hearing and no representative of the  Agency appears, the Administrative Law Judge shall proceed ex parte to  hear the evidence of the party: Provided, That failure on the part of  Respondent to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of  Respondent's right to file proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law  and orders, to be served with a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's  initial or accelerated decision, and to file exceptions with and to  submit argument before the Administrator with respect thereto.</p>
