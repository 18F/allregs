The term ``payment'' or ``allotment'' means an amount provided under part B or C of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill or Rights Act of 2000. This term includes Federal funds provided under the Act irrespective of whether the State must match the Federal portion of the expenditure. This term shall include funds previously covered by the terms ``Federal financial participation,'' ``the State's total allotment,'' ``further payments,'' ``payments,'' ``allotment'' and ``Federal funds.''</p><p class="depth0">Presiding officer. The term ``presiding officer'' means anyone designated by the Secretary to conduct any hearing held under this subpart. The term includes the Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, if the Secretary or his or her designee presides over the hearing. For purposes of this subpart the Secretary's ``designee'' refers to a person, such as the Administrator of ACL, who has been delegated broad authority to carry out all or some of the authorizing statute. The term designee does not refer to a presiding officer designated only to conduct a particular hearing or hearings.</p>
