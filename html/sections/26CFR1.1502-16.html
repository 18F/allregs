                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 617--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the aggregate amount of the  expenditures to which section 617(a) applies, paid or incurred with  respect to mines or deposits located outside the United States (as  defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder), does not exceed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $400,000 minus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All amounts deducted or deferred during the taxable year and  all preceding taxable years under section 617 or section 615 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939 by corporations which are members of the group during the  taxable year (and individuals or corporations which have transferred any  mineral property to any such member within the meaning of section  617(g)(2)(B)) for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950 and prior  to the taxable year, then the deduction under section 617 with respect  to such foreign expenditures and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-12 for  each member shall be no greater than an allocable   portion of such amount hereinafter referred to as the ``consolidated  foreign exploration limitation.'' Such allocable portion shall be  determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If the amount of  such expenditures exceeds the consolidated foreign exploration  limitation, no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such excess.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocable portion of limitation.

If the aggregate amount of the  expenditures, to which section 615(a) applies, which are paid or  incurred by the members of the group during any consolidated return year  exceeds the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $100,000, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $400,000 minus all such expenditures deducted (or deferred) by  corporations which are members of the group during the taxable year (and  individuals or corporations which have transferred any mineral property  to any such member within the meaning of section 615(c)(2)(B)) for  taxable years ending after December 31, 1950, and prior to the taxable  year, then the deduction (or amount deferrable) under section 615 and  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.1502-12 for each member shall be no greater than  an allocable portion of such lesser amount, hereinafter referred to as  the ``consolidated exploration limitation''.

The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X and its wholly owned subsidiaries,  corporations Y and Z, file a consolidated return for the calendar year  1971. None of the corporations have incurred exploration expenditures  described in section 617 in previous years. During 1971, X   incurred foreign exploration expenditures of $30,000, Y of $20,000, and  Z of $40,000. The amount of foreign exploration expenditures deductible  under section 617 for purposes of computing separate taxable income  under Sec. 1.1502-12 will be the amount actually expended by each  corporation.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that prior  to 1971, X, Y, and Z had deducted (or deferred) under section 615 and  617 a total of $300,000 of exploration expenditures. During 1971, with  respect to deposits located outside the United States X incurred  exploration expenditures of $25,000, Y of $75,000, and Z of $125,000.  The consolidated exploration limitation under paragraph (a) of this  section with respect to the foreign deposits (there is no limitation  with respect to the domestic expenditures) is $100,000. X may allocate  the $100,000 in any manner among the three members, except that X may  not be allocated more than $25,000 nor Y more than $75,000, the amount  actually expended by X and Y and which they could have deducted had they  each filed a separate return. If the allocation is not made in  accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the $100,000  limitation will be allocated under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section  as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Allocable</p><p class="depth2">Corporation                         Expenditure    Fraction      Limitation       portion ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">..............      25,000 X.....................................................         $25,000  ----------  x    $100,000  =     $12,500</p><p class="depth2">..............     200,000</p><p class="depth2">..............      75,000 Y.....................................................         $75,000  ----------  x    $100,000  =     $37,500</p><p class="depth2">..............     200,000</p><p class="depth2">..............     100,000 Z.....................................................        $125,000  ----------  x    $100,000  =     $50,000</p><p class="depth2">..............     200,000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The denominator of $200,000 was calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth2">X=$25,000</p><p class="depth2">Y=$75,000</p><p class="depth2">Z=$100,000 (maximum amount allowed if filed separately) Total $200,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2) and that on  January 1, 1971, X acquired all of the stock of corporation T which  prior to its taxable year beginning January 1, 1971, had previously  deducted (or deferred) $310,000 of exploration expenditures. Assume  further that in 1971 X incurred $25,000 of foreign exploration  expenditures, Y $50,000, T $50,000, and Z none. A consolidated return is  filed for 1971. None of the expenditures may be deducted under section  617 since the consolidated exploration limitation is zero. The  limitation is zero since the aggregate amount of previously deducted (or  deferred) exploration expenditures by the members of the group exceeds  $400,000. (The total of such expenditures is $410,000, of which $310,000  is attributable to T and, assuming the allocation of the limitation in  example (2) is made under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, $12,500  is attributable to X, $37,500 to Y, and $50,000 to Z.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (3) except that on  December 31, 1971, X sold all of the stock in Z to an unrelated party.  The consolidated exploration limitation for 1972 will be $40,000,  computed by subtracting from $400,000, the aggregate amount of  previously deducted (or deferred) exploration expenditures incurred by  the members of the group prior to 1972. (The total of such expenditures  is $360,000, of which $12,500 is attributable to X, $37,500 to Y and  $310,000 to T.) Amounts previously deducted (or deferred) by Z are not  taken into account since it was not a member of the group at any time  during 1972. Amounts previously deducted (or deferred) by Z shall be  taken into account by it for subsequent separate return years.  [T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12949, June 30, 1972]</p>
