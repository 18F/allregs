                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Label design. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Label design shall consist of either of the  following specifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The label shall consist of a white rectangular background,  approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters) high by 18 inches (45  centimeters) wide, with ``CLEAN AIR VEHICLE'' printed in contrasting  block capital letters at least 4.3 inches (10.6 centimeters) tall and  1.8 inches (4.4 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.5  inches (1.3 centimeters). In addition, the words ``INHERENTLY LOW- EMISSION VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering no smaller than 1 inch  (2.5 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which  impairs readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification  number; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The label shall consist of a white truncated-circular  background, approximately 10 inches (25 centimeters) in diameter by 7  inches (17.5 centimeters) in height. The bottom edge of the truncated- circular background shall be approximately 2 inches (5 centimeters) from  the center. The acronym ``ILEV'' shall be printed on the label in  contrasting block capital letters at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) tall  and 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than  0.4 inches (1.0 centimeter). In addition, the words ``CLEAN AIR  VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering no smaller than 0.8 inches (2.0  centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs  readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ILEV label shall be fabricated or affixed to a vehicle in  such a manner that its removal from the vehicle cannot be accomplished  without defacing or destroying the label in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Along with the manufacturer's application to certify a  particular ILEV engine class, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's  agent shall submit to EPA ILEV labels or reasonable facsimiles of the  types which may be mounted on a certified ILEV vehicle of that class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. Vehicle manufacturers or their agents must install  ILEV labels on a certified ILEV vehicle at the time of its sale to an  eligible fleet owner if the vehicle is to be eligible for expanded TCM  exemptions. An eligible fleet owner is one who is in a covered area and  owns a total of at least ten motor vehicles (including the ILEV(s) being  purchased) which operate in the owner's fleet. All of the following  shall be provided to demonstrate eligibility: Photocopies of no less  than nine motor vehicle registrations indicating registration in the  ILEV purchaser's name, a signed statement by the ILEV purchaser that  these vehicles are operational in the purchaser's fleet and that the  ILEV being purchased will also be operated in this fleet, and a signed  statement by the ILEV purchaser that the ILEV labels will be removed and  disposed of when the vehicle is sold, given, leased (except as part of a  daily rental fleet), or offered for long-term loan to someone who has  not demonstrated eligibility for expanded TCMs available to ILEVs  according to these criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ILEV Label installation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided for in this  paragraph (c), no person shall attach an ILEV label or any facsimile of  an ILEV label to any vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall attach  three labels on the vehicle in plain sight: One on the rear of the  vehicle and one on each of two sides of the vehicle. Each label shall  conform to the specifications of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case that an ILEV label of the proportions specified in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section cannot be attached to the rear of the  ILEV, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall attach to the  rear of the vehicle an ILEV label of either of the following  proportions:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The label shall consist of a white rectangular background,  approximately 4 inches (10 centimeters) high by 24 inches (60  centimeters) wide, with ``CLEAN AIR VEHICLE'' printed in contrasting  block capital letters at least 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) tall and 1.3  inches (3.3 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.3  inches (0.8 centimeter). In addition, the words ``INHERENTLY LOW- EMISSION VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering   no smaller than 0.6 inches (1.5 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be  added to the label which impairs readability. Labels shall include a  serialized identification number; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The label shall consist of a white truncated-circular  background, approximately 5 inches (12.5 centimeters) in diameter by 3.5  inches (8.8 centimeters) in height. The bottom edge of the truncated- circular background shall be approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from  the center. The acronym ``ILEV'' shall be printed on the label in  contrasting block capital letters at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tall  and 0.8 inches (2.0 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than  0.3 inches (0.8 centimeters). In addition, the words ``CLEAN AIR  VEHICLE'' must be present in lettering no smaller than 0.4 inches (1.0  centimeter) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs  readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Label removal. Fleet ILEV owners shall remove and dispose of the  ILEV labels on a vehicle before selling or transferring ownership of an  ILEV or offering it for lease (unless the ILEV is part of a daily rental  fleet) or long-term loan. This provision shall not apply if the person  who is receiving the vehicle demonstrates eligibility for expanded TCM  exemptions under the federal ILEV program as described in paragraph (b)  of this section, or is otherwise qualified under state regulations which  expressly expand ILEV label eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Label replacement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer shall make replacement  ILEV labels available to the fleet owner of a qualifying ILEV to replace  any ILEV label which has been lost or removed due to vehicle damage,  repair, sale, or lease. The fleet owner's request shall include proof of  ownership of the ILEV in question and proof of the fleet owner's  eligibility for ILEV TCM exemptions, as outlined in paragraph (c) of  this section. Each label shall be imprinted with the same serial number  as initially assigned to the damaged/missing ILEV label(s) for that  vehicle. Any portion of a damaged label remaining on the ILEV shall be  removed from the vehicle and submitted with the request as proof of  loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon receipt of the replacement ILEV label(s), the fleet owner  shall attach the new ILEV label(s) only to the vehicle for which  replacement ILEV label(s) were requested.
