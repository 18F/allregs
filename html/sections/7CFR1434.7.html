If the honey located in a farm  storage structure is pledged as collateral that secures more than one  loan, the honey must be segregated so as to preserve the identity of the  honey securing such loan. Honey securing a loan must also be segregated  from any honey not pledged as collateral for a loan that is stored in  the same structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Producers may also obtain loans on honey packed in eligible  containers and stored in facilities owned by third parties in which the  honey of more than one person is stored if the honey that is to be  pledged as collateral for a loan and that is stored identity preserved  or is segregated from all other honey. Each container of the segregated  quantity of honey shall be marked with the producer's name, loan number,  and lot number so as to identify the honey from other honey stored in  the structure.</p>
