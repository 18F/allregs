performance tests have been completed, as specified in Sec. 63.4760. This requirement does not apply to a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to Sec. 63.4761(j) in lieu of conducting performance tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If your affected source uses an emission capture system and add-on control device, you must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (SSMP) according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). The SSMP must address startup, shutdown, and corrective actions in the event of a malfunction of the emission capture system or the add-on control device. The SSMP must also address any coating operation equipment that may cause increased emissions or that would affect capture efficiency if the process equipment malfunctions, such as conveyors that move parts among enclosures.
