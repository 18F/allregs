                            <p class="depth0">Broadcast stations may be operated as either attended (where a designated person is responsible for the proper operation of the transmitting apparatus either at the transmitter site, a remote control point or an ATS control point) or unattended (where highly stable equipment or automated monitoring of station operating parameters is employed). No prior FCC approval is required to operate a station in the unattended mode. Regardless of which method of station operation is employed, licensees must employ procedures which will ensure compliance with Part 11 of this chapter, the rules governing the Emergency Alert System (EAS).
