The Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish procedures for providing benefits to certain individuals who sustained a covered injury as the direct result of the administration of the smallpox vaccine or other covered countermeasure, and to certain individuals who sustained a covered injury as the direct result of accidental vaccinia inoculation through contact with certain persons vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine or with individuals accidentally inoculated by them. Also, if the Secretary determines that an individual died as a result of a covered injury, the Act provides for certain survivors of that individual to receive death benefits.</p>
