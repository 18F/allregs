                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time and manner of compromise. Payment by the debtor of the amount that CMS has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a claim must be made within the time and in the manner prescribed by CMS. Accordingly, CMS will not settle a claim until the full payment of the compromise amount has been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effect of failure to pay compromise amount. Failure of the debtor to make payment, as provided by the compromise agreement, reinstates the full amount of the claim, less any amounts paid prior to the default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibition against grace periods. CMS will not agree to inclusion of a provision in an installment agreement that would permit grace periods for payments that are late under the terms of the agreement.</p>
