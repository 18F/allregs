                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identity--(1) Definition. Canned peas is the food prepared from fresh or frozen succulent seeds of the pea plant of the species Pisum sativum L. but excluding the subspecies macrocarpum. Only sweet wrinkled varieties, smooth-skin varieties, or hybrids thereof may be used. The product is packed with water or other suitable aqueous liquid medium to which may be added one or more of the other optional ingredients set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Such food is sealed in a container and, before or after sealing, is so processed by heat as to prevent spoilage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition.
