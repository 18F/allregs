                                Sec. 60-3.17  Policy statement on affirmative action (see section 13B).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council was established by act of Congress in 1972, and charged with responsibility for developing and implementing agreements and policies designed, among other things, to eliminate conflict and inconsistency among the agencies of the Federal Government responsible for administering Federal law prohibiting discrimination on grounds of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin. This statement is issued as an initial response to the requests of a number of State and local officials for clarification of the Government's policies concerning the role of affirmative action in the overall equal employment opportunity program. While the Coordinating Council's adoption of this statement expresses only the views of the signatory agencies concerning this important subject, the principles set forth below should serve as policy guidance for other Federal agencies as well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Equal employment opportunity is the law of the land. In the public sector of our society this means that all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin shall have equal access to positions in the public service limited only by their ability to do the job. There is ample evidence in all sectors of our society that such equal access frequently has been denied to members of certain groups because of their sex, racial, or ethnic characteristics. The remedy for such past and present discrimination is twofold.</p><p class="depth2">On the one hand, vigorous enforcement of the laws against discrimination is essential. But equally, and perhaps even more important are affirmative, voluntary efforts on the part of public employers to assure that positions in the public service are genuinely and equally accessible to qualified persons, without regard to their sex, racial, or ethnic characteristics. Without such efforts equal employment opportunity is no more than a wish. The importance of voluntary affirmative action on the part of employers is underscored by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246, and related laws and regulations--all of which emphasize voluntary action to achieve equal employment opportunity.</p><p class="depth2">As with most management objectives, a systematic plan based on sound organizational analysis and problem identification is crucial to the accomplishment of affirmative action objectives. For this reason, the Council urges all State and local governments to develop and implement results oriented affirmative action plans which deal with the problems so identified.</p><p class="depth2">The following paragraphs are intended to assist State and local governments by illustrating the kinds of analyses and activities which may be appropriate for a public employer's voluntary affirmative action plan. This statement does not address remedies imposed after a finding of unlawful discrimination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Voluntary affirmative action to assure equal employment opportunity is construction of any affirmative action plan should be an analysis of the employer's work force to determine whether precentages of sex, race, or ethnic groups in individual job classifications are substantially similar to the precentages of those groups available in the relevant job market who possess the basic job-related qualifications.</p><p class="depth2">When substantial disparities are found through such analyses, each element of the overall selection process should be examined to determine which elements operate to exclude persons on the basis of sex, race, or ethnic group. Such elements include, but are not limited to, recruitment, testing, ranking certification, interview, recommendations for selection, hiring, promotion, etc. The examination of each element of the selection process should at a minimum include a determination of its validity in predicting job performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> When an employer has reason to believe that its selection procedures have the exclusionary effect described in paragraph 2 of this section, it should initiate affirmative steps to remedy the situation. Such steps, which in design and execution may be race, color, sex, or ethnic ``conscious,'' include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(a)</em> The establishment of a long-term goal, and short-range, interim goals and timetables for the specific job classifications, all of which should take into account the availability of basically qualified persons in the relevant job market;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(b)</em> A recruitment program designed to attract qualified members of the group in question;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(c)</em> A systematic effort to organize work and redesign jobs in ways that provide opportunities for persons lacking ``journeyman'' level knowledge or skills to enter and, with appropriate training, to progress in a career field;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(d)</em> Revamping selection instruments or procedures which have not yet been validated in order to reduce or eliminate exclusionary effects on particular groups in particular job classifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(e)</em> The initiation of measures designed to assure that members of the affected group who are qualified to perform the job are included within the pool of persons from which the selecting official makes the selection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(f)</em> A systematic effort to provide career advancement training, both classroom and on-the-job, to employees locked into dead end jobs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(g)</em> The establishment of a system for regularly monitoring the effectiveness of the particular affirmative action program, and procedures for making timely adjustments in this program where effectiveness is not demonstrated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> The goal of any affirmative action plan should be achievement of genuine equal employment opportunity for all qualified persons. Selection under such plans should be based upon the ability

of the applicant(s) to do the work. Such plans should not require the selection of the unqualified, or the unneeded, nor should they require the selection of persons on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. Moreover, while the Council believes that this statement should serve to assist State and local employers, as well as Federal agencies, it recognizes that affirmative action cannot be viewed as a standardized program which must be accomplished in the same way at all times in all places.</p><p class="depth2">Accordingly, the Council has not attempted to set forth here either the minimum or maximum voluntary steps that employers may take to deal with their respective situations. Rather, the Council recognizes that under applicable authorities, State and local employers have flexibility to formulate affirmative action plans that are best suited to their particular situations. In this manner, the Council believes that affirmative action programs will best serve the goal of equal employment opportunity.</p><p class="depth2">Respectfully submitted,</p><p class="depth2">Harold R. Tyler, Jr.,Deputy Attorney General and Chairman of the Equal Employment Coordinating Council.</p><p class="depth2">Michael H. Moskow,Under Secretary of Labor.</p><p class="depth2">Ethel Bent Walsh,Acting Chairman, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p><p class="depth2">Robert E. Hampton,Chairman, Civil Service Commission.</p><p class="depth2">Arthur E. Flemming,Chairman, Commission on Civil Rights.</p><p class="depth2">Because of its equal employment opportunity responsibilities under the State and Local Government Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 (the revenue sharing act), the Department of Treasury was invited to participate in the formulation of this policy statement; and it concurs and joins in the adoption of this policy statement.
Done this 26th day of August 1976.</p><p class="depth2">Richard Albrecht,</p><p class="depth2">General Counsel,</p><p class="depth2">Department of the Treasury.</p>
