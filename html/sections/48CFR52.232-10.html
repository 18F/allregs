The  estimates, along with any supporting data required by the Contracting  Officer, shall be prepared by the Contractor and submitted along with  its voucher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government  shall pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or  authorized representative. The Contracting Officer shall require a  withholding from amounts due under paragraph (a) of this clause of up to  10 percent only if the Contracting Officer determines that such a  withholding is necessary to protect the Government's interest and ensure  satisfactory completion of the contract. The amount withheld shall be  determined based upon the Contractor's performance record under this  contract. Whenever the Contracting Officer determines that the work is  substantially complete and that the amount retained is in excess of the  amount adequate for the protection of the Government, the Contracting  Officer shall release the excess amount to the Contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon satisfactory completion by the Contractor and final  acceptance by the Contracting Officer of all the work done by the  Contractor under the ``Statement of Architect-Engineer Services'', the  Contractor will be paid the unpaid balance of any money due for work  under the statement, including all withheld amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Before final payment under the contract, or before settlement  upon termination of the contract, and as a condition precedent thereto,  the Contractor shall execute and deliver to the Contracting Officer a  release of all claims against the Government arising under or by virtue  of this contract, other than any claims that are specifically excepted  by the Contractor from the operation of the release in amounts stated in  the release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision in this contract, and  specifically paragraph (b) of this clause, progress payments shall not  exceed 80 percent on work accomplished on undefinitized contract  actions. A contract action is any action resulting in a contract, as  defined in FAR subpart 2.1, including contract modifications for  additional supplies or services, but not including contract  modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the  contract, such as contract   modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and  other administrative changes.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 50 FR 26904, June 28, 1985;  52 FR 30078, Aug. 12, 1987; 55 FR 38518, Sept. 18, 1990; 70 FR 43581,  July 27, 2005; 75 FR 13424, Mar. 19, 2010]</p>
