Only where the USPTO's Web site is unavailable for  publication will the USPTO publish the Notice of Complaint in the  Official Gazette and/or the Federal Register. The invention promoter  will be given 30 days from such notice to submit a reply to the Notice  of Complaint. If the USPTO does not receive a reply from the invention  promoter within 30 days, the complaint alone will become publicly  available.  [68 FR 9553, Feb. 28, 2003]</p>
