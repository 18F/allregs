                                Sec. 591.215  Where does OPM collect prices in the COLA and DC areas?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Survey areas. Each COLA area has one survey area, except Hawaii  County, HI, and the U.S. Virgin Islands COLA areas. Hawaii County has  two survey areas: the Hilo area and the Kailua Kona/Waimea area. The  U.S. Virgin Islands also has two survey areas: the Island of St. Croix  and the Islands of St. Thomas and St. John. The Washington, DC, area has  three survey areas: the District of Columbia, the Maryland suburbs of  the District of Columbia, and the Virginia suburbs of the District of  Columbia. OPM collects non-housing data throughout the survey area, and  for selected items such as golf, snow skiing, and air travel, OPM  collects non-housing data in additional geographic locations. OPM may  collect housing data throughout the survey area or in specific housing  data collection areas. The following table shows the survey areas:</p><p class="depth2">Survey Areas ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Survey areas and geographic</p><p class="depth2">COLA and reference areas                     coverage ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Anchorage..............................

OPM also may collect non-</p><p class="depth2">housing data from selected outlets in St. John.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rest of the State of Alaska COLA area. OPM may collect survey  data onsite, use alternative indicators of relative living costs (e.g.,  price and cost information published by the University of Alaska), or  both. If the use of alternative indicators would result in a COLA rate  reduction, OPM will conduct onsite surveys in one or more locations in  the Rest of the State of Alaska COLA area, before making a reduction, to  ensure that the reduction is warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining Survey Coverage. To aid OPM in determining survey  coverage, OPM may from time to time conduct surveys of Federal employees  in the COLA areas and/or the Washington, DC, area to determine where  employees shop and what they spend on certain goods or services and to  collect other information related to the price surveys and the  calculation of price indexes.
