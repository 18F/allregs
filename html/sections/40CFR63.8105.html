Flexible elephant trunk systems when used with closed vent systems and drawing ambient air (i.e., the system is not ducted, piped, or otherwise connected to the unit operations) away from operators when vessels are opened are not process vessel vents. Process vessel vents do not include vents on storage tanks, wastewater emission sources, or pieces of equipment subject to the requirements in Table 3 of this subpart.

A gas stream routed to a process for a process purpose is not a process vessel vent.</p><p class="depth0">Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an individual unit of equipment used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units.

A recovery device is considered part of the miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.</p><p class="depth0">Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth0">Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source, any process vessels within an affected source, or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart if steps taken to cease operation differ from those under routine procedures for removing the vessel or equipment from service. Shutdown also applies to the emptying and degassing of storage tanks.</p><p class="depth0">Small control device means a control device that controls total HAP emissions of less than 10 tpy, before control.</p><p class="depth0">Soluble HAP means the HAP listed in Table 8 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means the setting in operation of a new affected source. For new equipment added to an affected source, including equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, startup means the first time the equipment is put into operation. Startup includes the setting in operation of equipment any time the steps taken differ from routine procedures for putting the equipment into operation.</p><p class="depth0">Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store organic liquids that contain one or more HAP as raw material feedstocks or products. The following are not considered storage tanks for the purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, railcars, barges, or ships;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as impurities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Wastewater storage tanks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Process vessels.</p><p class="depth0">Total organic compounds or (TOC) means the total gaseous organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) in a vent stream.</p><p class="depth0">Wastewater storage tank means a stationary structure that is designed to contain an accumulation of wastewater and is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) which provide structural support.</p><p class="depth0">Wastewater stream means water that is discarded from miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations through a POD, and that contains an annual average concentration of total partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds of at least 1,600 ppmw at any flow rate.
