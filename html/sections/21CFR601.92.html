The notice, which will ordinarily be a letter, will state generally the reasons for the action and the proposed grounds for the order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Submission of data and information. (1) If the applicant fails to file a written request for a hearing within 15 days of receipt of the notice, the applicant waives the opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant files a timely request for a hearing, the agency will publish a notice of hearing in the Federal Register in accordance with Sec.

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs' decision constitutes final agency action from which the applicant may petition for judicial review. Before requesting an order from a court for a stay of action pending review, an applicant must first submit a petition for a stay of action under Sec. 10.35 of this chapter.
