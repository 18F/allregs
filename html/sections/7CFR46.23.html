                            <p class="depth0">Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when the  commodity has no commercial value or when it is dumped by order of a  local health officer or other authorized official or when the shipper  has specifically consented to such disposition. The term ``commercial  value'' means any value that a commodity may have for any purpose that  can be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence without unreasonable  expense or loss of time. When produce is being handled for or on behalf  of another person, proof as to the quantities of produce destroyed or  dumped in excess of five percent of the shipment shall be provided by  procuring an official certificate showing that the produce has no  commercial value from any person authorized by the Department to inspect  fruits and vegetables. Where such inspection service is not available  certification may be obtained from (a) any health officer or food  inspector of any State, county, parish, city or municipality or of the  District of Columbia; (b) any established commercial agency or service  making inspections for the fruit and vegetable industry; or (c) when no  inspector or health officer designated above is available consideration  will be given to other evidence such as inspection and certification  made by any two persons having no financial interest in the produce  involved or in the business of any person financially interested  therein, and who are unrelated by blood or marriage to any such  financially interested person, and who, at the time of the inspection  and certification, and for a period of at least one year immediately  prior thereto, have been engaged in the handling of the same general  kind or class of produce with respect to which the inspections and  certification are to be made. Any certificate issued by any persons  designated in paragraph (c) of this section shall include a statement  that each of them possesses the requisite qualifications. Any such  certificate shall properly identify the produce by showing the  commodity, lot number, brand or principal identifying marks on the  containers, quantity dumped, name and address of shipper, name and  address of applicant, condition of the produce, time, place, and date of  inspection and a statement that the produce possesses no commercial  value.</p><p class="depth0">Records of Retailers</p>
