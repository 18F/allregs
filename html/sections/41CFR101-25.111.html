                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> From time to time, Congress enacts legislation pertaining to the  protection and enhancement of the Nation's environment; e.g., the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321). The  objective of such legislation is, among other things, the improvement of  the relationship between people and their environment and the lessening  of hazards affecting their health and safety. It is the policy of the  General Services Administration to appropriately implement the various  provisions of these Acts of Congress as fully as statutory authority  permits in support of the national policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With respect to the procurement, management, and disposal of  personal property, the implementation of national environmental policy  is provided through amendments to the regulations of GSA, changes to  Federal specifications and standards documents, as appropriate, and  other actions as may be required when expediency is of prime importance.  Further, the Federal regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions  applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items supplied  through the Federal supply system that are known to contain components  or possess qualities that have an adverse impact on the environment or  that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Each  agency, therefore, shall take action as necessary to ensure that the  objectives and directives of the National Environmental Policy Act,  other environmental statutes, and applicable regulations are met;  especially the directive that environmental concerns, effects, and  values shall be given appropriate   consideration with economic and technical issues in decisionmaking.  Action should include a continuing review of the Federal Register and  issuances promulgated by the Federal regulatory agencies for guidance  applicable to the procurement, use, and disposal of items that are known  to contain components or to possess qualities that have an adverse  impact on the environment or that result in creating unsafe or unhealthy  working conditions.
