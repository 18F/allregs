Local interests shall agree to hold and save the United States free from claims that may occur from control operations and to participate to the extent of 30 per centum of the cost of such operations. Costs for research and planning undertaken pursuant to the authorities of this section shall be borne fully by the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There are authorized to be appropriated such amounts not in excess of $5,000,000 annually, as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

Appendix E to Part 273--Preventive Safety Measures in Handling of</p><p class="depth2">Herbicides</p><p class="depth2">1. Follow the label on each container before using the contents. The manufacturers are required by law to list recommendations and precautions.</p><p class="depth2">2. Weather conditions are important. Winds could carry toxic sprays and dusts to areas not under your control, causing accidental poisoning to the public or domestic animals.</p><p class="depth2">3. Smoking is not permitted while herbicides are being handled.</p><p class="depth2">4. All herbicides must be handled in well ventilated areas to minimize inhalation of toxic vapors.</p><p class="depth2">5. Shower and washing facilities must be near herbicides mixing areas.</p><p class="depth2">6. Any contamination of the skin, particularly with liquid concentrations or solutions, must be immediately washed off with detergent and water.</p><p class="depth2">7. Protective clothing is used in conjunction with respiratory protective devices to prevent skin contact and inhalation of herbicides. Recommended articles of protective clothing are rubber aprons, coveralls, chemical splash goggles, safety shoes and hard hats. A lightweight water and chemical resistant throw away type protective clothing that is impervious to herbicides is now available. In warm geographical areas this type of lightweight protective clothing would be beneficial in reducing physical stress to applicators. Additional protection is afforded by protective skin cream.</p><p class="depth2">8. Clothing contaminated by spillage must be removed immediately and thoroughly laundered before wearing. Special care is required to prevent contamination of the inside of gloves.</p><p class="depth2">9. Approved respirators must be worn while herbicides are being mixed, and when dusts or liquids are being handled or sprayed. Care should be exercised when selecting the respirator type to insure that it is designated specifically for the substance to be used. Each canister must be labeled and approved by the Bureau of Mines or HEW (NIOSH). Filters or canisters must be changed after 8 hours use and more often if odor of the herbicide is detected. (Always have extra cartridges available when needed.)</p><p class="depth2">10. Herbicide storage, mixing and formulation facilities.</p><p class="depth2">a. All herbicides must be stored in a dry, well ventilated, separate room, building or covered area not accessible to authorized personnel or the public and placed under lock and key.</p><p class="depth2">b. Identification signs should be placed on rooms, buildings, and fences to advise of the contents and warn of their hazardous nature.</p><p class="depth2">c. Where applicable, label the outside of each storage with the ``Danger,'' ``Poison,'' and ``Pesticide Storage'' signs.</p><p class="depth2">d. Fire extinguishers must be installed near door of material storage room. Diluted oil based herbicides are flammable and must be stored separate from other materials.</p><p class="depth2">e. All herbicide storage, mixing and formulation areas must have adequate ventilation in order to reduce inhalation of toxic vapors. Sparkproof lighting fixtures should be installed in closed storage areas to eliminate ignition hazards.</p><p class="depth2">11. Empty herbicide containers must be disposed of properly. Do not burn them. When herbicides or defoliants volatize, the resulting vapors may be poisonous to humans, and they may damage nearby plants, crops or shrubbery; also, herbicides or defoliants containing chlorates may be a serious fire hazard when heated.</p><p class="depth2">12. Glass herbicide containers should be disposed of by breaking. Chop holes in top, bottom, and sides of metal containers or crush them so they cannot collect water or be reused. After breaking or puncturing them, bury the containers at least 18 inches deep in an isolated area provided for this purpose, away from water supplies or high water tables. Records to locate such buried herbicides within the landfill site should be maintained. Post warning signs.</p><p class="depth2">13. Safety programs developed for the safe handling and mixing of toxic chemicals should be coordinated with the Safety Office prior to implementation.</p>
