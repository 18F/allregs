                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> will not apply to any  disclosure or use permitted under regulations prescribed by the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 7216 and Sec. Sec.  301.7216-1 through 301.7216-3:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tax return. The term tax return means any return (or amended  return) of income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tax return preparer--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term tax return  preparer means:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any person who is engaged in the business of preparing or  assisting in preparing tax returns;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any person who is engaged in the business of providing auxiliary  services in connection with the preparation of tax returns, including a  person who develops software that is used to prepare or file a tax  return and any Authorized IRS e-file Provider;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any person who is otherwise compensated for preparing, or  assisting in preparing, a tax return for any other person; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any individual who, as part of their duties of employment with  any person described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this  section performs services that assist in the preparation of, or assist  in providing auxiliary services in connection with the preparation of, a  tax return.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Business of preparing returns. A person is engaged in the  business of preparing tax returns as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)  of this section if, in the course of the person's business, the person  holds himself out to tax return preparers or taxpayers as a person who  prepares tax returns or assists in preparing tax returns, whether or not  tax return preparation is the person's sole business activity and  whether or not the person charges a fee for tax return preparation  services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Providing auxiliary services. A person is engaged in the  business of providing auxiliary services in connection with the  preparation of tax returns as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of  this section if, in the course of the person's business, the person  holds himself out to tax return preparers or to taxpayers as a person  who performs auxiliary services, whether or not providing the auxiliary  services is the person's sole business activity and whether or not the  person charges a fee for the auxiliary services. Likewise, a person is  engaged in the business of providing auxiliary services if, in the  course of the person's business, the person receives a taxpayer's tax  return information from another tax return preparer pursuant to the  provisions of Sec. 301.7216-2(d)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Otherwise compensated. A tax return preparer described in  paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section includes any person who--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is compensated for preparing a tax return for another person,  but not in the course of a business; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is compensated for helping, on a casual basis, a relative,  friend, or other acquaintance to prepare their tax return.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Exclusions. A person is not a tax return preparer merely because  he leases office space to a tax return preparer, furnishes credit to a  taxpayer whose tax return is prepared by a tax return preparer,  furnishes information to a tax return preparer at the taxpayer's  request, furnishes access (free or otherwise) to a separate person's tax  return preparation Web site through a hyperlink on his own Web site, or  otherwise performs some service that only incidentally relates to the  preparation of tax returns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The application of Sec. 301.7216-1(b)(2) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Bank B is a tax return preparer within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and an Authorized IRS e-file  Provider. B employs one individual, Q, to solicit the necessary tax  return information   for the preparation of a tax return; another individual, R, to prepare  the return on the basis of the information that is furnished; a  secretary, S, who types the information on the returns into a computer;  and an administrative assistant, T, who uses a computer to file  electronic versions of the tax returns. Under these circumstances, only  R is a tax return preparer for purposes of section 7701(a)(36), but all  four employees are tax return preparers for purposes of section 7216, as  provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Tax return preparer P contracts with department store D  to rent space in D's store. D advertises that taxpayers who use P's  services may charge the cost of having their tax return prepared to  their charge account with D. Under these circumstances, D is not a tax  return preparer because it provides space, credit, and services only  incidentally related to the preparation of tax returns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tax return information--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The term tax return  information means any information, including, but not limited to, a  taxpayer's name, address, or identifying number, which is furnished in  any form or manner for, or in connection with, the preparation of a tax  return of the taxpayer. This information includes information that the  taxpayer furnishes to a tax return preparer and information furnished to  the tax return preparer by a third party. Tax return information also  includes information the tax return preparer derives or generates from  tax return information in connection with the preparation of a  taxpayer's return.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Tax return information can be provided directly by the taxpayer  or by another person. Likewise, tax return information includes  information received by the tax return preparer from the IRS in  connection with the processing of such return, including an  acknowledgment of acceptance or notice of rejection of an electronically  filed return.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Tax return information includes statistical compilations of tax  return information, even in a form that cannot be associated with, or  otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer. See  Sec. 301.7216-2(o) for limited use of tax return information to make  statistical compilations without taxpayer consent and to use the  statistical compilations for limited purposes.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Tax return information does not include information identical to  any tax return information that has been furnished to a tax return  preparer if the identical information was obtained otherwise than in  connection with the preparation of a tax return.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Information is considered ``in connection with tax return  preparation,'' and therefore tax return information, if the taxpayer  would not have furnished the information to the tax return preparer but  for the intention to engage, or the engagement of, the tax return  preparer to prepare the tax return.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (b)(3) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Taxpayer A purchases computer software designed to assist  with the preparation and filing of her income tax return. When A loads  the software onto her computer, it prompts her to register her purchase  of the software. In this situation, the software provider is a tax  return preparer under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section and the  information that A provides to register her purchase is tax return  information because she is providing it in connection with the  preparation of a tax return.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. Corporation A is a brokerage firm that maintains a Web  site through which its clients may access their accounts, trade stocks,  and generally conduct a variety of financial activities. Through its Web  site, A offers its clients free access to its own tax preparation  software. Taxpayer B is a client of A and has furnished A his name,  address, and other information when registering for use of A's Web site  to use A's brokerage services. In addition, A has a record of B's  brokerage account activity, including sales of stock, dividends paid,  and IRA contributions made. B uses A's tax preparation software to  prepare his tax return. The software populates some fields on B's return  on the basis of information A already maintains in its databases. A is a  tax return preparer within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this  section because it has prepared and provided software for use in  preparing tax returns. The information in A's databases that the  software accesses to populate B's return, i.e., the registration  information and brokerage account activity, is not tax return  information because A did not receive that information in connection  with the preparation of a tax return. Once A uses the information to  populate the return, however, the information associated with the return  becomes tax return information. If A retains the information in a form  in which A can identify that the information was used   in connection with the preparation of a return, the information in that  form is tax return information. If, however, A retains the information  in a database in which A cannot identify whether the information was  used in connection with the preparation of a return, then that  information is not tax return information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Use of tax return information includes any  circumstance in which a tax return preparer refers to, or relies upon,  tax return information as the basis to take or permit an action.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph (b)(4) may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. Preparer G is a tax return preparer as defined by paragraph  (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. If G determines, upon preparing a return,  that the taxpayer is eligible to make a contribution to an individual  retirement account (IRA), G will ask whether the taxpayer desires to  make a contribution to an IRA. G does not ask about IRAs in cases in  which the taxpayer is not eligible to make a contribution. G is using  tax return information when it asks whether a taxpayer is interested in  making a contribution to an IRA because G is basing the inquiry upon  knowledge gained from information that the taxpayer furnished in  connection with the preparation of the taxpayer's return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disclosure. The term disclosure means the act of making tax  return information known to any person in any manner whatever. To the  extent that a taxpayer's use of a hyperlink results in the transmission  of tax return information, this transmission of tax return information  is a disclosure by the tax return preparer subject to penalty under  section 7216 if not authorized by regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Hyperlink. For purposes of section 7216, a hyperlink is a device  used to transfer an individual using tax preparation software from a tax  return preparer's Web page to a Web page operated by another person  without the individual having to separately enter the Web address of the  destination page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Request for consent. A request for consent includes any effort  by a tax return preparer to obtain the taxpayer's consent to use or  disclose the taxpayer's tax return information. The act of supplying a  taxpayer with a paper or electronic form that meets the requirements of  a revenue procedure published pursuant to Sec. 301.7216-3(a) is a  request for a consent. When a tax return preparer requests a taxpayer's  consent, any associated efforts of the tax return preparer, including,  but not limited to, verbal or written explanations of the form, are part  of the request for consent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Any applicable requirements of the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Public Law 106-102 (113 Stat. 1338), do not  supersede, alter, or affect the requirements of section 7216 and  Sec. Sec. 301.7216-1 through 301.7216-3. Similarly, the requirements of  section 7216 and Sec. Sec. 301.7216-1 through 301.7216-3 do not  override any requirements or restrictions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,  which are in addition to the requirements or restrictions of section  7216 and Sec. Sec. 301.7216-1 through 301.7216-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to  disclosures or uses of tax return information occurring on or after  January 1, 2009.  [T.D. 9375, 73 FR 1067, Jan. 7, 2008]</p>
