                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Common provisions--(1) Reporting of data. The designated contract market shall comply with part 16 of this chapter requiring the daily reporting of market data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reporting of data. The designated contract market shall comply with part 16 of this chapter requiring the daily reporting of market data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory trading halts. The rules of a designated contract market that lists or trades one or more security futures products must include the following provisions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Trading of a security futures product based on a single security shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for the underlying security; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Trading of a security futures product based on a narrow-based security index shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for one or more underlying securities that constitute 50 percent or more of the market capitalization of the narrow-based security index.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Speculative position limits. The designated contract market shall have rules in place establishing position limits or position accountability procedures for the expiring futures contract month. The designated contract market shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adopt a net position limit no greater than 13,500 (100-share) contracts applicable to positions held during the last five trading days of an expiring contract month; except where,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For security futures products where the average daily trading volume in the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares, or exceeds 15 million shares and there are more than 40 million shares of the underlying security outstanding, the designated contract market may adopt a net position limit no greater than 22,500 (100-share) contracts applicable to positions held during the last five trading days of an expiring contract month; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For security futures products where the average daily trading volume in the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares and there are more than 40 million shares of the underlying security outstanding, the designated contract market may adopt a position accountability rule. Upon request by the designated contract market, traders who hold net positions greater than 22,500 (100-share) contracts, or such lower level specified by exchange rules, must provide information to the exchange and consent to halt increasing their positions when so ordered by the exchange.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a security futures product comprised of more than one security, the criteria in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section must apply to the security in the index with the lowest average daily trading volume.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Exchanges may approve exemptions from these position limits pursuant to rules that are consistent with Sec. 150.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of this section, average daily trading volume shall be calculated monthly, using data for the most recent six-month period. If the data justify a higher or lower speculative limit for a security future, the designated contract market may raise or lower the position limit for that security future effective no earlier than the day after it has provided notification to the Commission and to the public under the submission requirements of Sec. 41.24. If the data require imposition of a reduced position limit for a security future, the designated contract market may permit any trader holding a position in compliance with the previous position limit, but in excess of the reduced limit, to maintain such position through the expiration of the security futures contract; provided, that the designated contract market does not find that the position poses a threat to the orderly expiration of such contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final settlement prices for security futures products. (1) The final settlement price of a cash-settled security futures product must fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The final settlement price of a cash-settled security futures product must fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if an opening price for one or more securities underlying a security futures product is not readily available, the final settlement price of the security futures product shall fairly reflect:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The price of the underlying security or securities during the most recent regular trading session for such security or securities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The next available opening price of the underlying security or securities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, if a derivatives clearing organization registered under Section 5b of the Act or a clearing agency exempt from registration pursuant to Section 5b(a)(2) of the Act, to which the final settlement price of a security futures product is or would be reported determines, pursuant to its rules, that such final settlement price is not consistent with the protection of customers and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to buyers and sellers of the affected security futures product, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security futures product, and consistency of interpretation and practice, the clearing organization shall have the authority to determine, under its rules, a final settlement price for such security futures product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special requirements for physical delivery contracts. For security futures products settled by actual delivery of the underlying security or securities, payment and delivery of the underlying security or securities must be effected through a clearing agency that is registered pursuant to section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission may exempt a designated contract market from the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not operate as an exemption from any Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
