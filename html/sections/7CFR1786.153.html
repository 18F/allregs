For the purpose of the terms A, B, E,  and F above the published Treasury rate and term shall mean the Treasury  Constant Maturities from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release for 7  years, 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the event that the borrower prepays a loan under paragraph  (a) of this section using, directly or indirectly, tax exempt financing,  the discount shall be adjusted to ensure that the borrower receives a  benefit that is no greater than the benefit the borrower would receive  if the borrower used financing that was not tax exempt. The borrower  shall certify in writing whether the financing will be tax exempt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The discount rate established in paragraph (a) of this section  shall be adjusted for a tax exempt financing by substituting for the  ``I'' term in the discount rate formula, a discount rate equal to the  interest rate(s) published pursuant to 7 CFR 1714.5, determination of  interest rates on municipal rate loans. This is the interest rate  established for the new RUS loan program which is based on municipal  interest rates for issues of comparable maturity. No interpolation or  average will be used. If a note is to be prepaid under this subpart and  is subject to this tax exempt adjustment, the discount rate will be  determined from the published table in the Federal Register.For example,  if the note to be discounted matures in the year 1999 then the discount  rate will be the interest rate for the year 1999. RUS will publish a  schedule of interest rates for municipal rate loans in the Federal  Register at the beginning of each calendar quarter.   The published rates in effect eight business days prior to closing will  be used for the discount rates. All notes to be prepaid that have  remaining years to maturity of more than 20 years will be discounted at  the interest rate in effect for new RUS municipal rate loans of  comparable maturity at the time of closing.</p>
