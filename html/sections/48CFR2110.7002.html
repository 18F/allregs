                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor is required to invest and reinvest all FEGLI Program funds on hand, including any attributable to the special contingency reserve (as used in 5 U.S.C. 8712), until needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Within the constraints of safety and liquidity of investments, the Contractor must seek to maximize investment income. However, the Contractor will not be responsible for any actions taken at the direction of OPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor is required to credit income earned from its investment of FEGLI Program funds to the FEGLI Program. Thus, the Contractor

must be able to allocate investment income to the FEGLI Program in an appropriate manner. If the Contractor fails to invest funds on hand, properly allocate investment income, or credit any income due to the contract, for whatever reason, it must return or credit any investment income lost to OPM or the FEGLI Program, retroactive to the date that such funds should have been originally invested, allocated, or credited in accordance with the clause at 2152.210-70 of this chapter.
