The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade and a charged or affected party may settle a charge brought under this part by mutual agreement at any time after service of the charging letter; approval of the presiding official or the administrative protective order Sanctions Board is not necessary. The charged or affected party may request a hearing but at the same time request that a presiding official not be appointed pending settlement discussions. Settlement agreements may include sanctions for purposes of Sec. 354.18. The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If there has been no request for a hearing, or if supporting information has not been submitted under Sec. 354.13, the withdrawal will not preclude future actions on the same alleged violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a hearing has been requested but no presiding official has been appointed, withdrawal of the charging letter will preclude the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade from seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade may amend, supplement or withdraw the charging letter at any time after the appointment of a presiding official, if the presiding official determines that the interests of justice would thereby be served.

If applicable laws or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of service set forth in paragraph (c) of this section inappropriate or ineffective, service of the charging letter on a person who is not a resident of the United States may be made by any method that is permitted by the country in which the person resides and that satisfies the due process requirements under United States law with respect to notice in administrative proceedings.
