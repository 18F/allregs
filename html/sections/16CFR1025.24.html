                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Rulings of the Presiding Officer may not be appealed to  the Commission prior to the Initial Decision, except as provided in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interlocutory appeals to Commission. The  Commission   may, in its discretion, consider interlocutory appeals where a ruling of  the Presiding Officer:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requires the production of records claimed to be confidential;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requires the testimony of a supervisory official of the  Commission other than one especially knowledgeable of the facts of the  matter in adjudication;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Excludes an attorney from participation in any proceedings  pursuant to Sec. 1025.42(b);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Denies or unduly limits a petition for intervention pursuant to  the provisions of Sec. 1025.17.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedure for interlocutory appeals. Within ten (10) days of  issuance of a ruling other than one ordering the production of records  claimed to be confidential, any party may petition the Commission to  consider an interlocutory appeal of a ruling in the categories  enumerated above. The petition shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. Any  other party may file a response to the petition within ten (10) days of  its service except where the order appealed from requires the production  of records claimed to be confidential. The response shall not exceed  fifteen (15) pages. The Commission shall decide the petition or may  request such further briefing or oral presentation as it deems  necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Presiding Officer orders the production of records  claimed to be confidential a petition for interlocutory appeal shall be  filed within five (5) days of the entry of the order. Any opposition to  the petition shall be filed within five (5) days of service of the  petition. The order of the Presiding Officer shall be automatically  stayed until five (5) days following the date of entry of the order to  allow an affected party the opportunity to file a petition with the  Commission for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Sec. 1025.24(b)(2).  If an affected party files a petition with the Commission pursuant to  Sec. 1025.24(b)(2) within the 5-day period, the stay of the Presiding  Officer's order is automatically extended until the Commission decides  the petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interlocutory appeals from all other rulings--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Grounds.  Interlocutory appeals from all other rulings by the Presiding Officer  may proceed only upon motion to the Presiding Officer and a  determination by the Presiding Officer in writing that the ruling  involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which there is  substantial ground for differences of opinion and that an immediate  appeal from the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination  of the litigation, or that subsequent review will be an inadequate  remedy. The Presiding Officer's certification shall state the reasons  for the determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Form. If the Presiding Officer makes the determination  described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, a petition for  interlocutory appeal under this subparagraph may be filed in accordance  with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proceedings not stayed. Except as otherwise provided under this  section, a petition for interlocutory appeal shall not stay the  proceedings before the Presiding Officer unless the Presiding Officer or  the Commission so orders.</p>
