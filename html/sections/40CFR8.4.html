                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic information requirements. In addition to the information required pursuant to other sections of this part, all environmental documents shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, mailing address, and phone number of the operator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The anticipated date(s) of departure of each expedition to Antarctica;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An estimate of the number of persons in each expedition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The means of conveyance of expedition(s) to and within Antarctica;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Estimated length of stay of each expedition in Antarctica;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Information on proposed landing sites in Antarctica; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Information concerning training of staff, supervision of expedition members, and what other measures, if any,

that will be taken to avoid or minimize possible environmental impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation of an environmental document. Unless an operator determines and documents that a proposed activity will have less than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment, the operator will prepare an IEE or CEE in accordance with this part. In making the determination what level of environmental documentation is appropriate, the operator should consider, as applicable, whether and to what degree the proposed activity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the potential to adversely affect the Antarctic environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May adversely affect climate or weather patterns;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> May adversely affect air or water quality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> May affect atmospheric, terrestrial (including aquatic), glacial, or marine environments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> May detrimentally affect the distribution, abundance, or productivity of species, or populations of species of fauna and flora;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> May further jeopardize endangered or threatened species or populations of such species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> May degrade, or pose substantial risk to, areas of biological, scientific, historic, aesthetic, or wilderness significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Has highly uncertain environmental effects, or involves unique or unknown environmental risks; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Together with other activities, the effects of any one of which is individually insignificant, may have at least minor or transitory cumulative environmental effects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Type of environmental document. The type of environmental document required under this part depends upon the nature and intensity of the environmental impacts that could result from the activity under consideration. A PERM must be prepared by the operator to document the conclusion of the operator's preliminary environmental review that the impact of a proposed activity on the Antarctic environment will be less than minor or transitory. (See Sec. 8.6.) An IEE must be prepared by the operator for proposed activities which may have at least (but no more than) a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment. (See Sec. 8.7.) A CEE must be prepared by the operator if an IEE indicates, or if it is otherwise determined, that a proposed activity is likely to have more than a minor or transitory impact on the Antarctic environment (See Sec. 8.8.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Incorporation of information, consolidation of environmental documentation, and multi-year environmental documentation. (1) An operator may incorporate material into an environmental document by referring to it in the document when the effect will be to reduce paperwork without impeding the review of the environmental document by EPA and other federal agencies. The incorporated material shall be cited and its content briefly described. No material may be incorporated by referring to it in the document unless it is reasonably available to the EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An operator may incorporate material into an environmental document by referring to it in the document when the effect will be to reduce paperwork without impeding the review of the environmental document by EPA and other federal agencies. The incorporated material shall be cited and its content briefly described. No material may be incorporated by referring to it in the document unless it is reasonably available to the EPA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provided that environmental documentation complies with all applicable provisions of Annex I to the Protocol and this part and is appropriate in light of the specific circumstances of the operator's proposed expedition or expeditions, an operator may include more than one proposed expedition within one environmental document and one environmental document may also be used to address expeditions being carried out by more than one operator provided that the environmental document indicates the names of each operator for which the environmental documentation is being submitted pursuant to obligations under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Multi-year environmental documentation. (1) Provided that environmental documentation complies with all applicable provisions of Annex I to the Protocol and this part, an operator may submit environmental documentation for proposed expeditions for a period of up to five consecutive austral summer seasons, provided that the conditions described in the multi-year environmental document, including the assessment of cumulative impacts, are unchanged and meets the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provided that environmental documentation complies with all applicable provisions of Annex I to the Protocol and this part, an operator may submit environmental documentation for proposed expeditions for a period of up to five consecutive austral summer seasons, provided that the conditions described in the multi-year environmental document, including the assessment of cumulative impacts, are unchanged and meets the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The operator shall identify the environmental documentation submitted for multi-year documentation purposes in the first year it is submitted. If the operator, or operators, fail to make

this initial identification to EPA, this provision shall not be in effect although subsequent years' submissions by the operator, or operators, may use this environmental documentation as provided in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In subsequent years, up to a total maximum of five years, the operator, or operators, shall reference the multi-year documentation identified initially if it is necessary to update the basic information requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An operator, or operators, may supplement a multi-year environmental document for an additional activity or activities by providing information regarding the proposed activity in accordance with the appropriate provisions of this part. The operator, or operators, shall identify this submission as a proposed supplement to the multi-year documentation in effect. Addition of the supplemental information shall not extend the period of the multi-year environmental documentation beyond the time period associated with the documentation as originally submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multi-year environmental documentation may include more than one proposed expedition within the environmental document and the multi-year environmental document may also be used to address expeditions being carried out by more than one operator provided that the environmental document indicates the names of each operator for which the environmental documentation is being submitted pursuant to obligations under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The schedules for multi-year environmental documentation depend on the level of the environmental document and shall be the same as the schedules for comparable environmental documentation submitted on an annual basis; e.g., a multi-year PERM shall comply with the schedule in Sec. 8.6, a multi-year IEE shall comply with the schedule in Sec. 8.7, and a multi-year CEE shall comply with the schedule in Sec. 8.8. These schedules apply to the operator's submission of the initial multi-year environmental document; the operator's subsequent annual submissions pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section; EPA's review, in consultation with other interested federal agencies, and comment on the multi-year environmental documentation and subsequent annual submissions; and a finding the EPA may make, with the concurrence of the National Science Foundation, that the environmental documentation submitted does not meet the requirements of Article 8 and Annex I of the Protocol and the provisions of this part.</p>
