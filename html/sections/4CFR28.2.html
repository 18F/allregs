                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board has jurisdiction to hear and decide the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proceedings in which the General Counsel seeks to stay a  personnel action based upon an alleged prohibited personnel practice  that has occurred or is about to occur;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proceedings in which the General Counsel seeks corrective action  for an alleged prohibited personnel practice; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proceedings in which the General Counsel seeks discipline for a  GAO employee who has allegedly committed a   prohibited personnel practice or who has engaged in prohibited political  activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board has jurisdiction to hear any action brought by any  person or group of persons in the following subject areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An officer or employee petition involving a removal, suspension  for more than 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough of not  more than 30 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appropriateness of a unit of employees for collective  bargaining;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An election or certification of a collective bargaining  representative;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A matter appealable to the Board under the labor-management  relations program under 31 U.S.C. 732(e), including an unfair labor  practice under 31 U.S.C. 732(e)(1);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An action involving discrimination prohibited under 31 U.S.C.  732(f)(1); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An issue about GAO personnel which the Comptroller General by  regulation decides the Board shall resolve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special jurisdictional rules where matters are covered by a  negotiated grievance procedure. If a GAO employee is covered by a  collective bargaining agreement containing a negotiated grievance  procedure that permits the employee to grieve matters that would  otherwise be appealable to the Board, the following special rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Matters involving discrimination, performance-based reduction in  grade or removal, or adverse action. If the negotiated grievance  procedure permits the employee to grieve matters involving prohibited  discrimination (as defined in Sec. 28.95), performance-based reduction  in grade or removal (as described in 5 U.S.C. 4303) or an adverse action  (as described in 5 U.S.C. 7512), then the employee may elect to raise  the matter either under the negotiated grievance procedure or under the  Board's procedures, but not both. The employee will be deemed to have  elected the Board's procedures if the employee files a timely charge  with the Board's General Counsel or files a timely written EEO complaint  with GAO before filing a timely written grievance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Matters involving prohibited personnel practices. If the  negotiated grievance procedure permits the employee to grieve an  appealable action involving a prohibited personnel practice other than  prohibited discrimination (as defined in Sec. 28.95), such an action  may be raised under either, but not both, of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> The Board's procedures; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> The negotiated grievance procedure.</p><p class="depth4">The employee will be deemed to have elected the Board's procedures  if the employee files a timely charge with the Board's Office of General  Counsel before filing a timely grievance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other matters. If the negotiated grievance procedure permits the  employee to grieve any matters which would otherwise be appealable to  the Board, other than those listed in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of  this section, then those matters may only be raised under the negotiated  grievance procedure and not before the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Board review of final decisions from the negotiated grievance  procedure involving discrimination. If an employee elects to pursue a  matter involving prohibited discrimination (as defined in Sec. 28.95)  through the negotiated grievance procedure, the employee may ask the  Board to review the final decision of the negotiated grievance procedure  as it relates to the issue of discrimination. A petition seeking such  review shall be filed with the Clerk of the Board within 20 days of  receipt of the final decision of the negotiated grievance procedure. The  Board will not review any final decisions of the negotiated grievance  procedure other than those where prohibited discrimination was raised as  an issue in the grievance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except for actions involving prohibited discrimination (under  Sec. 28.95) or any other prohibited personnel practice, any appealable  action that is excluded from the application of the negotiated grievance  procedure may be raised only under the Board's procedures.
