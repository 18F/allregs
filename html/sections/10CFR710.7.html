                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The decision as to access authorization is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after consideration of all relevant information, favorable and unfavorable, as to whether the granting or continuation of access authorization will not endanger the common defense and security and is clearly consistent with the national interest. Any doubt as to an individual's access authorization eligibility shall be resolved in favor of the national security. Absent any derogatory information, a favorable determination usually will be made as to access authorization eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To assist in making these determinations, on the basis of all the information in a particular case, there are set forth in this subpart criteria consisting of a number of specific types of derogatory information. These criteria are not exhaustive but contain the principal types of derogatory information which create a question as to the individual's eligibility for access authorization. DOE is not limited to these criteria or precluded from exercising its judgment that information or facts in a case under its cognizance are derogatory although at variance with, or outside the scope of, the stated categories. These criteria are subject to continuing review and may be revised from time to time as experience and circumstances may make desirable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In resolving a question concerning an individual's eligibility for access authorization, all DOE officials involved in the decision-making process shall consider: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the age and maturity of the individual at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the absence or presence of rehabilitation or reformation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; the likelihood of continuation or recurrence; and other relevant and material factors.
