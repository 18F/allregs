                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Procedure for determination. The Secretaries shall determine the territorial shares concurrently with their determination of the total annual duty exemption, and in the same manner (see Sec. 303.3, above).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Standards for determination--(1) Limitations. A territorial share may not be reduced by more than 500,000 units in any calendar year. No territorial share shall be less than 500,000 units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Criteria for setting precise quantities. The Secretaries shall determine the precise quantities after considering, inter alia, the territorial capacity to produce and ship watch units. The Secretaries shall further bear in mind the aggregate benefits to the territories, such as creditable wages paid, creditable wages per unit exported, and corporate income tax payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitations on reduction of share. The Secretaries shall not reduce a territory's share if its producers use 85%

or more of the quantity distributed to that territory in the immediately preceding year, except in the case of a major increase or decrease in the number of producers in a territory or if they believe that a territorial industry will decrease production by more than 15% from the total of the preceding year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Standby redistribution authority. The Secretaries may redistribute territorial shares if such action is warranted by circumstances unforeseen at the time of the initial distributions, such as that a territory will use less than 80% of its total by the end of a calendar year, or if a redistribution is necessary to maintain the competitive nature of the territorial industries.
