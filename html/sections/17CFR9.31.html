                                Sec. 9.31  Commission review of disciplinary or access denial action
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for additional information. Where a person disciplined  or denied access has not appealed the exchange decision to the  Commission, upon review of the notice specified in Sec. 9.11, the   Division of Market Oversight or the Division of Swap Dealer and  Intermediary Oversight and Division of Clearing and Risk may request  that the exchange file with the Division the record of the exchange  proceeding, or designated portions of the record, a brief statement of  the evidence and testimony adduced to support the exchange's findings  that a rule or rules of the exchange were violated and such recordings,  transcripts and other documents applicable to the particular exchange  proceeding as the Division may specify. The exchange must promptly  advise the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access  denial action of the Division's request. Within thirty days after  service of the Division's request, the exchange must file the  information requested with the Division and, upon request, deliver that  information to the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or  access denial action. Delivery and filing must be in the manner  prescribed by Sec. 9.11(c). A person subject to the disciplinary action  or access denial action requesting a copy of the information furnished  to the Division must, if the exchange rules so provide, agree to pay the  exchange reasonable fees for printing the copy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review on motion of the Commission. The Commission may institute  review of an exchange disciplinary or access denial action on its own  motion. Other than in extraordinary circumstances, such review will be  initiated within 180 days after the Commission has received the notice  of exchange action provided for in Sec. 9.11. If the Commission should  institute review on its own motion, it will issue an order permitting  the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial  action an opportunity to file an appropriate submission, and the  exchange an opportunity to file a reply thereto.
