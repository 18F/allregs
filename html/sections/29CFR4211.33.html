Under this section, the amount of unfunded vested  benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a merged plan  after the initial plan year is the sum of the employer's proportional  share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's initial plan year  unfunded vested benefits (determined under paragraph (b) of this  section) and the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount  of the unfunded vested benefits arising after the initial plan year  (determined under paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>, with such sum reduced as if it were being fully  amortized in level annual installments over fifteen years beginning with  the first plan year after the initial plan year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> of  this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount of unfunded vested benefits.

An employer's proportional share  of the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is  computed by multiplying that amount by a fraction--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of which is the total amount required to be  contributed under the plan (or under the employer's prior plan) by the  employer for the last five full plan years ending before the date on  which the employer withdraws; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator of which is the total amount contributed under  the plan (or under each employer's prior plan) by all employers for the  last five full plan years ending before the date on which the employer  withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed  with respect to earlier periods that were collected in those plan years,  and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer that withdrew  from the plan (or prior plan) during those plan years.</p>
