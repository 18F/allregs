                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Preliminary Note to Sec. 210.2-01</p><p class="depth0">1. Section 210.2-01 is designed to ensure that auditors are qualified and independent of their audit clients both in fact and in appearance. Accordingly, the rule sets forth restrictions on financial, employment, and business relationships between an accountant and an audit client and restrictions on an accountant providing certain non-audit services to an audit client.</p><p class="depth0">2. Section 210.2-01(b) sets forth the general standard of auditor independence. Paragraphs (c)(1) to (c)(5) reflect the application of the general standard to particular circumstances. The rule does not purport to, and the Commission could not, consider all circumstances that raise independence concerns, and these are subject to the general standard in Sec. 210.2-01(b). In considering this standard, the Commission looks in the first instance to whether a relationship or the provision of a service: creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the accountant and the audit client; places the accountant in the position of auditing his or her own work; results in the accountant acting as management or an employee of the audit client; or places the accountant in a position of being an advocate for the audit client.</p><p class="depth0">3. These factors are general guidance only and their application may depend on particular facts and circumstances. For that reason, Sec. 210.2-01 provides that, in determining whether an accountant is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. For the same reason, registrants and accountants are encouraged to consult with the Commission's Office of the Chief Accountant before entering into relationships, including relationships involving the provision of services, that are not explicitly described in the rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office. The Commission will not recognize any person as a public accountant who is not in good standing and entitled to practice as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Commission will not recognize an accountant as independent, with respect to an audit client, if the accountant is not, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that the accountant is not, capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the accountant's engagement. In determining whether an accountant is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant circumstances, including all relationships between the accountant and the audit client, and not just those relating to reports filed with the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> This paragraph sets forth a non-exclusive specification of circumstances inconsistent with paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Financial relationships. An accountant is not independent if, at any point during the audit and professional engagement period, the accountant has a direct financial interest or a material indirect financial interest in the accountant's audit client, such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Investments in audit clients. An accountant is not independent when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or any of his or her immediate family members, has any direct investment in an audit client, such as stocks, bonds, notes, options, or other securities. The term direct investment includes an investment in an audit client through an intermediary if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The accounting firm, covered person, or immediate family member, alone or together with other persons, supervises or participates in the intermediary's investment decisions or has control over the intermediary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The intermediary is not a diversified management investment company, as defined by section 5(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1), and has an investment in the audit client that amounts to 20% or more of the value of the intermediary's total investments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any partner, principal, shareholder, or professional employee of the accounting firm, any of his or her immediate family members, any close family member of a covered person in

the firm, or any group of the above persons has filed a Schedule 13D or 13G (17 CFR 240.13d-101 or 240.13d-102) with the Commission indicating beneficial ownership of more than five percent of an audit client's equity securities or controls an audit client, or a close family member of a partner, principal, or shareholder of the accounting firm controls an audit client.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or any of his or her immediate family members, serves as voting trustee of a trust, or executor of an estate, containing the securities of an audit client, unless the accounting firm, covered person in the firm, or immediate family member has no authority to make investment decisions for the trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, any of his or her immediate family members, or any group of the above persons has any material indirect investment in an audit client. For purposes of this paragraph, the term material indirect investment does not include ownership by any covered person in the firm, any of his or her immediate family members, or any group of the above persons of 5% or less of the outstanding shares of a diversified management investment company, as defined by section 5(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1), that invests in an audit client.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The accounting firm, any covered person in the firm, or any of his or her immediate family members:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Has any direct or material indirect investment in an entity where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An audit client has an investment in that entity that is material to the audit client and has the ability to exercise significant influence over that entity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The entity has an investment in an audit client that is material to that entity and has the ability to exercise significant influence over that audit client;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Has any material investment in an entity over which an audit client has the ability to exercise significant influence; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Has the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity that has the ability to exercise significant influence over an audit client.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other financial interests in audit client.

Any savings, checking, or similar account at a bank, savings and loan, or similar institution that is an audit client, if the account has a balance that exceeds the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any similar insurer, except that an accounting firm account may have an uninsured balance provided that the likelihood of the bank, savings and loan, or similar institution experiencing financial difficulties is remote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Broker-dealer accounts. Brokerage or similar accounts maintained with a broker-dealer that is an audit client, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any such account includes any asset other than cash or securities (within the meaning of ``security'' provided in the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (``SIPA'') (15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of assets in the accounts exceeds the amount that is subject to a Securities Investor Protection Corporation advance, for those accounts, under Section 9 of SIPA (15 U.S.C. 78fff-3); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With respect to non-U.S. accounts not subject to SIPA protection, the value of assets in the accounts exceeds the amount insured or protected by a program similar to SIPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Futures commission merchant accounts. Any futures, commodity, or similar account maintained with a futures commission merchant that is an audit client.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Credit cards. Any aggregate outstanding credit card balance owed to a lender that is an audit client that is not reduced to $10,000 or less on a current basis taking into consideration the payment due date and any available grace period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Insurance products. Any individual policy issued by an insurer that is an audit client unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The policy was obtained at a time when the covered person in the firm was not a covered person in the firm; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood of the insurer becoming insolvent is remote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Investment companies. Any financial interest in an entity that is part of an investment company complex that includes an audit client.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, an accountant will not be deemed not independent if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Inheritance and gift. Any person acquires an unsolicited financial interest, such as through an unsolicited gift or inheritance, that would cause an accountant to be not independent under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and the financial interest is disposed of as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after the person has knowledge of and the right to dispose of the financial interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> New audit engagement.
