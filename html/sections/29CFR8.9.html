The Board may affirm, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, the decision under review and shall issue a decision including a statement of reasons or bases for the actions taken. The Board shall modify or set aside findings of fact only when it determines that those findings are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In any remand of a case as provided in Sec. 8.1(e) of this title, the Board shall include any appropriate instructions.</p>
