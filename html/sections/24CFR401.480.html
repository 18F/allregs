                                Sec. 401.480  Sale or transfer of project.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> May the owner request a Restructuring Plan that includes a sale or transfer of the property? The owner may request a Restructuring Plan that includes a condition that the property be sold or transferred to a purchaser acceptable to HUD in a reasonable period needed to consummate the transaction. The failure to consummate a sale or transfer of the property requested under paragraph (a) of this section will

neither adversely affect an owner's eligibility for a Restructuring Plan nor exempt the owner from the requirements of Sec. 401.600. There are no priority purchaser requirements for a voluntary sale or transfer by an owner that is eligible for a Restructuring Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When must the restructuring plan include sale or transfer of the property? If the owner is determined to be ineligible pursuant to Sec. 401.101 or Sec. 401.403, or if the property is subject to an approved plan of action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990, as described in section 524(e)(3) of MAHRA, the property must be sold or transferred as a condition of implementation of a restructuring plan, which must include a condition that the owner sell or transfer the property to a purchaser acceptable to HUD, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Such sale or transfer shall be a condition to the implementation of the Restructuring Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Owner's notice of intent to sell or transfer. (1) The owner must provide notice to the PAE affirming the owner's intent to sell or transfer the property. This notice must be received by the PAE no later than 30 days after a notice of rejection under Sec. 401.101 or Sec. 401.403 has become a final determination under subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner must cooperate in selling or transferring the property. Failure to do so will result in the PAE's determination to reject the owner's request for a Restructuring Plan. The owner must distribute and publish, in an appropriate publication, a notice to potential purchasers that describes the property, proposed terms of sale, and procedures for submitting a purchase offer. The notice in form and substance must be acceptable to HUD, and must inform potential offerors of a preference for priority purchasers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During a period to be determined by HUD that begins when the owner gives notice of intent to sell or transfer, an owner may accept an offer only from a priority purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No sale or transfer to a non-priority purchaser will be approved without evidence of tenant support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Informing PAE; approval required. The owner must inform the PAE of any offer to purchase the property and the owner must advise the PAE of the substance and on-going status of the owner's discussions with any prospective purchaser. The owner's acceptance of the offer must be subject to PAE approval, and HUD approval of the Restructuring Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tenant endorsement procedure for priority purchaser status. (1) Required meeting. (i) A community-based nonprofit or public agency purchaser requesting tenant endorsement to obtain priority purchaser status must conduct an informational meeting with the tenants of the project to disseminate information about both the endorsement request and the purchaser's plans for the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the purchaser is acting contemporaneously with the Restructuring Plan, the informational meeting must occur at the second meeting of tenants convened by the PAE to discuss the restructuring plan pursuant to Sec. 401.500(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A representative of the purchasing entity must attend the informational meeting to present its plans for the acquisition and improvement of the project and to respond to questions about the purchaser's plans for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tenants shall have the opportunity, but are not to be required, to vote for or against the acquisition at the informational meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For the purpose of obtaining tenant endorsement, a purchaser may conduct additional meetings with tenants in accordance with the notice requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parties who must receive notice. The purchaser must deliver notice of the informational meeting, and any subsequent meeting, to each tenant household in the project and any tenant organization for the project, and post notices of the meeting in the project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notice contents. The notice must identify the place, date, and time of the informational meeting, and any subsequent meeting. Include a brief description of the purpose of the meeting and provide a narrative outlining the

purchaser's plans for the project, including any request made to HUD for debt relief under Sec. 401.461(b)(5) of the second and any additional mortgage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tenant endorsement. (i) A purchaser may demonstrate that it is tenant endorsed by submitting documentation to HUD that a majority (51 percent) of the tenant heads of household have given their endorsement in writing. Such documentation may include, but is not limited to, ballots, letters of support, or petitions. The endorsement of tenants who did not attend, or vote at, the informational meeting, or any subsequent meeting, may be sought directly from each of these tenants subsequent to the meeting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> If the purchaser has made a reasonable effort to obtain the endorsement of a majority (51 percent) of the tenants and the necessary percentage of votes was not obtained, the purchaser may seek HUD approval to obtain endorsement based on a lower percentage of endorsing tenants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the purchaser has made a reasonable effort to obtain the endorsement of a majority (51 percent) of the tenants and the necessary percentage of votes was not obtained, the purchaser may seek HUD approval to obtain endorsement based on a lower percentage of endorsing tenants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The purchaser must deliver notice to each tenant household that the purchaser is seeking HUD approval of a tenant endorsement based on less than 51 percent of tenant approval and provide tenants with at least 10 days from the date of the notice to submit comments to the purchaser on the approval of endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The purchaser and/or seller must submit, in writing, to HUD an account of the efforts taken to secure tenant endorsement, the number and percentage of tenants voting for and against endorsement, and any comments received from tenants regarding the approval of endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> HUD will determine whether or not to approve endorsement on the basis of all the information available to HUD and will promptly notify the purchaser of HUD's determination.
