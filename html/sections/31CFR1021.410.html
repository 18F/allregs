Where the  deposit, account or credit is in the names of two or more persons, the  casino shall secure the name, permanent address, and social security  number of each person having a financial interest in the deposit,  account or line of credit.

The verification shall be made by examination of a  document of the type described in Sec. 1010.312 of this chapter, and  the specific identifying information shall be recorded in the manner  described in Sec. 1010.312 of this chapter. In the event that a casino  has been unable to secure the required social security number, it shall  not be deemed to be in violation of this section if it has made a  reasonable effort to secure such number and it maintains a list  containing the names and permanent addresses of those persons from who  it has been unable to obtain social security numbers and makes the names  and addresses of those persons available to the Secretary upon request.  Where a person is a nonresident alien, the casino shall also record the  person's passport number or a description of some other government  document used to verify his identity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, each casino shall retain either the original or a  microfilm or other copy or reproduction of each of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A record of each receipt (including but not limited to funds for  safekeeping or front money) of funds by the casino for the account  (credit or deposit) of any person.
