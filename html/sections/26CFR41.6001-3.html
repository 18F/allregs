                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) must be presented to United States Customs officials with respect to any highway motor vehicle subject to the tax imposed by section 4481(a) that has a base for registration purposes in a contiguous foreign country upon entry of such vehicle into the United States during any taxable period to which this section applies. Such proof of payment must relate to tax paid (or suspended under Sec. 41.4483-3) for the taxable period that includes the date of entry into the United States. See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of the term ``proof of payment.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a) must be presented to United States Customs officials with respect to any highway motor vehicle subject to the tax imposed by section 4481(a) that has a base for registration purposes in a contiguous foreign country upon entry of such vehicle into the United States during any taxable period to which this section applies. Such proof of payment must relate to tax paid (or suspended under Sec. 41.4483-3) for the taxable period that includes the date of entry into the United States. See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of the term ``proof of payment.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No proof of payment is required upon entry of a highway motor vehicle described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section into the United States if, as of the date of such entry, the period of time for filing a return of the tax imposed on such vehicle by section 4481(a) for the taxable period that includes the date of such entry has not expired and a written declaration is presented to United States Customs officials. Such declaration must state that, as of the date of such entry, the period of time for filing a return of the tax imposed on such vehicle by section 4481(a) for the taxable period that includes the date of such entry has not expired. The written declaration must include (i) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person liable under Sec. 41.4481-2 for the tax imposed on such vehicle; (ii) the vehicle identification number of such vehicle; (iii) the date on which such vehicle was first used on the public highways in the United States during the taxable period (or a statement that the current entry is the first use on the public highways in the United States during the taxable period); (iv) an acknowledgment by the person liable for the tax imposed on such vehicle that the willful use of the declaration to evade or defeat the tax otherwise applicable under section 4481(a) will subject such person to a fine or imprisonment or both; and (v) the signature of the person liable for the tax imposed on such vehicle. A copy of the written declaration shall be retained in the records of the person liable for the tax imposed on such vehicle under the rules of Sec. 41.6001-1. See Sec. 41.6071(a)-1 for rules regarding the time for filing a return of the tax imposed by section 4481(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Failure to provide proof of payment. If, upon attempting to enter the United States, the operator of a highway motor vehicle described in paragraph (a) of this section is unable to present proof of payment of the tax imposed by section 4481(a), or documentation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, with respect to such vehicle, then such vehicle may be denied entry into the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proof of payment--(1) In general. For purposes of this section, the proof of payment required in paragraph (a) of this section shall consist of a receipted Schedule 1 (Form 2290) that is returned by the Internal Revenue Service to a taxpayer that files a return of tax under section 4481(a) and pays the amount of tax (or installment thereof) due with such return. A photocopy of such receipted Schedule 1 shall also serve as proof of payment. Such proof of payment shall also serve as proof or suspension of the tax under Sec. 41.4483-3 for the number of vehicles entered in that part of the Schedule 1 designated for vehicles for which tax has been suspended. The vehicle identification number of any vehicle for which a return is being filed, whether tax is being paid with respect to such vehicle or tax is suspended on such vehicle, must appear on the Schedule 1 (or an attached page) in order for the Schedule 1 to be a valid proof of payment for such vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, the proof of payment required in paragraph (a) of this section shall consist of a receipted Schedule 1 (Form 2290) that is returned by the Internal Revenue Service to a taxpayer that files a return of tax under section 4481(a) and pays the amount of tax (or installment thereof) due with such return. A photocopy of such receipted Schedule 1 shall also serve as proof of payment. Such proof of payment shall also serve as proof or suspension of the tax under Sec. 41.4483-3 for the number of vehicles entered in that part of the Schedule 1 designated for vehicles for which tax has been suspended. The vehicle identification number of any vehicle for which a return is being filed, whether tax is being paid with respect to such vehicle or tax is suspended on such vehicle, must appear on the Schedule 1 (or an attached page) in order for the Schedule 1 to be a valid proof of payment for such vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acceptable substitute for receipted Schedule 1. For purposes of this section, a photocopy of the Form 2290 (with the Schedule 1 attached) that is filed with the Internal Revenue Service for a vehicle being entered into the United States with sufficient documentation of payment of tax due at the time the Form 2290 is filed (such as a photocopy of both sides of a cancelled check) shall be accepted as proof of payment. No documentation of payment of tax is required with the substitute proof of payment if at the time the Form 2290 is filed the tax imposed by section 4481(a) is suspended under Sec. 41.4483-3 with respect to the vehicle entering the United States. This substitute proof of payment may be used to enter a vehicle into the United States when, for example, the receipted Schedule 1 has been lost, or if the taxpayer that filed a Form 2290 with respect to such vehicle has not received a receipted Schedule 1 at the time such vehicle enters the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Taxable periods to which this section applies. This section shall apply to any taxable period beginning on or after July 1, 1987.

The return required under paragraph (a) of this section is Form 2290, ``Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return,'' or such other return as the Commissioner may prescribe. The return is made in accordance with the instructions applicable to the form.
[T.D. 8879, 65 FR 17154, Mar. 31, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date Note: By T.D. 9698, 79 FR 64317, Oct. 29, 2014, Sec. 41.6011(a)-1 was amended by adding paragraphs (a)(4), (c) and (d), effective July 1, 2015. For the convenience of the user the added text is set forth as follows:


Sec. 41.6011(a)-1  Returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A person that is liable for tax under Sec. 41.4481-2(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), (C), or (D), after taking into account the modification required under Sec. 41.4481-2(a)(2), is treated as liable for tax by the same provision of Sec. 41.4481-2(a)(1)(i) for purposes of this section and must file a return.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Required use of electronic filing--(1) In general. A person that files any return reporting 25 or more vehicles must file the return electronically, as prescribed by the Commissioner. For this purpose, the number of vehicles reported on a return is the total

number of vehicles for which tax is reported and does not include vehicles for which a suspension of tax is claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A person that files any return reporting 25 or more vehicles must file the return electronically, as prescribed by the Commissioner. For this purpose, the number of vehicles reported on a return is the total

number of vehicles for which tax is reported and does not include vehicles for which a suspension of tax is claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A has 100 vehicles registered in its name, all of which have a taxable gross weight in excess of 55,000 pounds. Seventy-five of the vehicles are in use on July 1. Twenty-five are in dead storage as described in Sec. 41.4482(c)-1(c). The vehicles in dead storage are not in use and they are not listed on the Schedule 1. A files Form 2290 electronically for the 75 vehicles in use on July 1 and receives a receipted Schedule 1. On August 23 of the same calendar year, A uses the remaining 25 vehicles. A does not file Form 2290 electronically but uses a paper Form 2290. A has failed to meet the requirements of section 4481(e) for the remaining 25 vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that on August 23, A uses 15 of the vehicles that were not used in July. The remaining 10 vehicles are not used in August. A does not file Form 2290 electronically but uses a paper Form 2290. A has correctly filed a return as required by section 4481(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) of this section apply to returns filed on and after July 1, 2015. For rules applicable before that date, see 26 CFR 41.6011(a)-1 (revised as of April 1, 2014).</p>
