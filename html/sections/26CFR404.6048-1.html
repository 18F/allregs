Form 3520-A must be filed even if the taxpayer is treated  as the owner of a foreign trust under both section 679 and some other  provision of subpart E of part I of subchapter J.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Joint returns. If the taxpayer's spouse is also subject to tax  under section 679 with respect to the same foreign trust for the same  taxable year, and if both taxpayer and spouse file a joint return of  income tax for that year, a single Form 3520-A may be filed jointly with  respect to such trust for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Period covered by return. The period covered by the return  required by this section is the taxable year of the taxpayer required to  file the return, regardless of the period used by the trust for  accounting or any other purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Time for filing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The return required by this  section must be filed no later than the 15th day of the fourth month  following the end of the taxable period covered by the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transitional rule.

(Sec. 6048(c), Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 90 Stat. 1616 (26 U.S.C.  6048(c)))  [T.D. 7502, 42 FR 41856, Aug. 19, 1977]    Sec. 404.6334(d)-1  Minimum exemption from levy for wages, salary, or other income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(9)</em>, however, certain amounts payable to or received by  an individual as wages or salary for personal services, or as income  from other sources, are exempt from levy. Under section 6334(d), amounts  so exempt are determined by taking into account (1) the individual's  payroll period, i.e., the basis (whether weekly, biweekly, semimonthly,  monthly or otherwise) on which the individual is paid or receives   wages, salary, or other income, and (2) the number of certain other  persons dependent upon the individual for their support during each such  payroll period. Paragraph (b) of this section prescribes rules for  determining an individual's payroll period. Paragraph (c) of this  section contains rules relating to the minimum amount of wages, salary,  or other income which is exempt from levy for each such payroll period,  and the additional amount which is exempt for each person who is claimed  as a dependent of the individual pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of payroll period. For purposes of determining the  amount of wages, salary, or other income exempt from levy pursuant to  section 6334(a)(9) and this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Regularly used calendar periods. In the case of a levy on wages,  etc. paid on the basis of an established calendar period regularly used  by the employer for payroll purposes (e.g., weekly, biweekly,  semimonthly, or monthly), that period shall be used as the individual's  payroll period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remuneration paid on an irregular basis. In the case of a levy  on wages, etc. not paid on the basis of an established calendar period  regularly used by an employer for payroll purposes, the first day of the  individual's payroll period shall be that day following the day upon  which the wages, salary, or other income become payable to or are  received by the individual, and the last day of the payroll period shall  be that day upon which such wages, salary, or other income next become  payable to or are received by him.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of exempt amount. For each payroll period  determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, amounts exempt  from levy pursuant to section 6334(a)(9) and this section are as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If such payroll period is weekly: $50, plus $15 for each person  who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such payroll period is biweekly: $100, plus $30 for each  person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If such payroll period is semimonthly: $108.33, plus $32.50 for  each person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If such payroll period is monthly: $216.67, plus $65 for each  person who is claimed as a dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If such payroll period is not weekly, biweekly, semimonthly or  monthly: a proportionate amount based upon the sum of an annual  exemption of $2,600 plus $780 for each person who is claimed as a  dependent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Dependent exemption--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dependent defined. For purposes of this  section, a person is a dependent of an individual for any payroll period  of such individual, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Over half of such person's support for such payroll period was  received from the individual, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such person is the spouse of the individual, or bears a  relationship to the individual specified in section 152(a) (1) through  (9) (relating to definition of dependent), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Such person is not a minor child of the individual with  respect to whom amounts are exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(8)  (relating to exemption from levy for judgments for support of minor  children) at any time during such payroll period.  For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, ``payroll  period'' shall be substituted for ``taxable year'' each place it appears  in section 152(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Claim for dependent exemption. No amount prescribed by paragraph  (c) of this section as being exempt from levy for each person who is  claimed as a dependent pursuant to this paragraph shall be so exempt  unless there is delivered to the employer or other person upon whom  notice of levy is served a written statement, signed by the individual  seeking such exemption and containing a declaration that it is made  under the penalties of perjury, which identifies, by name and by  relationship to such individual, each person for whom a dependent  exemption is claimed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Cross references. (1) For the requirement for notice of intent  to levy on salary or wages, see section 6331(d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For the continuing effect of a levy on salary or wages, see  section 6331(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For other property exempt from levy, see section 6334 and Sec.  301.6334-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. The regulations prescribed by this section shall  apply with respect to levies on wages, salary, and other income made  after February 28, 1977.
