They assist in the contracting officer's  determination of fair and reasonable price. They should be based on the  results of the contracting officer's analysis of the offeror's proposal,  taking into consideration all pertinent information including field  pricing assistance, audit reports and technical analysis, fact-finding  results, independent Government cost estimates and price histories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The contracting officer shall establish prenegotiation  objectives before the negotiation of any pricing action. The scope and  depth of the analysis supporting the objectives should be directly  related to the dollar value, importance, and complexity of the pricing  action. When cost analysis is required, the contracting officer shall   document the pertinent issues to be negotiated, the cost objectives, and  a profit or fee objective.</p>
