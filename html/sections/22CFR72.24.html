If rival claimants, executors or administrators demand the personal estate in the consular officer's possession, the officer should not release the estate to any

claimant until a legally binding agreement in writing has been reached or until the dispute is settled by a court of competent jurisdiction, and/or the Department has approved the release.</p>
