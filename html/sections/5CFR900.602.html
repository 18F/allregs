Merit personnel systems are required for  State and local personnel engaged in the administration of assistance  and other intergovernmental programs, irrespective of the source of  funds for their salaries, where Federal laws or regulations require the  establishment and maintenance of such systems. A reasonable number of  positions, however, may be exempted from merit personnel system  coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 900.605 applies to Federal agencies that operate Federal  assistance or intergovernmental programs.</p>
