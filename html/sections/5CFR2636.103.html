                                Sec. 2636.103  Advisory opinions.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for an advisory opinion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee may request an  advisory opinion from an agency ethics official as to whether specific  conduct which has not yet occurred would violate any provision contained  in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An advisory opinion may not be obtained for the purpose of  establishing whether a noncareer employee who is subject to the  restrictions in subpart C of this part may receive compensation for  teaching. An advisory opinion issued under this section may not be  substituted for the advance written approval required by Sec. 2636.307  of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employee's request for an advisory opinion shall be  submitted in writing, shall be dated and signed, and shall include all  information reasonably available to the employee that is relevant to the  inquiry. Where, in the opinion of the agency ethics official, complete  information has not been provided, that official may request the  employee to furnish additional information necessary to issue an  opinion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance of advisory opinion. As soon as practicable after  receipt of all necessary information, the agency ethics official shall  issue a written opinion as to whether the conduct in issue would violate  any provision contained in this part. Where conduct which would not  violate this part would violate another statute relating to conflicts of  interest or applicable standards of conduct, the advisory opinion shall  so state and shall caution the employee against engaging in the conduct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of issuing an advisory opinion, the agency  ethics official may request additional information   from agency sources, including the requesting employee's supervisor, and  may rely upon the accuracy of information furnished by the requester or  any agency source unless he has reason to believe that the information  is fraudulent, misleading or otherwise incorrect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the request and advisory opinion shall be retained for  a period of 6 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Good faith reliance on an advisory opinion. An employee who  engages in conduct in good faith reliance upon an advisory opinion  issued to him under this section shall not be subject to civil or  disciplinary action for having violated this part. Where an employee  engages in conduct in good faith reliance upon an advisory opinion  issued by an ethics official of his agency to another, neither the  Office of Government Ethics nor the employing agency shall initiate  civil or disciplinary action under this part for conduct that is  indistinguishable in all material aspects from the conduct described in  the advisory opinion. However, an advisory opinion issued under this  section shall not insulate the employee from other civil or disciplinary  action if his conduct violates any other laws, rule, regulation or  lawful management policy or directive. Where an employee has actual  knowledge or reason to believe that the opinion is based on fraudulent,  misleading, or otherwise incorrect information, the employee's reliance  on the opinion will not be deemed to be in good faith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revision of an ethics opinion. Nothing in this section prohibits  an agency ethics official from revising an ethics opinion on a  prospective basis where he determines that the ethics opinion previously  issued is incorrect, either as a matter of law or because it is based on  erroneous information.
