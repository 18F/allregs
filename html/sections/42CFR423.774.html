                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determinations of whether an individual is a subsidy eligible individual. Determinations of eligibility for subsidies under this subpart are made by the State under its State plan under title XIX of the Act if the individual applies with the Medicaid agency, or if the individual applies with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Commissioner of Social Security in accordance with the requirements of section 1860D-14(a)(3) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date of initial eligibility determinations. Initial eligibility determinations are effective beginning with the first day of the month in which the individual applies, but no earlier than January 1, 2006 and remain in effect for a period not to exceed 1 year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Redeterminations and appeals of low-income subsidy eligibility--(1) Redeterminations and appeals of low-income subsidy eligibility determinations--eligibility determinations made by States. Redeterminations and appeals of low-income subsidy eligibility determinations by States must be made in the same manner and frequency as the redeterminations and appeals are made under the State's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Redeterminations and appeals of low-income subsidy eligibility--eligibility determinations made by Commissioner of Social Security. Redeterminations and appeals of eligibility determinations made by the Commissioner will be made in the manner specified by the Commissioner of Social Security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application requirements. (1) In order for applications for the subsidies under this subpart to be considered complete, applicants or personal representatives applying on the individual's behalf, must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Complete all required elements of the application; (ii) Provide any statements from financial institutions, as requested, to support information in the application; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certify, under penalty of perjury or similar sanction for false statements, as to the accuracy of the information provided on the application form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiple applications. If the individual or his or her personal representative has previously filed an application with the State or SSA which seeks subsidy eligibility for any portion of the eligibility period covered by a subsequent application, the later application is void if the individual has received a positive subsidy determination on that earlier application from the State or SSA.</p>
