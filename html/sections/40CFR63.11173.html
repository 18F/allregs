                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each paint stripping operation that is an affected area source must implement management practices to minimize the evaporative emissions of MeCl. The management practices must address, at a minimum, the practices in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as applicable, for your operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evaluate each application to ensure there is a need for paint stripping (e.g., evaluate whether it is possible to re-coat the piece without removing the existing coating).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluate each application where a paint stripper containing MeCl is used to ensure that there is no alternative paint stripping technology that can be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reduce exposure of all paint strippers containing MeCl to the air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Optimize application conditions when using paint strippers containing MeCl to reduce MeCl evaporation (e.g., if the stripper must be heated, make sure that the temperature is kept as low as possible to reduce evaporation).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Practice proper storage and disposal of paint strippers containing MeCl (e.g., store stripper in closed, air-tight containers).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each paint stripping operation that has annual usage of more than one ton of MeCl must develop and implement a written MeCl minimization plan to minimize the use and emissions of MeCl. The MeCl minimization plan must address, at a minimum, the management practices specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as applicable, for your operations. Each operation must post a placard or sign

outlining the MeCl minimization plan in each area where paint stripping operations subject to this subpart occur. Paint stripping operations with annual usage of less than one ton of MeCl, must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section, as applicable, but are not required to develop and implement a written MeCl minimization plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each paint stripping operation must maintain copies of annual usage of paint strippers containing MeCl on site at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each paint stripping operation with annual usage of more than one ton of MeCl must maintain a copy of their current MeCl minimization plan on site at all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each motor vehicle and mobile equipment surface coating operation and each miscellaneous surface coating operation must meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All painters must be certified that they have completed training in the proper spray application of surface coatings and the proper setup and maintenance of spray equipment. The minimum requirements for training and certification are described in paragraph (f) of this section. The spray application of surface coatings is prohibited by persons who are not certified as having completed the training described in paragraph (f) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to the students of an accredited surface coating training program who are under the direct supervision of an instructor who meets the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All spray-applied coatings must be applied in a spray booth, preparation station, or mobile enclosure that meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section and either paragraph (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), or (e)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All spray booths, preparation stations, and mobile enclosures must be fitted with a type of filter technology that is demonstrated to achieve at least 98-percent capture of paint overspray. The procedure used to demonstrate filter efficiency must be consistent with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Method 52.1, ``Gravimetric and Dust-Spot Procedures for Testing Air-Cleaning Devices Used in General Ventilation for Removing Particulate Matter, June 4, 1992'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of this part). The test coating for measuring filter efficiency shall be a high solids bake enamel delivered at a rate of at least 135 grams per minute from a conventional (non-HVLP) air-atomized spray gun operating at 40 pounds per square inch (psi) air pressure; the air flow rate across the filter shall be 150 feet per minute. Owners and operators may use published filter efficiency data provided by filter vendors to demonstrate compliance with this requirement and are not required to perform this measurement. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to waterwash spray booths that are operated and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Spray booths and preparation stations used to refinish complete motor vehicles or mobile equipment must be fully enclosed with a full roof, and four complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be ventilated at negative pressure so that air is drawn into any openings in the booth walls or preparation station curtains. However, if a spray booth is fully enclosed and has seals on all doors and other openings and has an automatic pressure balancing system, it may be operated at up to, but not more than, 0.05 inches water gauge positive pressure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Spray booths and preparation stations that are used to coat miscellaneous parts and products or vehicle subassemblies must have a full roof, at least three complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be ventilated so that air is drawn into the booth. The walls and roof of a booth may have openings, if needed, to allow for conveyors and parts to pass through the booth during the coating process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mobile ventilated enclosures that are used to perform spot repairs must enclose and, if necessary, seal against the surface around the area being coated such that paint overspray is retained within the enclosure and directed to a filter to capture paint overspray.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All spray-applied coatings must be applied with a high volume, low pressure (HVLP) spray gun, electrostatic application, airless spray gun, air-assisted airless spray gun, or an equivalent technology that is demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to achieve transfer efficiency comparable to one of the spray gun technologies listed above for a comparable operation, and for which written approval has been obtained from the Administrator. The procedure used to demonstrate that spray gun transfer efficiency is equivalent to that of an HVLP spray gun must be equivalent to the California South Coast Air Quality Management District's ``Spray Equipment Transfer Efficiency Test Procedure for Equipment User, May 24, 1989'' and ``Guidelines for Demonstrating Equivalency with District Approved Transfer Efficient Spray Guns, September 26, 2002'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of this part). The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to painting performed by students and instructors at paint training centers. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to the surface coating of aerospace vehicles that involves the coating of components that normally require the use of an airbrush or an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces; to the application of coatings on aerospace vehicles that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns; or to the application of coatings on aerospace vehicles that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0013 centimeter (0.0005 in.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All paint spray gun cleaning must be done so that an atomized mist or spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is not created outside of a container that collects used gun cleaning solvent. Spray gun cleaning may be done with, for example, hand cleaning of parts of the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by flushing solvent through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint residue, or by using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of non-atomizing methods may also be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), we, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, may choose to grant you permission to use an alternative to the emission standards in this section after you have requested approval to do so according to Sec. 63.6(g)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each owner or operator of an affected miscellaneous surface coating source must ensure and certify that all new and existing personnel, including contract personnel, who spray apply surface coatings, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, are trained in the proper application of surface coatings as required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The training program must include, at a minimum, the items listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of all current personnel by name and job description who are required to be trained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hands-on and classroom instruction that addresses, at a minimum, initial and refresher training in the topics listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spray gun equipment selection, set up, and operation, including measuring coating viscosity, selecting the proper fluid tip or nozzle, and achieving the proper spray pattern, air pressure and volume, and fluid delivery rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Spray technique for different types of coatings to improve transfer efficiency and minimize coating usage and overspray, including maintaining the correct spray gun distance and angle to the part, using proper banding and overlap, and reducing lead and lag spraying at the beginning and end of each stroke.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Routine spray booth and filter maintenance, including filter selection and installation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Environmental compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the methods to be used at the completion of initial or refresher training to demonstrate, document, and provide certification of successful completion of the required training. Owners and operators who can show by documentation or certification that a painter's work experience and/or training has resulted in training equivalent to the training required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are not required to provide the initial training

required by that paragraph to these painters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> As required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, all new and existing personnel at an affected motor vehicle and mobile equipment or miscellaneous surface coating source, including contract personnel, who spray apply surface coatings, as defined in Sec. 63.11180, must be trained by the dates specified in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. Employees who transfer within a company to a position as a painter are subject to the same requirements as a new hire.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If your source is a new source, all personnel must be trained and certified no later than 180 days after hiring or no later than July 7, 2008, whichever is later. Painter training that was completed within five years prior to the date training is required, and that meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section satisfies this requirement and is valid for a period not to exceed five years after the date the training is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If your source is an existing source, all personnel must be trained and certified no later than 180 days after hiring or no later than January 10, 2011, whichever is later. Painter training that was completed within five years prior to the date training is required, and that meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section satisfies this requirement and is valid for a period not to exceed five years after the date the training is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Training and certification will be valid for a period not to exceed five years after the date the training is completed, and all personnel must receive refresher training that meets the requirements of this section and be re-certified every five years.
