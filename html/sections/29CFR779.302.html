                                Sec. 779.302  Exemptions depend on character of establishment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Some exemptions depend on the character of the establishment by  which an employee is employed. These include the ``retail or service  establishment'' exemptions in sections 13(a) (2), (4), and (11) and the  exemptions available to the establishments of the character specified in  sections 13(a) (3), (9), and   13(b)(8) (first part). Therefore, if the establishment meets the tests  enumerated in these sections, employees ``employed by'' that  establishment are generally exempt from sections 6 and 7. (See  Sec. Sec. 779.307 to 779.309 discussing ``employed by.'') Other  exemptions establish two criteria, the character of the establishment  and the nature of the conditions of the employment of the particular  employee. Such exemptions are set forth in section 13(b)(8) (second  part), and section 13(b)(18) and (19). To determine whether the  exemptions of these sections apply it is necessary to determine both  that the establishment meets the enumerated tests and that the employee  is engaged in the enumerated activities or employed under the conditions  specified. Thus, under section 13(b)(18) some of the employees of a  given employer may be exempt from the overtime pay requirements (but not  the minimum wage) of the Act, while others may not.    Sec. 779.303  ``Establishment'' defined; distinguished from  ``enterprise'' and ``business.''</p><p class="depth0">As previously stated in Sec. 779.23, the term establishment as used  in the Act means a distinct physical place of business. The  ``enterprise,'' by reason of the definition contained in section 3(r) of  the Act and the tests enumerated in section 3(s) of the Act, may be  composed of a single establishment. The term ``establishment,'' however,  is not synonymous with the words ``business'' or ``enterprise'' when  those terms are used to describe multiunit operations. In such a  multiunit operation some of the establishments may qualify for  exemption, others may not. For example, a manufacturer may operate a  plant for production of its goods, a separate warehouse for storage and  distribution, and several stores from which its products are sold. Each  such physically separate place of business is a separate establishment.  In the case of chain store systems, branch stores, groups of independent  stores organized to carry on business in a manner similar to chain store  systems, and retail outlets operated by manufacturing or distributing  concerns, each separate place of business ordinarily is a separate  establishment.</p>
