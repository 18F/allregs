                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(3)</em> of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must not import or attempt to import any rodents, whether  dead or alive, that were obtained, directly or indirectly, from Africa,  or whose native habitat is Africa, any products derived from such  rodents, any other animal, whether dead or alive, whose importation the  Director has prohibited by order, or any products derived from such  animals; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You must not prevent or attempt to prevent the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from causing an animal to be  quarantined, re-exported, or destroyed under a written order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prohibitions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not  apply if you have written permission from CDC to import a rodent that  was obtained, directly or indirectly, from Africa, or whose native  habitat is Africa, or an animal whose importation the Director has  prohibited by order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To obtain such written permission from CDC, you must send a  written request to Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National  Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd., Atlanta, GA 30333. You may also fax your  request to the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (using the  same address in the previous sentence) at 404-498-1633.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your request must state the reasons why you need an exemption,  describe the animals involved, describe the number of animals involved,  describe how the animals will be transported (including carrying  containers or cages, precautions for handlers, types of vehicles used,  and other procedures to minimize exposure of animals and precautions to  prevent animals from escaping into the environment), describe any  holding facilities, quarantine procedures, and/or veterinarian  evaluation involved in the animals' movement, and explain why an  exemption will not result in the spread of monkeypox within the United  States. Your request must be limited to scientific, exhibition, or  educational purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> We will respond in writing to all requests, and we also may  impose conditions in granting an exemption. If we deny your request, you  may appeal that denial. Your appeal must be in writing and be submitted  to the CDC official whose office denied your request, and you must  submit the appeal within two business days after you receive the denial.  Your appeal must state the reasons for the appeal and show that there is  a genuine and substantial issue of fact in dispute. We will issue a  written response to the appeal, which shall constitute final agency  action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply  to products derived from rodents that were obtained, directly or  indirectly, from Africa, or whose native habitat is Africa, or products  derived from any other animal whose importation the Director has  prohibited by order if such products have been properly processed to  render them noninfectious so that they pose no risk of transmitting or  carrying the monkeypox virus. Such products include, but are not limited  to, fully taxidermied animals and completely finished trophies; and they  may be imported without written permission from CDC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What actions can CDC take? (1) To prevent the monkeypox virus  from spreading and becoming established in the United States, we may, in  addition to any other authorities under this part:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Issue an order causing an animal to be placed in quarantine,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Issue an order causing an animal to be re-exported,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Issue an order causing an animal to be destroyed, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Take any other action necessary to prevent the spread of the  monkeypox virus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any order causing an animal to be quarantined, re-exported, or  destroyed will be in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> How do I appeal an order? If you received a written order to  quarantine or re-export an animal or to cause an animal to be destroyed,  you may appeal that order. Your appeal must be in writing and be  submitted to the CDC official whose office issued the order, and you  must submit the appeal within 2 business days after you receive the  order. Your appeal must state the reasons for the appeal and show that  there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact in dispute. We will  issue a written response to the appeal, which shall constitute final  agency action.  [68 FR 62369, Nov. 4, 2003]</p>
