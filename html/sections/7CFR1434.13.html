Subject to the provisions of Sec. 1434.17, a producer who wishes to liquidate all or part of a loan by contracting for the sale of the honey must obtain written approval from the county office on a form prescribed by CCC to remove a specified quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the county office.</p>
