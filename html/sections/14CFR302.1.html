Subpart A of this part sets forth general rules  applicable to all types of proceedings. Each of the other subparts of  this part sets forth special rules applicable to the type of proceedings  described in the title of the subpart. Therefore, for information as to  applicable rules, reference should be made to subpart A and to the rules  in the subpart relating to the particular type of proceeding, if any. In  addition, reference should be made to Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the  United States Code (Transportation) (``the Statute''), and to the  substantive rules, regulations and orders of the Department relating to  the proceeding. Wherever there is any conflict between one of the  general rules in subpart A and a special rule in another subpart  applicable to a particular type of proceeding, the special rule will  govern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reference to part and method of citing rules. This part may be  referred to as the ``Rules of Practice''. Each section, and any  paragraph or subparagraph thereof, may be referred to as a ``Rule''. The  number of each rule need include only the numbers and letters at the  right of the decimal point. For example, ``302.7 Service of documents'',  may be referred to as ``Rule 7''.</p>
