Appendix B to Part 236--Risk Assessment Criteria</p><p class="depth0">The safety-critical performance of each product for which risk assessment is required under this part must be assessed in accordance with the following minimum criteria or other criteria if demonstrated to the Associate Administrator for Safety to be equally suitable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> How are risk metrics to be expressed? The risk metric for the proposed product must describe with a high degree of confidence the accumulated risk of a train control system that operates over the designated life-cycle of the product. Each risk metric for the proposed product must be expressed with an upper bound, as estimated with a sensitivity analysis, and the risk value selected must be demonstrated to have a high degree of confidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> How does the risk assessment handle interaction risks for interconnected subsystems/components? The risk assessment of each safety-critical system (product) must account not only for the risks associated with each subsystem or component, but also for the risks associated with interactions (interfaces) between such subsystems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What is the main principle in computing risk for the previous and current conditions? The risk for the previous condition must be computed using the same metrics as for the new system being proposed. A full risk assessment must consider the entire railroad environment where the product is being applied, and show all aspects of the previous condition that are affected by the installation of the product, considering all faults, operating errors, exposure scenarios, and consequences that are related as described in this part. For the full risk assessment, the total societal cost of the potential numbers of accidents assessed for both previous and new system conditions must be computed for comparison. An abbreviated risk assessment must, as a minimum, clearly compute the MTTHE for all of the hazardous events identified for both previous and current conditions. The comparison between MTTHE for both conditions is to determine whether the product implementation meets the safety criteria as required by subpart H or subpart I of this part as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What major system characteristics must be included when relevant to risk assessment? Each risk calculation must consider the total signaling and train control system and method of operation, as subjected to a list of hazards to be mitigated by the signaling and train control system. The methodology requirements must include the following major characteristics, when they are relevant to the product being considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Track plan infrastructure, switches, rail crossings at grade and highway-rail grade crossings as applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Train movement density for freight, work, and passenger trains where applicable and computed over a time span of not less than 12 months;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Train movement operational rules, as enforced by the dispatcher, roadway worker/Employee in Charge, and train crew behaviors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Wayside subsystems and components;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Onboard subsystems and components;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Consist contents such as hazardous material, oversize loads; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Operating speeds if the provisions of part 236 cite additional requirements for certain type of train control systems to be used at such speeds for freight and passenger trains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> What other relevant parameters must be determined for the subsystems and components? In order to derive the frequency of hazardous events (or MTTHE) applicable for a product, subsystem or component included in the risk assessment, the railroad may use various techniques, such as reliability and availability calculations for subsystems and components, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) of the subsystems, and results of the application of safety design principles as noted in Appendix C to this part. The MTTHE is to be derived for both fail-safe and non-fail-safe subsystems or components. The lower bounds of the MTTF or MTBF determined from the system sensitivity analysis, which account for all necessary and well justified assumptions, may be used to represent the estimate of MTTHE for the associated non-fail-safe subsystem or component in the risk assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> How are processor-based subsystems/components assessed? (1) An MTTHE value must be calculated for each processor-based subsystem or component, or both, indicating the safety-critical behavior of the integrated hardware/software subsystem or component, or both. The human factor impact must be included in the assessment, whenever applicable, to provide the integrated MTTHE value. The MTTHE calculation must consider the rates of failures caused by permanent, transient, and intermittent faults accounting for the fault coverage of the integrated hardware/software subsystem or component, phased-interval maintenance, and restoration of the detected failures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Software fault/failure analysis must be based on the assessment of the design and implementation of all safety-related software including the application code, its operating/executive program, COTS software, and associated device drivers, as well as historical performance data, analytical methods and experimental safety-critical performance testing performed on the subsystem or component. The software assessment process must demonstrate through repeatable predictive results that all software defects have

been identified and corrected by process with a high degree of confidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> How are non-processor-based subsystems/components assessed? (1) The safety-critical behavior of all non-processor-based components, which are part of a processor-based system or subsystem, must be quantified with an MTTHE metric. The MTTHE assessment methodology must consider failures caused by permanent, transient, and intermittent faults, phase-interval maintenance and restoration of operation after failures and the effect of fault coverage of each non-processor-based subsystem or component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> MTTHE compliance verification and validation must be based on the assessment of the design for adequacy by a documented verification and validation process, historical performance data, analytical methods and experimental safety-critical performance testing performed on the subsystem or component. The non-processor-based quantification compliance must be demonstrated to have a high degree of confidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> What assumptions must be documented for risk assessment? (1) The railroad shall document any assumptions regarding the derivation of risk metrics used. For example, for the full risk assessment, all assumptions made about each value of the parameters used in the calculation of total cost of accidents should be documented. For abbreviated risk assessment, all assumptions made for MTHHE derivation using existing reliability and availability data on the current system components should be documented. The railroad shall document these assumptions in such a form as to permit later comparisons with in-service experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The railroad shall document any assumptions regarding human performance. The documentation shall be in such a form as to facilitate later comparisons with in-service experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The railroad shall document any assumptions regarding software defects. These assumptions shall be in a form that permit the railroad to project the likelihood of detecting an in-service software defect. These assumptions shall be documented in such a form as to permit later comparisons with in-service experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The railroad shall document all of the identified safety-critical fault paths to a mishap as predicted by the safety analysis methodology. The documentation shall be in such a form as to facilitate later comparisons with in-service faults.
[75 FR 2717, Jan. 15, 2010]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 236--Safety Assurance Criteria and Processes</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this appendix? This appendix provides safety criteria and processes that the designer must use to develop and validate the product that meets safety requirements of this part. FRA uses the criteria and processes set forth in this appendix to evaluate the validity of safety targets and the results of system safety analyses provided in the RSPP, PSP, PTCIP, PTCDP, and PTCSP documents as appropriate. An analysis performed under this appendix must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Address each of the safety principles of paragraph (b) of this appendix, or explain why they are not relevant, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employ a validation and verification process pursuant to paragraph (c) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What safety principles must be followed during product development? The designer shall address each of the following safety considerations principles when designing and demonstrating the safety of products covered by subpart H or I of this part. In the event that any of these principles are not followed, the PSP or PTCDP or PTCSP shall state both the reason(s) for departure and the alternative(s) utilized to mitigate or eliminate the hazards associated with the design principle not followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> System safety under normal operating conditions. The system (all its elements including hardware and software) must be designed to assure safe operation with no hazardous events under normal anticipated operating conditions with proper inputs and within the expected range of environmental conditions. All safety-critical functions must be performed properly under these normal conditions. The system shall operate safely even in the absence of prescribed operator actions or procedures. The designer must identify and categorize all hazards that may lead to unsafe system operation. Hazards categorized as unacceptable, which are determined by hazard analysis, must be eliminated by design. Best effort shall also be made by the designer to eliminate by design the hazards categorized as undesirable. Those undesirable hazards that cannot be eliminated should be mitigated to the acceptable level as required by this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> System safety under failures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It must be shown how the product is designed to eliminate or mitigate unsafe systematic failures--those conditions which can be attributed to human error that could occur at various stages throughout product development. This includes unsafe errors in the software due to human error in the software specification, design, or coding phases; human errors that could impact hardware design; unsafe conditions that could occur because of an improperly designed human-machine interface; installation and maintenance errors; and errors associated with making modifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The product must be shown to operate safely under conditions of random hardware

failures. This includes single hardware failures as well as multiple hardware failures that may occur at different times but remain undetected (latent) and react in combination with a subsequent failure at a later time to cause an unsafe operating situation. In instances involving a latent failure, a subsequent failure is similar to there being a single failure. In the event of a transient failure, and if so designed, the system should restart itself if it is safe to do so. Frequency of attempted restarts must be considered in the hazard analysis required by Sec. 236.907(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There shall be no single point failures in the product that can result in hazards categorized as unacceptable or undesirable. Occurrence of credible single point failures that can result in hazards must be detected and the product must achieve a known safe state that eliminates the possibility of false activation of any physical appliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If one non-self-revealing failure combined with a second failure can cause a hazard that is categorized as unacceptable or undesirable, then the second failure must be detected and the product must achieve a known safe state that eliminates the possibility of false activation of any physical appliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Another concern of multiple failures involves common mode failures in which two or more subsystems or components intended to compensate one another to perform the same function all fail by the same mode and result in unsafe conditions. This is of particular concern in instances in which two or more elements (hardware or software, or both) are used in combination to ensure safety. If a common mode failure exists, then any analysis performed under this appendix cannot rely on the assumption that failures are independent. Examples include: The use of redundancy in which two or more elements perform a given function in parallel and when one (hardware or software) element checks/monitors another element (of hardware or software) to help ensure its safe operation. Common mode failure relates to independence, which must be ensured in these instances. When dealing with the effects of hardware failure, the designer shall address the effects of the failure not only on other hardware, but also on the execution of the software, since hardware failures can greatly affect how the software operates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Closed loop principle. System design adhering to the closed loop principle requires that all conditions necessary for the existence of any permissive state or action be verified to be present before the permissive state or action can be initiated. Likewise the requisite conditions shall be verified to be continuously present for the permissive state or action to be maintained. This is in contrast to allowing a permissive state or action to be initiated or maintained in the absence of detected failures. In addition, closed loop design requires that failure to perform a logical operation, or absence of a logical input, output or decision shall not cause an unsafe condition, i.e. system safety does not depend upon the occurrence of an action or logical decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Safety assurance concepts. The product design must include one or more of the following Safety Assurance Concepts as described in IEEE-1483 standard to ensure that failures are detected and the product is placed in a safe state. One or more different principles may be applied to each individual subsystem or component, depending on the safety design objectives of that part of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Design diversity and self-checking concept. This concept requires that all critical functions be performed in diverse ways, using diverse software operations and/or diverse hardware channels, and that critical hardware be tested with Self-Checking routines. Permissive outputs are allowed only if the results of the diverse operations correspond, and the Self-Checking process reveals no failures in either execution of software or in any monitored input or output hardware. If the diverse operations do not agree or if the checking reveals critical failures, safety-critical functions and outputs must default to a known safe state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Checked redundancy concept. The Checked Redundancy concept requires implementation of two or more identical, independent hardware units, each executing identical software and performing identical functions. A means is to be provided to periodically compare vital parameters and results of the independent redundant units, requiring agreement of all compared parameters to assert or maintain a permissive output. If the units do not agree, safety-critical functions and outputs must default to a known safe state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> N-version programming concept. This concept requires a processor-based product to use at least two software programs performing identical functions and executing concurrently in a cycle. The software programs must be written by independent teams, using different tools. The multiple independently written software programs comprise a redundant system, and may be executed either on separate hardware units (which may or may not be identical) or within one hardware unit. A means is to be provided to compare the results and output states of the multiple redundant software systems. If the system results do not agree, then the safety-critical functions and outputs must default to a known safe state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Numerical assurance concept. This concept requires that the state of each vital parameter of the product or system be uniquely represented by a large encoded numerical value, such that permissive results are calculated by pseudo-randomly combining the

representative numerical values of each of the critical constituent parameters of a permissive decision. Vital algorithms must be entirely represented by data structures containing numerical values with verified characteristics, and no vital decisions are to be made in the executing software, only by the numerical representations themselves. In the event of critical failures, the safety-critical functions and outputs must default to a known safe state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Intrinsic fail-safe design concept. Intrinsically fail-safe hardware circuits or systems are those that employ discrete mechanical and/or electrical components. The fail-safe operation for a product or subsystem designed using this principle concept requires a verification that the effect of every relevant failure mode of each component, and relevant combinations of component failure modes, be considered, analyzed, and documented. This is typically performed by a comprehensive failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) which must show no residual unmitigated failures. In the event of critical failures, the safety-critical functions and outputs must default to a known safe state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Human factor engineering principle. The product design must sufficiently incorporate human factors engineering that is appropriate to the complexity of the product; the educational, mental, and physical capabilities of the intended operators and maintainers; the degree of required human interaction with the component; and the environment in which the product will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> System safety under external influences. The product must be shown to operate safely when subjected to different external influences, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Electrical influences such as power supply anomalies/transients, abnormal/improper input conditions (e.g., outside of normal range inputs relative to amplitude and frequency, unusual combinations of inputs) including those related to a human operator, and others such as electromagnetic interference or electrostatic discharges, or both;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mechanical influences such as vibration and shock; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Climatic conditions such as temperature and humidity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> System safety after modifications. Safety must be ensured following modifications to the hardware or software, or both. All or some of the concerns identified in this paragraph may be applicable depending upon the nature and extent of the modifications. Such modifications must follow all of the concept, design, implementation and test processes and principles as documented in the PSP for the original product. Regression testing must be comprehensive and documented to include all scenarios which are affected by the change made, and the operating modes of the changed product during normal and failure state (fallback) operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What standards are acceptable for Verification and Validation? (1) The standards employed for Verification or Validation, or both, of products subject to this subpart must be sufficient to support achievement of the applicable requirements of subpart H and subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard (MIL-STD) 882C, ``System Safety Program Requirements'' (January 19, 1993), is recognized as providing appropriate risk analysis processes for incorporation into verification and validation standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following standards designed for application to processor-based signal and train control systems are recognized as acceptable with respect to applicable elements of safety analysis required by subpart H and subpart I of this part.

Appendix E to Part 236--Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Design</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This appendix provides human factors design criteria applicable to both subpart H and subpart I of this part. HMI design criteria will minimize negative safety effects by causing designers to consider human factors in the development of HMIs. The product design should sufficiently incorporate human factors engineering that is appropriate to the complexity of the product; the gender, educational, mental, and physical capabilities of the intended operators and maintainers; the degree of required human interaction with the component; and the environment in which the product will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As used in this section, ``designer'' means anyone who specifies requirements for--or designs a system or subsystem, or both, for--a product subject to subpart H or subpart I of this part, and ``operator'' means any human who is intended to receive information from, provide information to, or perform repairs or maintenance on a safety-critical product subject to subpart H or I of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Human factors issues the designers must consider with regard to the general function of a system include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reduced situational awareness and over-reliance. HMI design must give an operator active functions to perform, feedback on the results of the operator's actions, and information on the automatic functions of the system as well as its performance. The operator must be ``in-the-loop.'' Designers must consider at a minimum the following methods of maintaining an active role for human operators:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The system must require an operator to initiate action to operate the train and require an operator to remain ``in-the-loop'' for at least 30 minutes at a time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The system must provide timely feedback to an operator regarding the system's automated actions, the reasons for such actions, and the effects of the operator's manual actions on the system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The system must warn operators in advance when it requires an operator to take action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> HMI design must equalize an operator's workload; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> HMI design must not distract from the operator's safety related duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Expectation of predictability and consistency in product behavior and communications. HMI design must accommodate an operator's expectation of logical and consistent relationships between actions and results. Similar objects must behave consistently when an operator performs the same action upon them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> End user limited ability to process information. HMI design must therefore minimize an operator's information processing load. To minimize information processing load, the designer must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Present integrated information that directly supports the variety and types of decisions that an operator makes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provide information in a format or representation that minimizes the time required to understand and act; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct utility tests of decision aids to establish clear benefits such as processing time saved or improved quality of decisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> End user limited memory. HMI design must therefore minimize an operator's information processing load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To minimize short-term memory load, the designer shall integrate data or information from multiple sources into a single format or representation (``chunking'') and design so that three or fewer ``chunks'' of information need to be remembered at any one time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To minimize long-term memory load, the designer shall design to support recognition memory, design memory aids to minimize the amount of information that must be recalled from unaided memory when making critical decisions, and promote active processing of the information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Design systems that anticipate possible user errors and include capabilities to catch errors before they propagate through the system;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conduct cognitive task analyses prior to designing the system to better understand the information processing requirements of operators when making critical decisions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Present information that accurately represents or predicts system states.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> When creating displays and controls, the designer must consider user ergonomics and shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Locate displays as close as possible to the controls that affect them;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Locate displays and controls based on an operator's position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arrange controls to minimize the need for the operator to change position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Arrange controls according to their expected order of use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Group similar controls together;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Design for high stimulus-response compatibility (geometric and conceptual);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Design safety-critical controls to require more than one positive action to activate (e.g., auto stick shift requires two movements to go into reverse);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Design controls to allow easy recovery from error; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Design display and controls to reflect specific gender and physical limitations of the intended operators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The designer shall also address information management. To that end, HMI design shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Display information in a manner which emphasizes its relative importance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Comply with the ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Utilize a display luminance that has a difference of at least 35cd/m2 between the foreground and background (the displays should be capable of a minimum contrast 3:1 with 7:1 preferred, and controls should be provided to adjust the brightness level and contrast level);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Display only the information necessary to the user;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where text is needed, use short, simple sentences or phrases with wording that an operator will understand and appropriate to the educational and cognitive capabilities of the intended operator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Use complete words where possible; where abbreviations are necessary, choose a commonly accepted abbreviation or consistent method and select commonly used terms and words that the operator will understand;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Adopt a consistent format for all display screens by placing each design element in a consistent and specified location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Display critical information in the center of the operator's field of view by placing items that need to be found quickly in the upper left hand corner and items which are not time-critical in the lower right hand corner of the field of view;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Group items that belong together;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Design all visual displays to meet human performance criteria under monochrome conditions and add color only if it will help the user in performing a task, and use color coding as a redundant coding technique;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Limit the number of colors over a group of displays to no more than seven;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Design warnings to match the level of risk or danger with the alerting nature of the signal; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> With respect to information entry, avoid full QWERTY keyboards for data entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> With respect to problem management, the HMI designer shall ensure that the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> HMI design must enhance an operator's situation awareness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> HMI design must support response selection and scheduling; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> HMI design must support contingency planning.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Ensure that electronics equipment radio frequency emissions are compliant with appropriate Federal Communications Commission regulations.
