Each report  must be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in an electronic format that FDA  can process, review, and archive. FDA will periodically issue guidance  on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of  transmission, media, file formats, preparation and organization of  files). Each report must bear prominent identification of its contents,  i.e., ``bioavailability/bioequivalence safety report.'' The person  conducting the study, including any contract research organization, must  also notify FDA of any fatal or life-threatening adverse event from the  study as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days  after becoming aware of its occurrence. Each notification under this  paragraph must be submitted to the Director, Office of Generic Drugs in  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at FDA. Relevant followup  information to a bioavailability/bioequivalence safety report must be  submitted as soon as the information is available and must be identified  as such, i.e., ``Followup bioavailability/bioequivalence safety  report.'' Upon request from FDA, the person conducting the study,  including any contract research organization, must submit to FDA any  additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon  as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after receiving  the request.
