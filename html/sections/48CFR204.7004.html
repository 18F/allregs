Number amendments to solicitations sequentially using a four position numeric serial number added to the basic PII number and beginning with 0001, e.g., N00062-91-R-1234-0001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Modifications to contracts and agreements.

These are the first two digits in a serial number. They may be either alpha or numeric.

(1) Calls or orders issued by the office issuing the contract or agreement. Use a four position alpha-numeric call or order serial number added to the basic PII number.

The first and second positions contain the call/order code assigned to the ordering office in accordance with 204.7005. Do not use the letters A or P in the first position. The third and fourth positions are a two position serial number assigned by the ordering office. The series will begin with 01. When the numbers exceed 99, the office will assign a uniform series of identifiers containing alpha and/or numeric characters, e.g., Basic : N00383-91-D-0001 serial : TU01.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an office is placing calls against non-DoD blanket purchase agreements or orders under non-DoD issued contracts (including Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts, and multi-agency contracts), or basic ordering agreements, the office shall identify the instrument with a 13 position supplementary PII number using an F in the 9th position. Do not use the same supplementary PII number with an F in the 9th position on more than one order. Modifications to these calls or orders shall be numbered in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Modifications to calls or orders. Use a two position alpha-numeric suffix, known as a call or order modification indicator, to identify a modification to a call or order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Modifications to a call or order issued by a purchasing office begin with 01, 02, and so on through 99, then B1 through B9, BA through BZ, C1 through C9, and so on through ZZ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modifications to a call or order issued by a contract administration office begin with 1A, 1B, and so on through 9Z, followed by A1, A2, and so on to A9, then AA, AB, and so on through AZ.
