                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In any case in which a tax has been assessed within the applicable statutory period of limitations on assessment, a proceeding in court to collect the tax may be commenced, or a levy to collect the tax may be made,

within 10 years after the date of assessment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Agreement to extend the period of limitations on collection. The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to extend the period of limitations on collection in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Extension agreement entered into in connection with an installment agreement. If the Secretary and the taxpayer enter into an installment agreement for the tax liability prior to the expiration of the period of limitations on collection, the Secretary and the taxpayer, at the time the installment agreement is entered into, may enter into a written agreement to extend the period of limitations on collection to a date certain. A written extension agreement entered into under this paragraph shall extend the period of limitations on collection until the 89th day after the date agreed upon in the written agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extension agreement entered into in connection with the release of a levy under section 6343. If the Secretary has levied on any part of the taxpayer's property prior to the expiration of the period of limitations on collection and the levy is subsequently released pursuant to section 6343 after the expiration of the period of limitations on collection, the Secretary and the taxpayer, prior to the release of the levy, may enter into a written agreement to extend the period of limitations on collection to a date certain. A written extension agreement entered into under this paragraph shall extend the period of limitations on collection until the date agreed upon in the extension agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proceeding in court for the collection of the tax. If a proceeding in court for the collection of a tax is begun within the period provided in paragraph (a) of this section (or within any extended period as provided in paragraph (b) of this section), the period during which the tax may be collected by levy is extended until the liability for the tax or a judgment against the taxpayer arising from the liability is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of statutory suspensions of the period of limitations on collection if executed collection extension agreement is in effect. (1) Any statutory suspension of the period of limitations on collection tolls the running of the period of limitations on collection, as extended pursuant to an executed extension agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, for the amount of time set forth in the relevant statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any statutory suspension of the period of limitations on collection tolls the running of the period of limitations on collection, as extended pursuant to an executed extension agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, for the amount of time set forth in the relevant statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following example illustrates the principle set forth in this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0">Example. In June of 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) enters into an installment agreement with the taxpayer to provide for periodic payments of the taxpayer's timely assessed tax liabilities. At the time the installment agreement is entered into, the taxpayer and the IRS execute a written agreement to extend the period of limitations on collection. The extension agreement executed in connection with the installment agreement operates to extend the period of limitations on collection to the date agreed upon in the extension agreement, plus 89 days. Subsequently, and prior to the expiration of the extended period of limitations on collection, the taxpayer files a bankruptcy petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and receives a discharge from bankruptcy a few months later. Assuming the tax is not discharged in the bankruptcy, section 6503(h) of the Internal Revenue Code operates to suspend the running of the previously extended period of limitations on collection for the period of time the IRS is prohibited from collecting due to the bankruptcy proceeding, and for 6 months thereafter. The new expiration date for the IRS to collect the tax is the date agreed upon in the previously executed extension agreement, plus 89 days, plus the period during which the IRS is prohibited from collecting due to the bankruptcy proceeding, plus 6 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Date when levy is considered made. The date on which a levy on property or rights to property is considered made is the date on which the notice of seizure required under section 6335(a) is given.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date.

Sec. 301.6503(a)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation;issuance of statutory notice of deficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. (1) Upon the mailing of a notice of deficiency for income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax under the provisions of section 6212, the period of limitation on assessment

and collection of any deficiency is suspended for 90 days after the mailing of a notice of such deficiency if the notice of deficiency is addressed to a person within the States of the Union and the District of Columbia, or 150 days if such notice of deficiency is addressed to a person outside the States of the Union and the District of Columbia (not counting Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the 90th or 150th day), plus an additional 60 days thereafter in either case. If a proceeding in respect of the deficiency is placed on the docket of the Tax Court, the period of limitation is suspended until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final, and for an additional 60 days thereafter. If a notice of deficiency is mailed to a taxpayer within the period of limitation and the taxpayer does not appeal therefrom to the Tax Court, the notice of deficiency so given does not suspend the running of the period of limitation with respect to any additional deficiency shown to be due in a subsequent deficiency notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon the mailing of a notice of deficiency for income, estate, gift, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 tax under the provisions of section 6212, the period of limitation on assessment

If a proceeding in respect of the deficiency is placed on the docket of the Tax Court, the period of limitation is suspended until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final, and for an additional 60 days thereafter. If a notice of deficiency is mailed to a taxpayer within the period of limitation and the taxpayer does not appeal therefrom to the Tax Court, the notice of deficiency so given does not suspend the running of the period of limitation with respect to any additional deficiency shown to be due in a subsequent deficiency notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A taxpayer filed a return for the calendar year 1973 on April 15, 1974; the notice of deficiency was mailed to him (at an address within the United States) on April 15, 1977; and he filed a petition with the Tax Court on July 14, 1977. The decision of the Tax Court became final on November 6, 1978. The running of the period of limitation for assessment is suspended from April 15, 1977, to January 5, 1979, which date is 60 days after the date (November 6, 1978), on which the decision became final. If in this example the taxpayer had failed to file a petition with the Tax Court, the running of the period of limitation for assessment would then be suspended from April 15, 1977 (the date of notice), to September 12, 1977 (that is, for the 90-day period in which he could file a petition with the Tax Court, and for 60 days thereafter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For provisions relating to suspension of the running of the period of limitation with respect to collection of ``second tier'' excise taxes (as defined in section 4963) until final resolution of a refund proceeding described in sections 4961 and 7422 for the determination of the taxpayer's liability for the second tier taxes, see Sec. 53.4961-2 (e)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Corporations joining in consolidated return. If a notice under section 6212(a) with respect to a deficiency in tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code for any taxable year is mailed to a corporation, the suspension of the running of the period of limitation provided in section 6503(a)(1) shall apply in the case of corporations with which such corporation made a consolidated income tax return for such taxable year. Under Sec. 1.1502-77(a) of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), relating to consolidated returns, notices of deficiency are mailed only to the common parent.

Sec. 301.6503(b)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation; assets of taxpayer in control or custody of court.</p><p class="depth0">Where all or substantially all of the assets of a taxpayer are in the control or custody of the court in any proceeding before any court of the United States, or of any State of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, the period of limitations on collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 is suspended with respect to the outstanding amount due on the assessment for the period such assets are in the control or custody of the court, and for 6 months thereafter. In the case of an estate of a decedent or an incompetent, the period of limitations on collection is suspended only for periods beginning after November 2, 1966, during which assets are in the control or custody of a court, and for 6 months thereafter.

Sec. 301.6503(c)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation;location of property outside the United States or removal of propertyfrom the United States; taxpayer outside of United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Property located outside, or removed from, the United States prior to November 3, 1966. The running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 is suspended for the period of time, prior to November 3, 1966, that collection is

hindered or delayed because property of the taxpayer is situated or held outside the United States or is removed from the United States. The total suspension of time under this provision shall not in the aggregate exceed 6 years. In any case in which the district director determines that collection is so hindered or delayed, he shall make and retain in the files of his office a written report which shall identify the taxpayer and the tax liability, shall show what steps were taken to collect the tax liability, shall state the grounds for his determination that property of the taxpayer is situated or held outside, or is removed from, the United States, and shall show the date on which it was first determined that collection was so hindered or delayed. The term ``property'' includes all property or rights to property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, belonging to the taxpayer. The suspension of the running of the period of limitations on collection shall be considered to begin on the date so determined by the district director. A copy of the report shall be mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see Sec. 301.6212-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxpayer outside United States after November 2, 1966. The running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment) is suspended for the period after November 2, 1966, during which the taxpayer is absent from the United States if such period is a continuous period of absence from the United States extending for 6 months or more. In a case where the running of the period of limitations has been suspended under the first sentence of this paragraph and at the time of the taxpayer's return to the United States the period of limitations would expire before the expiration of 6 months from the date of his return, the period of limitations shall not expire until after 6 months from the date of the taxpayer's return. The taxpayer will be deemed to be absent from the United States for purposes of this section if he is generally and substantially absent from the United States, even though he makes casual temporary visits during the period.

Sec. 301.6503(d)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation;extension of time for payment of estate tax.</p><p class="depth0">Where an estate is granted an extension of time as provided in section 6161 (a)(2) or (b)(2), or under the provisions of section 6166, for payment of any estate tax, the running of the period of limitations for collection of such tax is suspended for the period of time for which the extension is granted.


Sec. 301.6503(e)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation; certain powers of appointment.</p><p class="depth0">Where the estate of a decedent is allowed an estate tax charitable deduction under the provisions of section 2055(b)(2) (with respect to property over which the decedent's surviving spouse was given a power of appointment exercisable in favor of charitable organizations) subject to the later disallowance of the deduction if all conditions set forth in section 2055(b)(2) are not complied with, the running of the period of limitation for assessment or collection of any estate tax imposed on the decedent's estate is suspended until 30 days after the expiration of the period for assessment or collection of the estate tax imposed on the estate of the decedent's surviving spouse.


Sec. 301.6503(f)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitation;wrongful seizure of property of third-party owner and discharge oflien for substitution of  value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Wrongful seizure. The running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 (relating to collection after assessment) shall be suspended for a period equal to a period beginning on the date property (including money) is wrongfully seized or received by the appropriate official and ending on the date 30 days after the date on which the appropriate official returns the property pursuant to section 6343(b) (relating to authority to return property) or the date 30 days after the date on which a judgment secured pursuant to section 7426

(relating to civil actions by persons other than taxpayers) with respect to such property becomes final. The running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment shall be suspended under this section only with respect to the amount of such assessment which is equal to the amount of money or the value of specific property returned. This section applies in the case of property wrongfully seized or received after November 2, 1966. The following example illustrates the principles of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On June 1, 1968 (at which time 10 months remain before the period of limitations on collection after assessment will expire), the appropriate official wrongfully seizes $1,000 in B's account in Bank X and properly seizes $500 in taxpayer A's account in Bank Y in an attempt to satisfy A's assessed tax liability of $1,500. The appropriate official determines that the $1,000 seized in Bank X was not the property of taxpayer A and, on March 1, 1969, he returns the $1,000 to B. As a result of the wrongful seizure, the running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment of the amount owed by taxpayer A is suspended for the 9-month period (beginning June 1, 1968, when the money was wrongfully seized and ending March 1, 1969, when the money was returned to B), plus 30 days. Therefore, the period of limitations on collection after assessment prescribed in section 6502 will not expire until February 1, 1970, which is 10 months plus 30 days after the money was returned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Discharge of wrongful lien for substitution of value. If a person other than the taxpayer submits a request in writing for a certificate of discharge for a filed Federal tax lien under section 6325(b)(4), the running of the period of limitations on collection after assessment under section 6502 for any liability listed in such notice of Federal tax lien shall be suspended for a period equal to the period beginning on the date the appropriate official receives a deposit or bond in the amount specified in Sec. 301.6325-1(b)(4)(i) and ending on the date that is 30 days after the earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date the appropriate official no longer holds, or is deemed to no longer hold, within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, any amount as a deposit or bond by reason of taking such actions as prescribed in sections 6325(b)(4)(B) and (C); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date the judgment secured under section 7426(b)(5) becomes final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> As used in this section, the term appropriate official means either the official or office identified in the relevant IRS Publication or, if such official or office is not so identified, the Secretary or his delegate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to any request for a certificate of discharge made after January 31, 2008.

Sec. 301.6503(j)-1  Suspension of running of period of limitations;extension in case of designated and related summonses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The running of the applicable period of limitations on assessment provided for in section 6501 is suspended with respect to any return of tax by a corporation that is the subject of a designated or related summons if a court proceeding is instituted with respect to that summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Period of suspension. The period of suspension is the time during which the running of the applicable period of limitations on assessment provided for in section 6501 is suspended under section 6503(j). If a court requires any compliance with a designated or related summons by ordering that any record, document, paper, object, or items be produced, or the testimony of any person be given, the period of suspension consists of the judicial enforcement period plus 120 days. If a court does not require any compliance with a

designated or related summons, the period of suspension consists of the judicial enforcement period, and the period of limitations on assessment provided in section 6501 shall not expire before the 60th day after the close of the judicial enforcement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions--(1) A designated summons is a summons issued to a corporation (or to any other person to whom the corporation has transferred records) with respect to any return of tax by such corporation for a taxable period for which such corporation is being examined under the coordinated industry case program or any other successor to the coordinated examination program if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A designated summons is a summons issued to a corporation (or to any other person to whom the corporation has transferred records) with respect to any return of tax by such corporation for a taxable period for which such corporation is being examined under the coordinated industry case program or any other successor to the coordinated examination program if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Division Commissioner and the Division Counsel of the Office of Chief Counsel (or their successors) for the organizations that have jurisdiction over the corporation whose tax liability is the subject of the summons have reviewed the summons before it is issued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues the summons at least 60 days before the day the period prescribed in section 6501 for the assessment of tax expires (determined with regard to extensions); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The summons states that it is a designated summons for purposes of section 6503(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A related summons is any summons issued that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Relates to the same return of the corporation under examination as the designated summons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is issued to any person, including the person to whom the designated summons was issued, during the 30-day period that begins on the day the designated summons is issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The judicial enforcement period is the period that begins on the day on which a court proceeding is instituted with respect to a designated or related summons and ends on the day on which there is a final resolution as to the summoned person's response to that summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Court proceeding--(i) In general. For purposes of this section, a court proceeding is a proceeding filed in a United States district court either to quash a designated or related summons under section 7609(b)(2) or to enforce a designated or related summons under section 7604. A court proceeding includes any collateral proceeding, such as a civil contempt proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section, a court proceeding is a proceeding filed in a United States district court either to quash a designated or related summons under section 7609(b)(2) or to enforce a designated or related summons under section 7604. A court proceeding includes any collateral proceeding, such as a civil contempt proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date when proceeding is no longer pending. A proceeding to quash or to enforce a designated or related summons is no longer pending when all appeals (including review by the Supreme Court) are disposed of or after the expiration of the period in which an appeal may be taken or a request for further review (including review by the Supreme Court) may be made. If, however, following an enforcement order, a collateral proceeding is brought challenging whether the testimony given or production made by the summoned party fully satisfied the court order and whether sanctions should be imposed against the summoned party for a failure to so testify or produce, the proceeding to quash or to enforce the summons shall include the time from which the proceeding to quash or to enforce the summons was brought until the decision in the collateral proceeding becomes final. The decision becomes final on the date when all appeals (including review by the Supreme Court) are disposed of or when all appeal periods or all periods for further review (including review by the Supreme Court) expire. A decision in a collateral proceeding becomes final when all appeals (including review by the Supreme Court) are disposed of or when all appeal periods or all periods for further review (including review by the Supreme Court) expire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Compliance--(i) In general.

Compliance is the giving of testimony or the performance of an act or acts of production, or both, in response to a court order concerning the designated or related summons and the determination that the terms of the court order have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date compliance occurs. Compliance with a court order that wholly denies enforcement of a designated or related summons is deemed to occur on the date when all appeals (including review by the Supreme Court) are disposed of or when the period in which an appeal may be taken or a request for further review (including review by the Supreme Court) may be made expires. Compliance with a court order that

grants enforcement, in whole or in part, of a designated or related summons, occurs on the date the IRS determines that the testimony given, or the books, papers, records, or other data produced, or both, by the summoned party fully satisfy the court order concerning the summons. The IRS will determine whether there has been full compliance within a reasonable time, given the volume and complexity of the records produced, after the later of the giving of all testimony or the production of all records requested by the summons or required by any order enforcing any part of the summons. If, following an enforcement order, collateral proceedings are brought challenging whether the production made by the summoned party fully satisfied the court order and whether sanctions should be imposed against the summoned party for a failing to do so, the suspension of the periods of limitations shall continue until the order enforcing any part of the summons is fully complied with and the decision in the collateral proceeding becomes final. A decision in a collateral proceeding becomes final when all appeals are disposed of, the period in which an appeal may be taken has expired or the period in which a request for further review may be made has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Final resolution occurs when the designated or related summons or any order enforcing any part of the designated or related summons is fully complied with and all appeals or requests for further review are disposed of, the period in which an appeal may be taken has expired or the period in which a request for further review may be made has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules--(1) Number of summonses that may be issued--(i) Designated summons. Only one designated summons may be issued in connection with the examination of a specific taxable year or other period of a corporation. A designated summons may cover more than one year or other period of a corporation. The designated summons may require production of information that was previously sought in a summons (other than a designated summons) issued in the course of the examination of that particular corporation if that information was not previously produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Number of summonses that may be issued--(i) Designated summons. Only one designated summons may be issued in connection with the examination of a specific taxable year or other period of a corporation.

The designated summons may require production of information that was previously sought in a summons (other than a designated summons) issued in the course of the examination of that particular corporation if that information was not previously produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Related summonses. There is no restriction on the number of related summonses that may be issued in connection with the examination of a corporation. As provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, however, a related summons must be issued within the 30-day period that begins on the date on which the designated summons to which it relates is issued and must relate to the same return as the designated summons. A related summons may request the same information as the designated summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time within which court proceedings must be brought. In order for the period of limitations on assessment to be suspended under section 6503(j), a court proceeding to enforce or to quash a designated or related summons must be instituted within the period of limitations on assessment provided in section 6501 that is otherwise applicable to the tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation of suspension period if multiple court proceedings are instituted. If multiple court proceedings are instituted to enforce or to quash a designated or one or more related summonses concerning the same tax return, the period of limitations on assessment is suspended beginning on the date the first court proceeding is brought. The suspension shall end on the date that is the latest date on which the judicial enforcement period, plus the 120 day or 60 day period (depending on whether the court requires any compliance) as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, expires with respect to each summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect on other suspension periods--(i) In general. Suspensions of the period of limitations under section 6501 provided for under subsections 7609(e)(1) and (e)(2) do not apply to any summons that is issued pursuant to section 6503(j). The suspension under section 6503(j) of the running of the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501 is independent of, and may run concurrent with, any other suspension of the period of limitations on assessment that applies to the tax return to which the designated or related summons relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The period of limitations on assessment against Corporation P, a calendar year taxpayer, for its 2007 return is scheduled to end on March 17, 2011. (Ordinarily, Corporation P's returns are filed on March 15th of the following year, but March 15, 2008, was a Saturday, and Corporation P timely filed its return on the subsequent Monday, March 17, 2008, making March 17, 2011 the last day of the period of limitations on assessment for Corporation P's 2007 tax year.) On January 4, 2011, a designated summons is issued to Corporation P concerning its 2007 return. On March 3, 2011 (14 days before the period of limitations on assessment would otherwise expire with respect to Corporation P's 2007 return), a court proceeding is brought to enforce the designated summons issued to Corporation P. On June 6, 2011, the court orders Corporation P to comply with the designated summons. Corporation P does not appeal the court's order. On September 6, 2011, agents for Corporation P deliver material that they state are the records requested by the designated summons. On October 13, 2011, a final resolution to Corporation P's response to the designated summons occurs when it is determined that Corporation P has fully complied with the court's order. The suspension period applicable with respect to the designated summons issued to Corporation P consists of the judicial enforcement period (March 3, 2011, through October 13, 2011) and an additional 120-day period under section 6503(j)(1)(B), because the court required Corporation P to comply with the designated summons. Thus, the suspension period applicable with respect to the designated summons issued to Corporation P begins on March 3, 2011, and ends on February 10, 2012. Under the facts of this Example 1, the period of limitations on assessment against Corporation P further extends to February 24, 2012, to account for the additional 14 days that remained on the period of limitations on assessment under section 6501 when the suspension period under section 6503(j) began.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts set forth in Example 1, except that in addition to the issuance of the designated summons and related enforcement proceedings, on April 5, 2011, a summons concerning Corporation P's 2007 return is issued and served on individual A, a third party. This summons is not a related summons because it was not issued during the 30-day period that began on the date the designated summons was issued. The third-party summons served on individual A is subject to the notice requirements of section 7609(a). Final resolution of individual A's response to this summons does not occur until February 15, 2012. Because there is no final resolution of individual A's response to this summons by October 5, 2011, which is six months from the date of service of the summons, the period of limitations on assessment against Corporation P is suspended under section 7609(e)(2) to the date on which there is a final resolution to that response for the purposes of section 7609(e)(2). Moreover, because final resolution to the summons served on individual A does not occur until after February 10, 2012, the end of the suspension period for the designated summons, the period of limitations on assessment against Corporation P expires 14 days after the date that the final resolution as provided for in section 7609(e)(2) occurs with respect to the summons served on individual A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Computation of 60-day period when last day of assessment period falls on a weekend or holiday. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, in determining whether a designated summons has been issued at least 60 days before the date on which the period of limitations on assessment prescribed in section 6501 expires, the provisions of section 7503 apply when the last day of the assessment period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable on July 31, 2009.

Thus, if (i) an individual has a net operating loss for a taxable year subsequent to a taxable year for which he had chosen the benefits of income averaging, and (ii) such net operating loss carryback is wholly utilized in any one or more of his base period years (which would result in an increased amount of averageable income for such computation year), the special period of limitation with respect to such individual's computation year applies and a timely claim for credit or refund with respect to the computation year may be filed.

(1) If the claim for credit or refund related to an overpayment of income tax attributable to a work incentive program (WIN) credit carryback, provided in section 50A, then in lieu of the 3-year period from the time the return was filed in which the claim may be filed or credit or refund allowed, as prescribed in section 6511 (a) or (b), the period shall be whichever of the following 2 periods expires later:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the claim for credit or refund related to an overpayment of income tax attributable to a work incentive program (WIN) credit carryback, provided in section 50A, then in lieu of the 3-year period from the time the return was filed in which the claim may be filed or credit or refund allowed, as prescribed in section 6511 (a) or (b), the period shall be whichever of the following 2 periods expires later:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The period which ends with the expiration of the fifteenth day of the fortieth month (or thirty--ninth month, in the case of a corporation) following the end of the taxable year of the unused WIN credit which resulted in the carryback (or, with respect to any portion of a WIN credit carryback from a taxable year attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, the period which ends with the expiration of the fifteenth day of the fortieth month (or thirty-ninth month in the case of a corporation) following the end of such subsequent taxable year); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The period which ends with the expiration of the period prescribed in section 6511(c) within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed with respect to the taxable year of the unused WIN credit which resulted in the carryback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a claim for credit or refund involving a WIN credit carryback described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the amount of the credit or refund may exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 (b)(2) or (c), whichever is applicable, to the extent of the amount of the overpayment attributable to the carryback. If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on a WIN credit carryback described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but based also on other items, the credit or refund cannot exceed the sum of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the overpayment which is attributable to the WIN credit carryback, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The balance of such overpayment up to a limit of the portion, if any, of the tax paid within the period provided in section 6511 (b)(2) or (c), or within the period provided in any other applicable provision of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the claim involves an overpayment based not only on a WIN credit carryback described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but based also on other items, and if the claim with respect to any items is barred by the expiration of any applicable period of limitation, the portion of the overpayment attributable to the items not so barred shall be determined by treating the allowance of such items as the first adjustment to be made in computing such overpayment. If a claim for credit or refund is not filed, and if credit or refund is not allowed, within the period prescribed in this paragraph, then credit or refund may be allowed or made only if claim therefor is filed, or if such credit or refund is allowed, within the period prescribed in section 6511 (a), (b), or (c), whichever is applicable, subject to the provisions thereof limiting the amount of credit or refund in the case of a claim filed, or if no claim was filed, in case of credit or refund allowed, within such applicable period. For the limitations on the allowance of interest for an overpayment where credit or refund is subject to the provisions of this section, see section 6611(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Barred overpayments. If the allowance of a credit or refund of an overpayment of tax attributable to a WIN

credit carryback is otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 7122, relating to compromises), such credit or refund may be allowed or made under the provisions of section 6511(d)(7)(B) if a claim therefor is filed within the period provided by section 6511(d)(7)(A) and paragraph (a) of this section for filing a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback. In the case of a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to a carryback, the determination of any court, including the Tax Court, in any proceeding in which the decision of the courts has become final, shall not be conclusive with respect to the WIN credit, and the effect of such credit, to the extent that such credit is affected by a carryback which was not in issue in such proceeding.

Sec. 301.6511(f)-1  Special rules for chapter 42 taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax imposed by chapter 42 shall be filed by the taxpayer within 3 years from the time a return was filed by the private foundation or trust (as the case may be) with respect to such tax, or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expire the later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1972, D, an individual taxpayer who was a disqualified person under the provisions of section 4946(a)(1), participated in an act of self-dealing with a private foundation and incurred a tax under section 4941(a)(1). The private foundation files a Form 990-PF on May 15, 1973, and discloses thereon that it has engaged in an act of self-dealing with D. D files a Form 4720 on July 2, 1973, and pays the amount of tax imposed by section 4941(a) with respect to such act of self-dealing. For purposes of this section, the return was filed on May 15, 1973, and any claim for credit or refund by D must be filed by May 17, 1976 (May 15, 1976, was a Saturday).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that D filed a Form 4720 on July 1, 1974, and pays the tax on that date. D must then file any claim for credit or refund by July 1, 1976.

Sec. 301.6511(g)-1  Special rule for partnership items of federallyregistered partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. In the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A with respect to any person, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered partnership shall not expire before the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date which is 4 years after the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the partnership return for the partnership taxable year in which the item arose, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the taxpayer or a general partner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the partnership, as provided in Sec. 301.6501(o)-2(d), consents to extend the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to the partnership item before the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the date 6 months after the expiration of the extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limits on amount of credit or refund not applicable. In the case of a claim for credit or refund of any income tax overpayment attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered partnership, the limitations provided in section 6511(b) (2) and (c) shall not apply if the claim is filed within the period described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special periods of limitation with respect to carryback of net operating loss, capital loss, etc. The provisions of section 6511(g) must also be taken into account in applying the various special periods of limitation prescribed in section 6511(d). Thus, to the extent that a carryback is attributable to a partnership item of a federally registered partnership, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to that carryback shall not expire before the date determined under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the partnership taxable year in which the item arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms ``partnership item'' and ``federally registered partnership'' have the same meaning as such terms have when used in section 6501(o), Sec. 301.6501(o)-2(c), and Sec. 301.6501(o)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective generally for partnership items arising in partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978 and before September 4, 1982. This section shall not apply, however, to any partnership taxable year with respect to which the amendments made to Code section 6511(g) by section 402 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 are effective. See section 407(a)(3) of that Act.
