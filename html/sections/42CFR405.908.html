                            <p class="depth0">When a beneficiary is enrolled to receive benefits under both  Medicare and Medicaid, the Medicaid State agency may file a request for  an appeal with respect to a claim for items or services furnished to a  dually eligible beneficiary only for services for which the Medicaid  State agency has made payment, or for which it may be liable. A Medicaid  State agency is considered a party only when it files a timely  redetermination request with respect to a claim for items or services  furnished to a beneficiary in accordance with 42 CFR parts 940 through  958. If a State agency files a request for redetermination, it may  retain party status at the QIC, ALJ, MAC, and judicial review levels.</p>
