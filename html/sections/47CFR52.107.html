                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As used in this section, hoarding is the acquisition by a toll  free subscriber from a Responsible Organization of more toll free  numbers than the toll free subscriber intends to use for the provision  of toll free service. The definition of hoarding also includes number  brokering, which is the selling of a toll free number by a private  entity for a fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Toll free subscribers shall not hoard toll free numbers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No person or entity shall acquire a toll free number for the  purpose of selling the toll free number to another entity or to a person  for a fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Routing multiple toll free numbers to a single toll free  subscriber will create a rebuttable presumption that the toll free  subscriber is hoarding or brokering toll free numbers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tariff Provision. The following provision shall be included in  the Service Management System tariff and in the local exchange carriers'  toll free database access tariffs:</p><p class="depth2">[T]he Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') has concluded that  hoarding, defined as the acquisition of more toll free numbers than one  intends to use for the provision of toll free service, as well as the  sale of a toll free number by a private entity for a fee, is contrary to  the public interest in the conservation of the scarce toll free number  resource and contrary to the FCC's responsibility to promote the orderly  use and allocation of toll free numbers.</p>
