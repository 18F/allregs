                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? This section phases out the  operation of woodwaste burners (commonly known as wigwam or teepee  burners), and in the interim, limits the visible emissions from  woodwaste burners within the Indian reservation to control emissions of  particulate matter to the atmosphere and ground-level concentrations of  particulate matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Who is affected by this section? This section applies to any  person who owns or operates a woodwaste burner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section, the owner or operator of a  woodwaste burner must shut down and dismantle the woodwaste burner by no  later than two years after the effective date of this section. The  requirement for dismantling applies to all woodwaste burners regardless  of whether or not the woodwaste burners are currently operational. Until  the woodwaste burner is shut down, visible emissions from the woodwaste  burner must not exceed 20% opacity, averaged over any consecutive six- minute period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Until the woodwaste burner is shut down, only wood waste  generated on-site may be burned or disposed of in the woodwaste burner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If there is no reasonably available alternative method of  disposal for the wood waste other than by burning it on-site in a  woodwaste burner, the owner or operator of the woodwaste burner that is  in compliance with the opacity limit in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, may apply to the Regional Administrator for an extension of the  two-year deadline. If the Regional Administrator finds that there is no  reasonably available alternative method of disposal, then a two-year  extension of the deadline may be granted. There is no limit to the  number of extensions that may be granted by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What is the reference method for determining compliance with the  opacity limit? (1) The reference method for determining compliance with  the opacity limit is EPA Method 9. A complete description of this method  is found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Are there additional requirements that must be met? A person  subject to this section must submit a plan to shut down and dismantle  the woodwaste burner to the Regional Administrator within 180 days after  the effective date of this section. Unless an extension has been granted  by the Regional Administrator, the woodwaste burner must be shut down  and dismantled within two years after the effective date of this  section. The owner or operator of the woodwaste burner must notify the  Regional Administrator that the woodwaste burner has been shut down and  dismantled within 30 days after completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definitions of terms used in this section. The following terms  that are used in this section are defined in Sec. 49.123 General  provisions: Air pollutant, ambient air, emission, opacity, owner or   operator, particulate matter, PM10, PM2.5, reference method, Regional  Administrator, stationary source, uncombined water, visible emissions,  wood, and woodwaste burner.</p>
