                                Sec. 115.417  What portion of funds in a minor's supervised account
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Trust money in a minor's supervised account will not be distributed without a review of other resources that may be available to meet the needs of the minor. Any trust funds of a minor that are distributed must be used for the direct benefit of the minor and in accordance with any additional limitations (e.g., statutory, court order, tribal resolution, etc.) placed on the use of specific trust funds. Allowable uses may include health, education, or welfare when based upon a justified unmet need. The BIA will require receipts for expenditures of funds disbursed from a minor's account to a custodial parent, legal guardian, person who has been recognized by the BIA as having control and custody of the minor, or an emancipated minor.</p>
