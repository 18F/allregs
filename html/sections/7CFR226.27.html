What are the criteria for alternate protein products used in the</p><p class="depth0">Child and Adult Care Food Program?</p><p class="depth0">1. An alternate protein product used in meals planned under the provisions in Sec. 226.20 must meet all of the criteria in this section.</p><p class="depth0">2. An alternate protein product whether used alone or in combination with meat or meat alternate must meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0">a. The alternate protein product must be processed so that some portion of the non-protein constituents of the food is removed. These alternate protein products must be safe and suitable edible products produced from plant or animal sources.</p><p class="depth0">b. The biological quality of the protein in the alternate protein product must be at least 80 percent that of casein, determined by performing a Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS).</p><p class="depth0">c. The alternate protein product must contain at least 18 percent protein by weight when fully hydrated or formulated. (``When hydrated or formulated'' refers to a dry alternate protein product and the amount of water, fat, oil, colors, flavors or any other substances which have been added).</p><p class="depth0">d. Manufacturers supplying an alternate protein product to participating schools or institutions must provide documentation that the product meets the criteria in paragraphs A.2. through c of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">e. Manufacturers should provide information on the percent protein contained in the dry alternate protein product and on an as prepared basis.</p><p class="depth0">f. For an alternate protein product mix, manufacturers should provide information on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount by weight of dry alternate protein product in the package;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hydration instructions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Instructions on how to combine the mix with meat or other meat alternates.</p><p class="depth0">B. How are alternate protein products used in the Child and Adult Care</p><p class="depth0">Food Program?</p><p class="depth0">1. Schools, institutions, and service institutions may use alternate protein products to fulfill all or part of the meat/meat alternate component discussed in Sec. 226.20.</p><p class="depth0">2. The following terms and conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0">a. The alternate protein product may be used alone or in combination with other food ingredients. Examples of combination items are beef patties, beef crumbles, pizza topping, meat loaf, meat sauce, taco filling, burritos, and tuna salad.</p><p class="depth0">b. Alternate protein products may be used in the dry form (nonhydrated), partially hydrated or fully hydrated form. The moisture content of the fully hydrated alternate protein product (if prepared from a dry concentrated form) must be such that the mixture will have a minimum of 18 percent protein by weight or equivalent amount for the dry or partially hydrated form (based on the level that would be provided if the product were fully hydrated).</p><p class="depth0">C. How are commercially prepared products used in the Child and Adult Care Food Program?</p><p class="depth0">Schools, institutions, and service institutions may use a commercially prepared meat or meat alternate product combined with alternate protein products or use a commercially prepared product that contains only alternate protein products.
[65 FR 12442, Mar. 9, 2000]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 226 [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 226--Child Nutrition (CN) Labeling Program</p><p class="depth0">1. The Child Nutrition (CN) Labeling Program is a voluntary technical assistance program administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in conjunction with the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and National Marine Fisheries Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC) for the Child Nutrition Programs.

This program essentially involves the review of a manufacturer's recipe or product formulation to determine the contribution a serving of a commercially prepared product makes toward meal pattern requirements and a review of the CN label statement to ensure its accuracy. CN labeled products must be produced in accordance with all requirements set forth in this rule.</p><p class="depth0">2. Products eligible for CN labels are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Commercially prepared food products that contribute significantly to the meat/meat alternate component of meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR 210.10, 225.21, and 226.20 and are served in the main dish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Juice drinks and juice drink products that contain a minimum of 50 percent full-strength juice by volume.</p><p class="depth0">3. For the purpose of this appendix the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> CN label is a food product label that contains a CN label statement and CN logo as defined in paragraph 3 (b) and (c) below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The CN logo (as shown below) is a distinct border which is used around the edges of a ``CN label statement'' as defined in paragraph 3(c).[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC17SE91.009</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The CN label statement includes the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The product identification number (assigned by FNS),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The statement of the product's contribution toward meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR 210.10, 220.8, 225.21, and 226.20. The statement shall identify the contribution of a specific portion of a meat/meat alternate product toward the meat/meat alternate, bread/bread alternate, and/or vegetable/fruit component of the meal pattern requirements. For juice drinks and juice drink products the statement shall identify their contribution toward the vegetable/fruit component of the meal pattern requirements,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Statement specifying that the use of the CN logo and CN statement was authorized by FNS, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The approval date.</p><p class="depth0">For example:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC17SE91.010</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Federal inspection means inspection of food products by FSIS, AMS or USDC.</p><p class="depth0">4. Food processors or manufacturers may use the CN label statement and CN logo as defined in paragraph 3 (b) and (c) under the following terms and conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The CN label must be reviewed and approved at the national level by the Food and Nutrition Service and appropriate USDA or USDC Federal agency responsible for the inspection of the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The CN labeled product must be produced under Federal inspection by USDA or USDC. The Federal inspection must be performed in accordance with an approved partial or total quality control program or standards established by the appropriate Federal inspection service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The CN label statement must be printed as an integral part of the product label along with the product name, ingredient listing,

the inspection shield or mark for the appropriate inspection program, the establishment number where appropriate, and the manufacturer's or distributor's name and address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The inspection marking for CN labeled non-meat, non-poultry, and non-seafood products with the exception of juice drinks and juice drink products is established as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC17SE91.011</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Yields for determining the product's contribution toward meal pattern requirements must be calculated using the Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs (Program Aid Number 1331).</p><p class="depth0">5. In the event a company uses the CN logo and CN label statement inappropriately, the company will be directed to discontinue the use of the logo and statement and the matter will be referred to the appropriate agency for action to be taken against the company.</p><p class="depth0">6. Products that bear a CN label statement as set forth in paragraph 3(c) carry a warranty. This means that if a food service authority participating in the child nutrition programs purchases a CN labeled product and uses it in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, the school or institution will not have an audit claim filed against it for the CN labeled product for noncompliance with the meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR 210.10, 220.8, 225.21, and 226.20. If a State or Federal auditor finds that a product that is CN labeled does not actually meet the meal pattern requirements claimed on the label, the auditor will report this finding to FNS. FNS will prepare a report of the findings and send it to the appropriate divisions of FSIS and AMS of the USDA, National Marine Fisheries Services of the USDC, Food and Drug Administration, or the Department of Justice for action against the company.</p><p class="depth0">Any or all of the following courses of action may be taken:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The company's CN label may be revoked for a specific period of time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The appropriate agency may pursue a misbranding or mislabeling action against the company producing the product;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The company's name will be circulated to regional FNS offices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> FNS will require the food service program involved to notify the State agency of the labeling violation.</p><p class="depth0">7. FNS is authorized to issue operational policies, procedures, and instructions for the CN Labeling Program.</p><p class="depth0">To apply for a CN label and to obtain additional information on CN label application procedures write to: CN Labels, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, Nutrition and Technical Services Division, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22302.
