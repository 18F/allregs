The form the State submits to apply for a grant under a fire management assistance declaration.</p><p class="depth0">Declared fire. An uncontrolled fire or fire complex, threatening such destruction as would constitute a major disaster, which the Administrator has approved in response to a State's request for a fire management assistance declaration and in accordance with the criteria listed in Sec. 204.21.</p><p class="depth0">Demobilization. The process and procedures for deactivating, disassembling, and transporting back to their point of origin all resources that had been provided to respond to and support a declared fire.</p><p class="depth0">Fire complex.

This does not include Alaska Native corporations, the ownership of which is vested in private individuals.</p><p class="depth0">Individual assistance. Supplementary Federal assistance provided under the Stafford Act to individuals and families adversely affected by a major disaster or an emergency. Such assistance may be provided directly by the Federal Government or through State or local governments or disaster relief organizations.

The form which identifies actual costs incurred by eligible applicants as a result of the eligible firefighting activities.</p><p class="depth0">Public assistance. Supplementary Federal assistance provided under the Stafford Act to State and local governments or certain private, nonprofit organizations for eligible emergency measures and repair, restoration, and replacement of damaged facilities. For further information, see Subparts G and H of Part 206.</p><p class="depth0">Regional Administrator. The administrator of a regional office of FEMA, or his/her designated representative.</p><p class="depth0">Subgrant.
