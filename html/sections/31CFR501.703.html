                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The administrative process for enforcing TWEA sanctions programs  proceeds as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will notify  a suspected violator (hereinafter ``respondent'') of an alleged  violation by issuing a ``Prepenalty Notice.'' The Prepenalty Notice  shall describe the alleged violation(s) and include a proposed civil  penalty amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The respondent will have 60 days from the date the Prepenalty  Notice is served to make a written presentation either defending against  the alleged violation or admitting the violation. A respondent who  admits a violation may offer information as to why a monetary penalty  should not be imposed or why, if imposed, the monetary penalty should be  in a lesser amount than proposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Absent a settlement agreement or a finding that no violation  occurred, the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control will  issue a ``Penalty Notice.'' The respondent will have 30 days from the  date of service to either pay the penalty or request a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the respondent requests a hearing, the Director of the Office  of Foreign Assets Control will have two options:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Director may issue an ``Order Instituting Proceedings'' and  refer the matter to an Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and  decision; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Director may determine to discontinue the penalty action  based on information presented by the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Absent review by a Secretary's designee, the decision of the  Administrative Law Judge will become the final decision of the  Department without further proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If review is taken by a Secretary's designee, the Secretary's  designee reaches the final decision of the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A respondent may seek judicial review of the final decision of  the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construction of rules. The rules contained in this subpart shall  be construed and administered to promote the just, speedy, and  inexpensive determination of every action. To the extent there is a  conflict between the rules contained in this subpart and a procedural  requirement contained in any statute, the requirement in the statute  shall control.</p>
