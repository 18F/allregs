Therefore, a check from a minor's supervised account will not be forwarded to an address left with the United States post office. The new address of record must be provided directly to BIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a forwarding address has been provided to the United States post office, the United States post office will forward a statement of performance and general correspondence regarding a minor's supervised account that is mailed to the minor's address of record for a limited time period. However, it is the responsibility of a custodial parent, legal guardian, or emancipated minor to give BIA the new address of record for the minor's supervised account.</p>
