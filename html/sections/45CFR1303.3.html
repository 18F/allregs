                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All parties to proceedings under this part, including informal proceedings, have the right to be represented by an attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attorney fees may be charged to the program grant in an amount equal to the usual and customary fees charged in the locality. However, such fees may not exceed $250.00 per day, adjusted annually to reflect the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) beginning one year after the effective date of these regulations. The grantee or delegate agency may use current operating funds to pay these costs. The fees of only one attorney may be charged to the program grant with respect to a particular dispute. Such fees may not be charged if the grantee or delegate agency has an attorney on its staff, or if it has a retainer agreement with an attorney which fully covers fees connected with litigation. The grantee or delegate agency shall have the burden of establishing the usual and customary fees and shall furnish documentation to support that determination that is satisfactory to the responsible HHS official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A grantee or delegate agency may designate up to two persons to attend and participate in proceedings held under this Part. Travel and per diem costs of such persons, and of an attorney representing the grantee or delegate agency, shall not exceed those allowable under Standard Governmental Travel Regulations in effect at the time of the travel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event that use of program funds under this section would result in curtailment of program operations or inability to liquidate prior obligations, the party so affected may apply to the responsible HHS official for payment of these expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The responsible HHS official, upon being satisfied that these expenditures would result in curtailment of program operations or inability to liquidate prior obligations, must make payment therefor to the affected party by way of reimbursement from currently available funds.</p>
