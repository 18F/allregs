The ACC, the Agreement and the Contract will provide that, in the event of failure of the Agency to comply with the Agreement or Contract with the owner, the owner will have the right, if he/she is not in default, to demand that HUD investigate.

The ACC will provide that, if the Agency fails to comply with any of its obligations, HUD may determine that there is a substantial default and require the Agency to assign to HUD all of its rights and interests under the Contract; however, HUD will continue to pay annual contributions in accordance with the terms of the ACC and the Contract. Before determining that an Agency is in substantial default, HUD will give the Agency a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rights of Agency and HUD if Owner defaults under Contract.
