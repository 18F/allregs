Approval of a State program and promulgation of a Federal program are described in the paragraphs below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under section 503 of the Act and 30 CFR parts 730, 731 and 732 a State in which there are coal exploration activities or surface mining and reclamation operations must submit a State program to the Secretary for approval if it wishes to assume exclusive regulatory jurisdiction on non-Federal and non-Indian lands within its borders. The State programs must meet the requirements of the Act and 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pursuant to section 504 of SMCRA and 30 CFR 736.11, OSM must promulgate and implement a Federal program in each State in which the Director reasonably expects coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations to exist on non-Federal and non-Indian lands at any time before June, 1985, and either: (1) The State does not submit a State program, (2) the Secretary of the Interior finally disapproves the program submitted by the State, or (3) the Secretary of the Interior withdraws approval of the State program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Under section 405 of SMCRA and 30 CFR part 884, each State having within its borders coal mined lands eligible for reclamation under Title IV of SMCRA, may submit to the Secretary a State Reclamation Plan, demonstrating its capability for administering an abandoned mine reclamation program. Title IV provides that the Secretary may approve the plan once the State has an approved regulatory program under Title V of SMCRA. If the Secretary determines that a State has developed and submitted a program for reclamation and has the necessary State legislation to implement the provisions of Title IV, the Secretary shall grant the State exclusive responsibility and authority to implement the provisions of the approved plan. Section 405 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1235) contains the requirements for State reclamation plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> States with approved programs may enter into cooperative agreements with OSM in order to become the regulatory authority for coal mining on Federal lands, in accordance with 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter D.</p>
