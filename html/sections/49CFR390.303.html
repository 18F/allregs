When an event occurs while passengers are on a passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle (e.g., a crash, the vehicle is disabled, the driver is ill) that requires a motor carrier immediately to obtain a replacement vehicle from another motor carrier, the two carriers may postpone the writing of the lease or written agreement for the replacement vehicle for up to 48 hours after the time the lessee takes exclusive possession and control of the replacement vehicle. The driver of the vehicle must carry for the duration of the lease, and upon demand of an enforcement official produce, a document signed and dated by the lessee's driver or available company official stating: ``[Carrier A, USDOT number, telephone number] has leased this vehicle to [Carrier B, USDOT number, telephone number] pursuant to 49 CFR 390.303(a)(2).''

The time and date when, and the location where, the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement begins and ends. These times and locations shall coincide with the times for the providing of receipts required by paragraph (e) of this section, unless the parties wish to end the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement prematurely; in that case, the receipt required by paragraph (e) of this section showing the date, time of day, and location where the lessor recovers possession of the passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle shall supersede the date, time of day, and location for termination specified by the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exclusive possession and responsibilities.

A clear specification of the legal obligation of the lessee to maintain insurance coverage for the vehicle being operated for the protection of the public pursuant to 49 CFR part 387. The lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement shall further specify who is responsible for providing any other insurance coverage for the operation of the leased, interchanged, or otherwise procured equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Copies of the lease. A signed original and two copies of each lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement shall be produced. The lessee shall keep the original and, except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, shall place a copy of the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement on the passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle during the period of the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement.

The motor carrier lessee shall identify the commercial motor vehicle as being in its service as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the period of the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement, the lessee shall mark the passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 390.21(f) (Leased and interchanged passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicles).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise indicated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and in this paragraph, a copy of the lease, interchange agreement, or other agreement shall be carried on the passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of a master lease applicable to more than one vehicle that is carried on the passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicle meets the requirements of this paragraph provided it complies with all other requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In lieu of a copy of an interchange agreement, a written statement meets the requirements of this paragraph if it identifies the parties to the agreement by company name and
