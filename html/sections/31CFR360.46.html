                            <p class="depth0">The Department of the Treasury will treat the receipt by: A Federal  Reserve Bank or Branch, or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service of a bond  and an acceptable request for reissue as determining the date upon which  the rights of the parties are fixed for the purpose of reissue. For  example, if the owner or either coowner of a bond dies after the bond  has been surrendered for reissue, the bond will be regarded as having  been reissued in the decedent's lifetime.</p>
