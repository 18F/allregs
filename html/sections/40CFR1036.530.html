                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to calculate official emission results  for CO2, CH4, and N2O.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calculate brake-specific emission rates for each applicable duty  cycle as specified in 40 CFR 1065.650. Do not apply infrequent  regeneration adjustment factors to your results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> to obtain the official emission results. You are not  required to apply this adjustment for fuels containing at least 75  percent pure alcohol, such as E85. The purpose of this adjustment is to  make official emission results independent of differences in test fuels  within a fuel type. Use good engineering judgment to develop and apply  testing protocols to minimize the impact of variations in test fuels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For liquid fuels, determine the net energy content (Btu per  pound of fuel) according to ASTM D4809 or ASTM D240 (both incorporated  by reference in Sec.  1036.810) and carbon weight fraction  (dimensionless) of your test fuel according to ASTM D5291 (incorporated  by reference in Sec.  1036.810). (Note that we recommend using ASTM  D4809.) For gaseous fuels, use good engineering judgment to determine  the fuel's net energy content and carbon weight fraction. (Note: Net  energy content is also sometimes known as lower heating value.)  Calculate the test fuel's carbon-specific net energy content (Btu/lbC)  by dividing the net energy content by the carbon fraction, expressed to  at least five significant figures. You may perform these calculations  using SI units with the following conversion factors: one Btu equals  1055.06 Joules and one Btu/lb equals 0.0023260 MJ/kg.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you control test fuel properties so that variations in the  actual carbon-specific energy content are the same as or smaller than  the repeatability of measuring carbon-specific energy content, you may  use a constant value equal to the average carbon-specific energy content  of your test fuel. Otherwise, use the measured value for the specific  test fuel used for a given test. If you use a constant value, you must  update or verify the value at least once per year, or after changes in  test fuel suppliers or specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calculate the adjustment factor for carbon-specific net energy  content by dividing the carbon-specific net energy content of your test  fuel by the reference level in the following table, expressed to at  least five decimal places. Note that as used in this section, the unit  lbC means pound of carbon and kgC means kilogram of carbon.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Reference       Reference</p><p class="depth3">carbon-         carbon-</p><p class="depth3">Fuel type                  specific net    specific net</p><p class="depth3">energy content  energy content</p><p class="depth3"><em>(Btu/lbC)</em>       (MJ/kgC) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Diesel fuel.............................          21,200         49.3112 Gasoline................................          21,700         50.4742 Natural Gas.............................          28,500         66.2910 LPG.....................................          24,300         56.5218 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Your official emission result equals your calculated brake- specific emission rate multiplied by the adjustment factor specified in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For example, if the net energy content  and carbon fraction of your diesel test fuel are 18,400 Btu/lb and  0.870, the carbon-specific net energy content of the test fuel would be  21,149 Btu/lbC. The adjustment factor in the example above would be  0.99759 (21,149/21,200). If your brake-specific CO2 emission  rate was 630.0 g/hp-hr, your official emission result would be 628.5 g/ hp-hr.</p>
