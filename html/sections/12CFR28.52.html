                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of allocated transfer risk reserve. A banking  institution shall establish an allocated transfer risk reserve (ATRR)  for specified international assets when required by the OCC in  accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Procedures and standards--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Joint agency determination. At  least annually, the Federal banking agencies shall determine jointly,  based on the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section,  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Which international assets subject to transfer risk warrant  establishment of an ATRR;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the ATRR for the specified assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether an ATRR established for specified assets may be  reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Standards for requiring ATRR--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Evaluation of assets. The  Federal banking agencies shall apply the following criteria in  determining whether an ATRR is required for particular international  assets:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the quality of a banking institution's assets has been  impaired by a protracted inability of public or private obligors in a  foreign country to make payments on their external indebtedness as  indicated by such factors, among others, as whether:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such obligors have failed to make full interest payments on  external indebtedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such obligors have failed to comply with the terms of any  restructured indebtedness; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A foreign country has failed to comply with any International  Monetary Fund or other suitable adjustment program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether no definite prospects exist for the orderly restoration  of debt service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of amount of ATRR. (A) In determining the amount  of the ATRR, the Federal banking agencies shall consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The length of time the quality of the asset has been impaired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recent actions taken to restore debt service capability;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prospects for restored asset quality; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Such other factors as the Federal banking agencies may consider  relevant to the quality of the asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The initial year's provision for the ATRR shall be 10 percent of  the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such  greater or lesser percentage determined by the Federal banking agencies.  Additional provision, if any, for the ATRR in subsequent years shall be  15 percent of the principal amount of each specified international  asset, or such greater or lesser percentage determined by the Federal  banking agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notification. Based on the joint agency determinations under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the OCC shall notify each banking  institution holding assets subject to an ATRR:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Of the amount of the ATRR to be established by the institution  for specified international assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That an ATRR to be established for specified assets may be  reduced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Accounting treatment of ATRR--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Charge to current income. A  banking institution shall establish an ATRR by a charge to current  income and the amounts so charged shall not be included in the banking  institution's capital or surplus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Separate accounting. A banking institution shall account for an  ATRR separately from the Allowance for Possible Loan Losses, and shall  deduct the ATRR from ``gross loans and leases'' to arrive at ``net loans  and leases.'' The ATRR must be established for each asset subject to the  ATRR in the percentage amount specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consolidation. A banking institution shall establish an ATRR, as  required, on a consolidated basis. Consolidation should be in accordance  with the procedures and tests of significance set forth in the  instructions for preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and  Income (FFIEC 031, 032, 033 and 034). For bank holding companies, the  consolidation shall be in accordance with the principles set forth in  the ``Instructions to the Bank Holding Company Financial Supplement to  Report F.R. Y-6'' (Form F.R. Y-9). Edge corporations and Agreement  corporations engaged in banking shall report in accordance with  instructions for preparation of the Report of Condition for Edge  corporations and Agreement corporations (Form F.R. 2886b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Alternative accounting treatment. A banking institution need not  establish an ATRR if it writes down in the period in which the ATRR is  required, or has written down in prior periods, the value of the  specified international assets in the requisite amount for each such  asset. For purposes of this paragraph, international assets may be  written down by a charge to the Allowance for Possible Loan Losses or a  reduction in the principal amount of the asset by application of  interest payments or other collections on the asset. However, the  Allowance for Possible Loan Losses must be replenished in such amount  necessary to restore it to a level which adequately provides for the  estimated losses inherent in the banking institution's loan portfolio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reduction of ATRR. A banking institution may reduce an ATRR when  notified by the OCC or, at any time, by writing down such amount of the  international asset for which the ATRR was established.</p>
