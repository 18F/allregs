The approved yield may have yield adjustments elected under applicable policy provisions, or other limitations according to FCIC approved procedures applied when calculating the approved yield.</p><p class="depth0">Catastrophic risk protection. The minimum level of coverage offered by FCIC which is required before a person may qualify for certain other USDA program benefits unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop.

For the 1999 and subsequent crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC.</p><p class="depth0">Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.
