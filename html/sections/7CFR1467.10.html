Identified conservation practices or activities  may be implemented by the participant, NRCS, or other NRCS designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost-share payments may be made for replacement of an eligible  conservation practice, if NRCS determines that the practice is still  needed and that the failure of the original conservation practice was  due to reasons beyond the control of the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A participant may seek additional cost-share assistance from  other public or private organizations as long as the conservation  practices or activities funded are in compliance with this part.
