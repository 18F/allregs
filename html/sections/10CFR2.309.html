                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Any person whose interest may be affected  by a proceeding and who desires to participate as a party must file a  written request for hearing and a specification of the contentions which  the person seeks to have litigated in the hearing. In a proceeding under  10 CFR 52.103, the Commission, acting as the presiding officer, will  grant the request if it determines that the requestor has standing under  the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section and has proposed at  least one admissible contention that meets the requirements of paragraph  (f) of this section. For all other proceedings, except as provided in  paragraph (e) of this section, the Commission, presiding officer, or the  Atomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the request for  hearing and/or petition for leave to intervene, will grant the request/ petition if it determines that the requestor/petitioner has standing  under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section and has proposed  at least one admissible contention that meets the requirements of  paragraph (f) of this section. In ruling on the request for hearing/ petition to intervene submitted by petitioners seeking to intervene in  the proceeding on the HLW repository, the Commission, the presiding  officer, or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board shall also consider  any failure of the petitioner to participate as a potential party in the  pre-license application phase under subpart J of this part in addition  to the factors in paragraph (d) of this section. If a request for  hearing or petition to intervene is filed in response to any notice of  hearing or opportunity for hearing, the applicant/licensee shall be  deemed to be a party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing. Unless specified elsewhere in this chapter or otherwise  provided by the Commission, the request or petition and the list of  contentions must be filed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In proceedings for the direct or indirect transfer of control of  an NRC license when the transfer requires prior approval of the NRC  under the Commission's regulations, governing statute, or pursuant to a  license condition, twenty (20) days from the date of publication of the  notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In proceedings for the initial authorization to construct a  high-level   radioactive waste geologic repository, and the initial licensee to  receive and process high level radioactive waste at a geological  repository operations area, thirty (30) days from the date of  publication of the notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In proceedings for which a Federal Register notice of agency  action is published (other than a proceeding covered by paragraphs  (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section), not later than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time specified in any notice of hearing or notice of  proposed action or as provided by the presiding officer or the Atomic  Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the request and/or  petition, which may not be less than sixty (60) days from the date of  publication of the notice in the Federal Register; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If no period is specified, sixty (60) days from the date of  publication of the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In proceedings for which a Federal Register notice of agency  action is not published, not later than the latest of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sixty (60) days after publication of notice on the NRC Web site  at http://www.nrc.gov/public-involve/major-actions.html, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sixty (60) days after the requestor receives actual notice of a  pending application, but not more than sixty (60) days after agency  action on the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Filings after the deadline; submission of hearing request,  intervention petition, or motion for leave to file new or amended  contentions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination by presiding officer. Hearing requests,  intervention petitions, and motions for leave to file new or amended  contentions filed after the deadline in paragraph (b) of this section  will not be entertained absent a determination by the presiding officer  that a participant has demonstrated good cause by showing that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information upon which the filing is based was not  previously available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The information upon which the filing is based is materially  different from information previously available; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The filing has been submitted in a timely fashion based on the  availability of the subsequent information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicability of Sec. Sec. 2.307 and 2.323. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Section 2.307  applies to requests to change a filing deadline (requested before or  after that deadline has passed) based on reasons not related to the  substance of the filing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 2.323 does not apply to hearing requests, intervention  petitions, or motions for leave to file new or amended contentions filed  after the deadline in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New petitioner. A hearing request or intervention petition filed  after the deadline in paragraph (b) of this section must include a  specification of contentions if the petitioner seeks admission as a  party, and must also demonstrate that the petitioner meets the  applicable standing and contention admissibility requirements in  paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Party or participant. A new or amended contention filed by a  party or participant to the proceeding must also meet the applicable  contention admissibility requirements in paragraph (f) of this section.  If the party or participant has already satisfied the requirements for  standing under paragraph (d) of this section in the same proceeding in  which the new or amended contentions are filed, it does not need to do  so again.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. A request for hearing or  petition for leave to intervene must state:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address and telephone number of the requestor or  petitioner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the requestor's/petitioner's right under the Act  to be made a party to the proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nature and extent of the requestor's/petitioner's  property, financial or other interest in the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The possible effect of any decision or order that may be issued  in the proceeding on the requestor's/petitioner's interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rulings. In ruling on a request for hearing or petition for  leave to intervene, the Commission, the presiding officer, or the Atomic  Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on such requests must  determine, among other   things, whether the petitioner has an interest affected by the  proceeding considering the factors enumerated in paragraph (d)(1) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Standing in enforcement proceedings. In enforcement proceedings,  the licensee or other person against whom the action is taken shall have  standing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Discretionary Intervention. The presiding officer may consider a  request for discretionary intervention when at least one requestor/ petitioner has established standing and at least one admissible  contention has been admitted so that a hearing will be held. A  requestor/petitioner may request that his or her petition be granted as  a matter of discretion in the event that the petitioner is determined to  lack standing to intervene as a matter of right under paragraph (d)(1)  of this section. Accordingly, in addition to addressing the factors in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a petitioner who wishes to seek  intervention as a matter of discretion in the event it is determined  that standing as a matter of right is not demonstrated shall address the  following factors in his/her initial petition, which the Commission, the  presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will consider  and balance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Factors weighing in favor of allowing intervention--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which the requestor's/petitioner's participation  may reasonably be expected to assist in developing a sound record;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature and extent of the requestor's/petitioner's property,  financial or other interests in the proceeding; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The possible effect of any decision or order that may be  issued in the proceeding on the requestor's/petitioner's interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factors weighing against allowing intervention--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The availability of other means whereby the requestor's/ petitioner's interest will be protected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which the requestor's/petitioner's interest will  be represented by existing parties; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which the requestor's/petitioner's participation  will inappropriately broaden the issues or delay the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Contentions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for hearing or petition for leave to  intervene must set forth with particularity the contentions sought to be  raised. For each contention, the request or petition must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be  raised or controverted, provided further, that the issue of law or fact  to be raised in a request for hearing under 10 CFR 52.103(b) must be  directed at demonstrating that one or more of the acceptance criteria in  the combined license have not been, or will not be met, and that the  specific operational consequences of nonconformance would be contrary to  providing reasonable assurance of adequate protection of the public  health and safety;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide a brief explanation of the basis for the contention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Demonstrate that the issue raised in the contention is within  the scope of the proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Demonstrate that the issue raised in the contention is material  to the findings the NRC must make to support the action that is involved  in the proceeding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Provide a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert  opinions which support the requestor's/petitioner's position on the  issue and on which the petitioner intends to rely at hearing, together  with references to the specific sources and documents on which the  requestor/petitioner intends to rely to support its position on the  issue;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In a proceeding other than one under 10 CFR 52.103, provide  sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the  applicant/licensee on a material issue of law or fact. This information  must include references to specific portions of the application  (including the applicant's environmental report and safety report) that  the petitioner disputes and the supporting reasons for each dispute, or,  if the petitioner believes that the application fails to contain  information on a relevant matter as required by law, the identification  of each failure and the supporting reasons for the petitioner's belief;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> In a proceeding under 10 CFR 52.103(b), the information must  be sufficient, and include supporting information showing, prima facie,  that one or more of the acceptance criteria in the combined license have  not been, or will not be met, and that the specific operational  consequences of nonconformance would be contrary to providing reasonable  assurance of adequate protection of the public health and safety. This  information must include the specific portion of the report required by  10 CFR 52.99(c) which the requestor believes is inaccurate, incorrect,  and/or incomplete (i.e., fails to contain the necessary information  required by Sec. 52.99(c)). If the requestor identifies a specific  portion of the Sec. 52.99(c) report as incomplete and the requestor  contends that the incomplete portion prevents the requestor from making  the necessary prima facie showing, then the requestor must explain why  this deficiency prevents the requestor from making the prima facie  showing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contentions must be based on documents or other information  available at the time the petition is to be filed, such as the  application, supporting safety analysis report, environmental report or  other supporting document filed by an applicant or licensee, or  otherwise available to a petitioner. On issues arising under the  National Environmental Policy Act, participants shall file contentions  based on the applicant's environmental report. Participants may file new  or amended environmental contentions after the deadline in paragraph (b)  of this section (e.g., based on a draft or final NRC environmental  impact statement, environmental assessment, or any supplements to these  documents) if the contention complies with the requirements in paragraph  (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If two or more requestors/petitioners seek to co-sponsor a  contention, the requestors/petitioners shall jointly designate a  representative who shall have the authority to act for the requestors/ petitioners with respect to that contention. If a requestor/petitioner  seeks to adopt the contention of another sponsoring requestor/ petitioner, the requestor/petitioner who seeks to adopt the contention  must either agree that the sponsoring requestor/petitioner shall act as  the representative with respect to that contention, or jointly designate  with the sponsoring requestor/petitioner a representative who shall have  the authority to act for the requestors/petitioners with respect to that  contention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Selection of hearing procedures. A request for hearing and/or  petition for leave to intervene may, except in a proceeding under 10 CFR  52.103, also address the selection of hearing procedures, taking into  account the provisions of Sec. 2.310. If a request/petition relies upon  Sec. 2.310(d), the request/petition must demonstrate, by reference to  the contention and the bases provided and the specific procedures in  subpart G of this part, that resolution of the contention necessitates  resolution of material issues of fact which may be best determined  through the use of the identified procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Requirements applicable to States, local governmental bodies,  and Federally-recognized Indian Tribes seeking party status. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a  State, local governmental body (county, municipality or other  subdivision), or Federally-recognized Indian Tribe seeks to participate  as a party in a proceeding, it must submit a request for hearing or a  petition to intervene containing at least one admissible contention, and  must designate a single representative for the hearing. If a request for  hearing or petition to intervene is granted, the Commission, the  presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board ruling on the  request will admit as a party to the proceeding a single designated  representative of the State, a single designated representative for each  local governmental body (county, municipality or other subdivision), and  a single designated representative for each Federally-recognized Indian  Tribe. Where a State's constitution provides that both the Governor and  another State official or State governmental body may represent the  interests of the State in a proceeding, the Governor and the other State  official/government body will be considered separate participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the proceeding pertains to a production or utilization  facility (as defined in Sec. 50.2 of this chapter) located within the  boundaries of the State,   local governmental body, or Federally-recognized Indian Tribe seeking to  participate as a party, no further demonstration of standing is  required. If the production or utilization facility is not located  within the boundaries of the State, local governmental body, or  Federally-recognized Indian Tribe seeking to participate as a party, the  State, local governmental body, or Federally-recognized Indian Tribe  also must demonstrate standing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any proceeding on an application for a construction  authorization for a high-level radioactive waste repository at a  geologic repository operations area under parts 60 or 63 of this  chapter, or an application for a license to receive and possess high- level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area under  parts 60 or 63 of this chapter, the Commission shall permit intervention  by the State and local governmental body (county, municipality or other  subdivision) in which such an area is located and by any affected  Federally-recognized Indian Tribe as defined in parts 60 or 63 of this  chapter if the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section are  satisfied with respect to at least one contention. All other petitions  for intervention in any such proceeding must be reviewed under the  provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Answers to hearing requests, intervention petitions, and motions  for leave to file new or amended contentions filed after the deadline.  Unless otherwise specified by the Commission, the presiding officer, or  the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board designated to rule on the request,  petition, or motion--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant/licensee, the NRC staff, and other parties to a  proceeding may file an answer to a hearing request, intervention  petition, or motion for leave to file amended or new contentions filed  after the deadline in Sec. 2.309(b) within 25 days after service of the  request, petition, or motion. Answers should address, at a minimum, the  factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section insofar  as these sections apply to the filing that is the subject of the answer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except in a proceeding under Sec. 52.103 of this chapter, the  participant who filed the hearing request, intervention petition, or  motion for leave to file new or amended contentions after the deadline  may file a reply to any answer. The reply must be filed within 7 days  after service of that answer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No other written answers or replies will be entertained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Decision on request/petition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In all proceedings other than  a proceeding under Sec. 52.103 of this chapter, the presiding officer  shall issue a decision on each request for hearing or petition to  intervene within 45 days of the conclusion of the initial pre-hearing  conference or, if no pre-hearing conference is conducted, within 45 days  after the filing of answers and replies under paragraph (i) of this  section. With respect to a request to admit amended or new contentions,  the presiding officer shall issue a decision on each such request within  45 days of the conclusion of any pre-hearing conference that may be  conducted regarding the proposed amended or new contentions or, if no  pre-hearing conference is conducted, within 45 days after the filing of  answers and replies, if any. In the event the presiding officer cannot  issue a decision within 45 days, the presiding officer shall issue a  notice advising the Commission and the parties, and the notice shall  include the expected date of when the decision will issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission, acting as the presiding officer, shall  expeditiously grant or deny the request for hearing in a proceeding  under Sec. 52.103 of this chapter. The Commission's decision may not be  the subject of any appeal under Sec. 2.311.
