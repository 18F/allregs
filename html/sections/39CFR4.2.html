In the event of  the Vice Chairman's death, departure or resignation prior to the  election of a successor, the Board, as soon as practicable, shall elect  a new Vice Chairman who shall serve a term that commences immediately  upon election and expires upon the election and installation of a  successor Vice Chairman.
