                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Automatic authorization. If the project cost does not exceed the cost limitations provided in column 1 of Table I in Sec. 157.208(d), the certificate holder may acquire, construct, modify, replace, and operate facilities for the remediation and maintenance of an existing underground storage facility, provided the storage facility's certificated physical parameters--including total inventory, reservoir pressure, reservoir and buffer boundaries, and certificated capacity remain unchanged--and provided compliance with environmental and safety provisions is not affected. The certificate holder must not alter the function of any well that is drilled into or is active in the management of the storage facility. The certificate holder must not segment projects in order to meet this cost limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior Notice. Subject to the notice requirements of Sec. Sec. 157.205(b) and 157.208(c), the certificate holder is authorized to acquire, construct, modify, replace, and operate natural gas underground storage facilities, provided the storage facility's certificated physical parameters--including total inventory, reservoir pressure, reservoir and buffer boundaries, and certificated capacity remain unchanged--and provided compliance with environmental and safety provisions is not affected. The cost of a project may not exceed the cost limitation provided in column 2 of Table I in Sec. 157.208(d). the certificate holder must not segment projects in order to meet this cost limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of request. In addition to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 157.206(b) and 157.208(c), requests for activities authorized under paragraph (b) of this section must contain, to the extent necessary to demonstrate that the proposed project will not alter a storage reservoir's total inventory, reservoir pressure, reservoir or buffer boundaries, or certificated capacity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the current geological interpretation of the storage reservoir, including both the storage formation and the caprock, including summary analysis of any recent cross-sections, well logs, quantitative porosity and permeability data, and any

other relevant data for both the storage reservoir and caprock;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The latest isopach and structural maps of the storage field, showing the storage reservoir boundary, as defined by fluid contacts or natural geological barriers; the protective buffer boundary; the surface and bottomhole locations of the existing and proposed injection/withdrawal wells and observation wells; and the lengths of open-hole sections of existing and proposed injection/withdrawal wells;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Isobaric maps (data from the end of each injection and withdrawal cycle) for the last three injection/withdrawal seasons, which include all wells, both inside and outside the storage reservoir and within the buffer area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A detailed description of present storage operations and how they may change as a result of the new facilities or modifications. Include a detailed discussion of all existing operational problems for the storage field, including but not limited to gas migration and gas loss;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Current and proposed working gas volume, cushion gas volume, native gas volume, deliverability (at maximum and minimum pressure), maximum and minimum storage pressures, at the present certificated maximum capacity or pressure, with volumes and rates in MMcf and pressures in psia;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The latest field injection/withdrawal capability studies including curves at present and proposed working gas capacity, including average field back pressure curves and all other related data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The latest inventory verification study for the storage field, including methodology, data, and work papers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The shut-in reservoir pressures (average) and cumulative gas-in-place (including native gas) at the beginning of each injection and withdrawal season for the last 10 years; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A detailed analysis, including data and work papers, to support the need for additional facilities (wells, gathering lines, headers, compression, dehydration, or other appurtenant facilities) for the modification of working gas/cushion gas ratio and/or to improve the capability of the storage field.
