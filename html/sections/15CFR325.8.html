The Secretary and the Attorney General will  consider such requests in light of an applicant's showing that it has a  special need for a prompt decision. A request for expedited action  should include an explanation of why expedited action is needed,  including a   statement of all relevant facts and circumstances, such as bidding  deadlines or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant,  that require the applicant to act in less than ninety days and that have  a significant impact on the applicant's export trade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary shall advise the applicant within ten days after  the application is deemed submitted whether it will receive expedited  action. The Secretary may grant the request in whole or in part and  process the remainder of the application through the normal procedures.  Expedited action may be granted only if the Attorney General concurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time period. The Secretary shall determine whether to issue a  certificate to the applicant within forty-five days after the Secretary  granted the request for expedited action, or within a longer period if  agreed to by the applicant (excluding any suspension pursuant to Sec.  325.3(f) of the time period for making a determination). The Secretary  may not issue a certificate until thirty days after the summary of the  application is published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Concurrence of the Attorney General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not later than ten  working days before the date on which a determination on the application  is due, the Secretary shall deliver a proposed certificate to the  Attorney General for discussion and comment. If the Attorney General  does not agree that the proposed certificate may be issued, he shall,  not later than five working days before the date on which a  determination on the application is due, so advise the Secretary and  state the reasons for the disagreement. The Secretary, with the  concurrence of the Attorney General, may revise the proposed certificate  to resolve the objections and problems raised by the Attorney General,  or deny the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Attorney General receives the proposed certificate by the  date specified in the preceding paragraph and does not respond within  the time period specified in that paragraph, he shall be deemed to  concur in the proposed certificate.</p>
