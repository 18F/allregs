An excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner, or  practitioner transferred to disability inactive status must comply with  the provisions of this section and Sec.  11.60 to be reinstated. Failure  to comply with the provisions of this section may constitute both  grounds for denying reinstatement or readmission; and cause for further  action, including seeking further exclusion, suspension, and for  revocation of any pending probation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise ordered by the USPTO Director, any excluded,  suspended or resigned practitioner, or practitioner transferred to  disability inactive status shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Within thirty days after the date of entry of the order of  exclusion, suspension, acceptance of resignation, or transfer to  disability inactive status:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> File a notice of withdrawal as of the effective date of the  exclusion, suspension, acceptance of resignation, or transfer to  disability inactive status in each pending patent and trademark  application, each pending reexamination and interference or trial  proceeding, and every other matter pending in the Office, together with  a copy of the notices sent pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide notice to all State and Federal jurisdictions and  administrative agencies to which the practitioner is admitted to  practice and all clients the practitioner represents having immediate or  prospective business before the Office in patent, trademark and   other non-patent matters of the order of exclusion, suspension,  acceptance of resignation, or transferred to disability inactive status  and of the practitioner's consequent inability to act as a practitioner  after the effective date of the order; and that, if not represented by  another practitioner, the client should act promptly to substitute  another practitioner, or to seek legal advice elsewhere, calling  attention to any urgency arising from the circumstances of the case;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide notice to the practitioner(s) for all opposing parties  (or, to the parties in the absence of a practitioner representing the  parties) in matters pending before the Office of the practitioner's  exclusion, suspension, resignation, or transfer to disability inactive  status and, that as a consequence, the practitioner is disqualified from  acting as a practitioner regarding matters before the Office after the  effective date of the suspension, exclusion, resignation or transfer to  disability inactive status, and state in the notice the mailing address  of each client of the excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner, or  practitioner transferred to disability inactive status who is a party in  the pending matter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Deliver to all clients having immediate or prospective business  before the Office in patent, trademark or other non-patent matters any  papers or other property to which the clients are entitled, or shall  notify the clients and any co-practitioner of a suitable time and place  where the papers and other property may be obtained, calling attention  to any urgency for obtaining the papers or other property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Relinquish to the client, or other practitioner designated by  the client, all funds for practice before the Office, including any  legal fees paid in advance that have not been earned and any advanced  costs not expended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Take any necessary and appropriate steps to remove from any  telephone, legal, or other directory any advertisement, statement, or  representation which would reasonably suggest that the practitioner is  authorized to practice patent, trademark, or other non-patent law before  the Office; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Serve all notices required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and  (b)(1)(iii) of this section by certified mail, return receipt requested,  unless mailed abroad.

The OED Director may  require such additional proof as is deemed necessary. In addition, for  the period of discipline, an excluded or suspended practitioner, or a  practitioner transferred to disability inactive status shall continue to  file a statement in accordance with Sec.  11.11, regarding any change of  residence or other address to which communications may thereafter be  directed, so that the excluded or suspended practitioner, or  practitioner transferred to disability inactive status may be located if  a grievance is received regarding any conduct occurring before or after  the exclusion or suspension.

During  the thirty-day period of limited recognition, the excluded, suspended or  resigned practitioner, or practitioner transferred to disability  inactive status shall conclude work on behalf of a client on any matters  that were pending before the Office on the date of entry of the order of  exclusion or suspension, or acceptance of resignation. If such work  cannot be concluded, the excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner,  or practitioner transferred to disability inactive status shall so  advise the client so that the client may make other arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Required records. An excluded, suspended or resigned  practitioner, or practitioner transferred to disability inactive status  shall keep and maintain records of the various steps taken under this  section, so that in any subsequent proceeding proof of compliance with  this section and with the exclusion or suspension order will be  available. The OED Director will require the practitioner to submit such  proof as a condition precedent to the granting of any petition for  reinstatement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner, or practitioner  on disability inactive status who aids another practitioner in any way  in the other practitioner's practice of law before the Office, may,  under the direct supervision of the other practitioner, act as a  paralegal for the other practitioner or perform other services for the  other practitioner which are normally performed by laypersons, provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner, or  practitioner transferred to disability inactive status is a salaried  employee of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The other practitioner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The other practitioner's law firm; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A client-employer who employs the other practitioner as a  salaried employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The other practitioner assumes full professional responsibility  to any client and the Office for any work performed by the excluded,  suspended or resigned practitioner for the other practitioner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The excluded, suspended or resigned practitioner, or  practitioner transferred to disability inactive status does not:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Communicate directly in writing, orally, or otherwise with a  client of the other practitioner in regard to any immediate or  prospective business before the Office;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Render any legal advice or any legal services to a client of  the other practitioner in regard to any immediate or prospective  business before the Office; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Meet in person or in the presence of the other practitioner in  regard to any immediate or prospective business before the Office, with:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any Office employee in connection with the prosecution of any  patent, trademark, or other case;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any client of the other practitioner, the other practitioner's  law firm, or the client-employer of the other practitioner; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any witness or potential witness whom the other practitioner,  the other practitioner's law firm, or the other practitioner's client- employer may or intends to call as a witness in any proceeding before  the Office.
