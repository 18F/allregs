(1) The color additive FD&C; Red No. 40 is principally the disodium salt of 6-hydroxy-5-[(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive FD&C; Red No. 40 is principally the disodium salt of 6-hydroxy-5-[(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Color additive mixtures for food use (including dietary supplements) made with FD&C; Red No. 40 may contain only those diluents that are suitable and that are listed in part 73 of this chapter as safe for use in color additive mixtures for coloring foods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The listing of this color additive includes lakes prepared as described in Sec. 82.51 of this chapter, except that the color additive used is FD&C; Red No. 40 and the resultant lakes meet the specification and labeling requirements prescribed by Sec. 82.51 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. FD&C; Red No. 40 shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by good manufacturing practice:
Sum of volatile matter (at 135 [deg]C.) and chlorides and sulfates (calculated as sodium salts), not more than 14.0 percent.Water-insoluble matter, not more than 0.2 percent.Higher sulfonated subsidiary colors (as sodium salts), not more than 1.0 percent.Lower sulfonated subsidiary colors (as sodium salts), not more than 1.0 percent.Disodium salt of 6-hydroxy-5-[(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulfophenyl) azo] -8-(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulfophenoxy)-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, not more than 1.0 percent.Sodium salt of 6-hydroxy-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (Schaeffer's salt), not more than 0.3 percent.4-Amino-5-methoxy-o- toluenesulfonic acid, not more than 0.2 percent.Disodium salt of 6,6'-oxybis (2-naphthalene-sulfonic acid), not more than 1.0 percent.Lead (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million.Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million.Total color, not less than 85.0 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. FD&C; Red No. 40 may be safely used for coloring foods (including dietary supplements) generally in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice except that it may not be used to color foods for which standards of identity have been promulgated under section 401 of

the act unless added color is authorized by such standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling.
