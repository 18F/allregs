                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Corporations subject to restrictions and  limitations. If an election by an affiliated group under section  243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable year of the common  parent corporation, then each corporation (including the common parent  corporation) which is a member of such group on each day of its matching  taxable year shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations  prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section for such  taxable year. For purposes of this section, the term matching taxable  year shall mean the taxable year of each member (including the common  parent corporation) of an affiliated group which includes the last day  of a particular taxable year of the common parent corporation for which  an election by the affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is  effective. If a corporation is a member of an affiliated group on each  day of a short taxable year which does not include the last day of a  taxable year of the common parent corporation, and if an election under  section 243(b)(2) is effective for such short year, see paragraph (g) of  this section. In the case of taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending  in 1964 for which an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective under  paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of Sec. 1.243-4, see paragraph (f)(9) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Members filing consolidated returns. The restrictions and  limitations prescribed by this section shall apply notwithstanding the  fact that some of the corporations which are members of the electing  affiliated group (within the meaning of section 243(b)(5)) join in the  filing of a consolidated return. Thus, for example, if an electing  affiliated group includes one or more corporations taxable under section  11 of the Code and two or more insurance companies taxable under section  802 of the Code, and if the insurance companies join in the filing of a  consolidated return, the amount of such companies' exemptions from  estimated tax (for purposes of sections 6016 and 6655) shall be the  amounts determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section and not the  amounts determined pursuant to the regulations under section 1502.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(2)</em> is effective  with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then no  corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of  its matching taxable year may consent (or shall be deemed to consent) to  an election under section 1562(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, relating to election of multiple  surtax exemptions, which would be effective for such matching taxable  year. Thus, each corporation which is a component member of the  controlled group of corporations with respect to its matching taxable  year (determined by applying section 1563(b) without regard to paragraph  (2)(D) thereof) shall determine its surtax exemption for such taxable  year in accordance with section 1561 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(D)</em>  (relating to certain insurance companies treated as excluded members).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Throughout 1965 corporation M owns all the stock of  corporations L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2. M is a domestic mutual insurance  company subject to tax under section 821 of the Code, L-1 and L-2 are  domestic life insurance companies subject to tax under section 802 of  the Code, and S-1 and S-2 are domestic corporations subject to tax under  section 11 of the Code. Each corporation uses the calendar year as its  taxable year. M makes a valid election under section 243(b)(2) for the  affiliated group consisting of M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2. If part II,  subchapter B, chapter 6 of the Code were applied with respect to the  1965 taxable years of the corporations without regard to section  243(b)(6)(A), the following would result: S-1 and S-2 would be treated  as component members of a controlled group of corporations on such date;  L-1 and L-2 would be treated as component members of a separate  controlled group on such date; and M would be treated as an excluded  member. However, since section 243(b)(6)(A) requires that part II of  subchapter B be applied without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and  (b)(2)(D), for purposes of determining the surtax exemptions of M, L-1,  L-2, S-1, and S-2 for their 1965 taxable years, such corporations are  treated for purposes of such part II as component members of a single  controlled group of corporations on December 31, 1965. Moreover, by  reason of having made the election under section 243(b)(2), M, L-1, L-2,  S-1, and S-2 cannot consent to multiple surtax exemption elections under  section 1562 which would be effective for their 1965 taxable years.  Thus, such corporations are limited to a single $25,000 surtax exemption  for such taxable years (to be apportioned among such corporations in  accordance with section 1561 and the regulations thereunder).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Foreign tax credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. If an election by an affiliated  group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable  year of the common parent corporation, then:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The credit under section 901 for taxes paid or accrued to any  foreign country or possession of the United States shall be allowed to a  corporation which is a member of such affiliated group for each day of  its matching taxable year only if each other corporation which pays or  accrues such foreign taxes to any foreign country or possession, and  which is a member of such group on each day of its matching taxable  year, does not deduct such taxes in computing its tax liability for its  matching taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on  each day of its matching taxable year may use the overall limitation  provided in section 904(a)(2) for such matching taxable year only if  each other corporation which pays or accrues foreign taxes to any  foreign country or possession, and which is a member of such group on  each day of its matching taxable year,   uses such limitation for its matching taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consent of the Commissioner. In the absence of unusual  circumstances, a request by a corporation for the consent of the  Commissioner to the revocation of an election of the overall limitation,  or to a new election of the overall limitation, for the purpose of  satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph  will be given favorable consideration, notwithstanding the fact that  there has been no change in the basic nature of the corporation's  business or changes in conditions in a foreign country which  substantially affect the corporation's business. See paragraph (d)(3) of  Sec. 1.904-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other restrictions and limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If an  election by an affilated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with  respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then, except  to the extent that an apportionment plan adopted under paragraph (f) of  this section for such taxable year provides otherwise with respect to a  restriction or limitation described in this paragraph, the rules  provided in subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph shall  apply to each corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on  each day of its matching taxable year for the purpose of computing the  amount of such restriction or limitation for its matching taxable year.  For purposes of this paragraph, each corporation which is a member of an  electing affiliated group (including any member which joins in filing a  consolidated return) shall be treated as a separate corporation for  purposes of determining the amount of such restrictions and limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accumulated earnings credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Except as provided in  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, in determining the minimum  accumulated earnings credit under section 535(c)(2) (or the accumulated  earnings credit of a mere holding or investment company under section  535(c)(3) for each corporation which is a member of the affiliated group  on each day of its matching taxable year, in lieu of the $150,000 amount  ($100,000 amount in the case of taxable years beginning before January  1, 1975) mentioned in such sections there shall be substituted an amount  equal to (a) $150,000 ($100,000 in the case of taxable years beginning  before January 1, 1975), divided by (b) the number of such members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of excess. If, with respect to one or more members,  the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph exceeds  the sum of (a) such member's accumulated earnings and profits as of the  close of the preceding taxable year, plus (b) such member's earnings and  profits for the taxable year which are retained (within the meaning of  section 535(c)(1), then any such excess shall be subtracted from the  amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and shall  be divided equally among those remaining members of the affiliated group  that do not have such an excess (until no such excess remains to be  divided among those remaining members that have not had such an excess).  The excess so divided among such remaining members shall be added to the  amount determined under subdivision (i) with respect to such members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Apportionment plan not allowed. An affiliated group may not  adopt an apportionment plan, as provided in paragraph (f) of this  section, with respect to the amounts computed under the provisions of  this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated  by the following example;</p><p class="depth0">Example. An affiliated group is composed of four member  corporations, W, X, Y, and Z. The sum of the accumulated earnings and  profits (as of the close of the preceding taxable year ending December  31, 1975) plus the earnings and profits for the taxable year ending  December 31, 1976 which are retained is $15,000, $75,000, $37,500, and  $300,000 in the case of W, X, Y, and Z, respectively. The amounts  determined under this subparagraph for W, X, Y, and Z are $15,000,  $48,750, $37,500 and $48,750, respectively, computed as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Component members</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>...........................       37,500       37,500       37,500       37,500</p><p class="depth0">Excess......................................................       22,500            0            0            0 Allocation of excess........................................  ...........        7,500        7,500        7,500 New excess..................................................  ...........  ...........        7,500  ...........

For  purposes of making the computations under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of  this subparagraph, a corporation which joins in the filing of a  consolidated return shall be treated as if it filed a separate return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Estimate of exploration expenditures. If, on the date a  corporation (which is a member of an affiliated group on each day of its  matching taxable year) files its income tax return for such taxable  year, it cannot be determined whether or not the $100,000 limitation  prescribed by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, or the $400,000  limitation prescribed by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, will  apply with respect to such taxable year, then such member shall, for  purposes of such return, apply the provisions of such subdivisions (i)  and (ii) with respect to such taxable year on the basis of an estimate  of the aggregate of the exploration expenditures by all such members of  the affiliated group for their matching taxable years. Such estimate  shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances known at the  time of such estimate. If an estimate is used by any such member of the  affiliated group pursuant to this subdivision, and if the actual  expenditures by all such members differ from the estimate, then each  such member shall file as soon as possible an original or amended return  reflecting an amended apportionment (either pursuant to an apportionment  plan adopted under paragraph (f) of this section or pursuant to the  application of the rule provided by subdivision (i) or (ii) of this  subparagraph) based upon such actual expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Amount apportioned under apportionment plan. If an electing  affiliated group adopts an apportionment plan as   provided in paragraph (f) of this section with respect to the limitation  under section 615(a) or 615(c), then the amount apportioned under such  plan to any corporation which is a member of such group may not exceed  the amount which such member could have deducted (or deferred) under  section 615 had such affiliated group not filed an election under  section 243(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> and  809(d)(10) shall not exceed an amount equal to $25,000 divided by the  number of life insurance companies taxable under section 802 which are  members of such group on each day of their matching taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Estimated tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exemption from estimated tax. Except as  otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the  exemption from estimated tax (for purposes of estimated tax filing  requirements under section 6016 and the addition to tax under section  6655 for failure to pay estimated tax) of each corporation which is a  member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year  shall be (in lieu of the $100,000 amount specified in section 6016(a)  and (b)(2)(A) and in section 6655(d)(1) and (e)(2)(A) an amount equal to  $100,000 divided by the number of such members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nonapplication to certain taxable years beginning in 1963 and  ending in 1964. For purposes of this section, if a corporation has a  taxable year beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964 the last day of the  eighth month of which falls on or before April 10, 1964, then  (notwithstanding the fact that an election under section 243(b)(2) is  effective for such taxable year) subdivision (i) of this subparagraph  shall not apply to such corporation for such taxable year. Thus, such  corporation shall be entitled to a $100,000 exemption from estimated tax  for such taxable year. Also, with respect to a taxable year described in  the first sentence of this subdivision, any such corporation shall not  be considered to be a member of the affiliated group for purposes of  determining the number of members referred to in subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The provisions of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation P owns all the stock of corporation S-1 on  each day of 1965. On March 1, 1965, P acquires all the stock of  corporation S-2. Corporations P, S-1, and S-2 file separate returns on a  calendar year basis. On March 31, 1965, the affiliated group consisting  of P, S-1, and S-2 anticipates making an election under section  243(b)(2) for P's 1965 taxable year. If the affiliated group does make a  valid election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year, under  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph the exemption from estimated tax of  P for 1965, and the exemption from estimated tax of S-1 for 1965, will  be (assuming an apportionment plan is not filed pursuant to paragraph  (f) of this section) an amount equal to $50,000 ($100,000/2). (Since S-2  is not a member of the affiliated group on each day of 1965, S-2's  exemption from estimated tax will be determined for the year 1965  without regard to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, whether or not  the affiliated group makes the election under section 243(b)(2).) P and  S-1 file declarations of estimated tax on April 15, 1965, on such basis  and make payments with respect to such declarations on such basis. Thus,  if the affiliated group does make a valid election under section  243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year, P and S-1 will not incur (as a result of  the application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to their 1965  years) additions to tax under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated  tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that, on  March 31, 1965, S-1 anticipates that it will incur a loss for its 1965  year. Accordingly, in anticipation of making an election under section  243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year and adopting an apportionment plan under  paragraph (f) of this section, P computes its estimated tax liability  for 1965 on the basis of a $100,000 exemption, and S-1 computes its  estimated tax liability for 1965 on the basis of a zero exemption.  Assume S-1 incurs a loss for 1965 as anticipated. Thus, if P does make  the election for 1965, and an apportionment plan is adopted apportioning  $100,000 to P and zero to S-1 (for their 1965 years), P and S-1 will not  incur (as a result of the application of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph to their 1965 years) additions to tax under section 6655  for failure to pay estimated tax.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that P and  S-1 file declarations of estimated tax on April 15, 1965, on the basis  of separate $100,000 exemptions   from estimated tax for their 1965 years, and make payments with respect  to such declarations on such basis. Assume that the affiliated group  makes an election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year. Under  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, P and S-1 are limited in the  aggregate to a single $100,000 exemption from estimated tax for their  1965 years. The provisions of section 6655 will be applied to the 1965  year of P and the 1965 year of S-1 on the basis of a $50,000 exemption  from estimated tax for each corporation, unless a different  apportionment of the $100,000 amount is adopted under paragraph (f) of  this section. Since the election was made under section 243(b)(2),  regardless of whether or not the affiliated group anticipated making the  election, P or S-1 (or both) may incur additions to tax under section  6655 for failure to pay estimated tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effect of election for certain taxable years beginning in 1963  and ending in 1964. If an election under section 243(b)(2) by an  affiliated group is effective for a taxable year of a corporation under  paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of Sec. 1.243-4 (relating to election for certain  taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964), and if such  corporation is a member of such group on each day of such taxable year,  then the restrictions and limitations prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c),  and (d) of this section shall apply to all such members having such  taxable years (for such taxable years). For purposes of this paragraph,  such paragraphs shall be applied with respect to such taxable years as  if such taxable years included the last day of a taxable year of the  common parent corporation for which an election was effective under  section 243(b)(2), i.e., as if such taxable years were matching taxable  years. For apportionment plans with respect to such taxable years, see  paragraph (f) (9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Apportionment plans--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In the case of corporations  which are members of an affiliated group of corporations on each day of  their matching taxable years:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this  section (relating to limitation under section 615(a)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> of this  section (relating to limitation under section 615(c)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The $25,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(4) of this  section (relating to small business deduction of life insurance  companies), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this subparagraph, but in no  event shall the sum of the amounts so apportioned in respect to any such  subdivision exceed the amount referred to in such subdivision. See also  paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section, relating to the maximum amount that  may be apportioned to a corporation under this subparagraph with respect  to exploration expenditures to which section 615 applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time for adopting plan. An affiliated group may adopt an  apportionment plan with respect to the matching taxable years of its  members only if, at the time such plan is sought to be adopted, there is  at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any  extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against any  corporation the tax liability of which for any taxable year would be  increased by the adoption of such plan. (If there is less than 1 year  remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for  the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of  business or principal office or agency of the corporation will  ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such  statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Years for which effective. A valid apportionment plan with  respect to matching taxable years of members of an affiliated group  shall be effective for such matching taxable years, and for all  succeeding matching taxable years of such members, unless the plan is   amended in accordance with subparagraph (8) of this paragraph or is  terminated. Thus, the apportionment plan (including any amendments  thereof) has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually. An  apportionment plan with respect to a particular taxable year of the  common parent shall terminate with respect to the taxable years of the  members of the affiliated group which include the last day of a  succeeding taxable year of the common parent if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any corporation which was a member of the affiliated group on  each day of its matching taxable year which included the last day of the  particular taxable year of the common parent is not a member of such  group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last day of  such succeeding taxable year of the common parent, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, (d)(4), and (d)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Filing of plan. The apportionment plan shall be in the form of a  statement filed by the common parent corporation with the district  director for the internal revenue district in which is located the  principal place of business or principal office or agency of such common  parent. The statement shall be signed by any person who is duly  authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation and shall  set forth the name, address, internal revenue district, taxpayer account  number, and taxable year of each member to whom the common parent could  apportion an amount under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (or, in the  case of an apportionment plan referred to in subparagraph (9) of this  paragraph, each member to whom the common parent could apportion an  amount under such subparagraph) and the amount (or amounts) apportioned  to each such member under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consent of wholly owned subsidiaries. If all the stock of a  corporation which is a member of the affiliated group on each day of its  matching taxable year is owned on each such day by another corporation  (or corporations) which is a member of such group on each day of its  matching taxable year, such corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph  referred to as a ``wholly owned subsidiary'') shall be deemed to consent  to the apportionment plan. Each wholly owned subsidiary should attach a  copy of the plan filed by the common parent corporation to an income tax  return, amended return, or claim for refund for its matching taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Consent of other members. The consent of each member (other than  the common parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries) to an  apportionment plan shall be in the form of a statement, signed by any  person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the member consenting  to the plan, stating that such member consents to the plan. The consent  of more than one such member may be incorporated in a single statement.  The statement (or statements) shall be attached to the apportionment  plan filed by the common parent corporation. The consent of any such  member which, after the date the apportionment plan was filed and during  its matching taxable year referred to in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary but continues to be a  member, shall be filled with the district director with whom the  apportionment plan is filed (as soon as possible after it ceases to be a  wholly owned subsidiary). Each consenting member should attach a copy of  the apportionment plan filed by the common parent to an income tax  return, amended return, or claim for refund for its matching taxable  year   which includes the last day of the taxable year of the common parent  corporation for which the apportionment plan was filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Members of group filing consolidated return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.
