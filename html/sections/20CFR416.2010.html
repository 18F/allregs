                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payments. Any agreement between SSA and a State made pursuant to Sec. 416.2005 must provide that, if for optional supplementation, such State supplementary payments are made to all individuals and/or couples who are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Receiving (or at the option of the State would, but for the amount of their income, be eligible to receive) supplemental security income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within the variations and categories (as defined in Sec. 416.2030) for which the State (or political subdivision) wishes to provide a supplementary payment, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Residing, subject to the provisions of Sec. 416.2035(a), in such State (or political subdivision thereof).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative costs. (1) SSA shall assess each State that had elected Federal administration of optional and/or mandatory State supplementary payments an administration fee for administering those payments. The administration fee is assessed and paid monthly and is derived by multiplying the number of State supplementary payments made by SSA on behalf of a State for any month in a fiscal year by the applicable dollar rate for the fiscal year. The number of supplementary payments made by SSA in a month is the total number of checks issued, and direct deposits made, to recipients in that month, that are composed in whole or in part of State supplementary funds. The dollar rates are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SSA shall assess each State that had elected Federal administration of optional and/or mandatory State supplementary payments an administration fee for administering those payments. The administration fee is assessed and paid monthly and is derived by multiplying the number of State supplementary payments made by SSA on behalf of a State for any month in a fiscal year by the applicable dollar rate for the fiscal year. The number of supplementary payments made by SSA in a month is the total number of checks issued, and direct deposits made, to recipients in that month, that are composed in whole or in part of State supplementary funds. The dollar rates are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For fiscal year 1994, $1.67;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For fiscal year 1995, $3.33;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For fiscal year 1996, $5.00;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For fiscal year 1997, $5.00;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For fiscal year 1998, $6.20;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For fiscal year 1999, $7.60;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> For fiscal year 2000, $7.80;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> For fiscal year 2001, $8.10;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> For fiscal year 2002, $8.50; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> For fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The applicable rate in the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year of the increase exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the increase, and rounded to the nearest whole cent; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such different rate as the Commissioner determines is appropriate for the State taking into account the complexity of administering the State's supplementary payment program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SSA shall charge a State an additional services fee if, at the request of the State, SSA agrees to provide the State with additional services beyond the level customarily provided in the administration of State supplementary payments. The additional services fee shall be in an amount that SSA determines is necessary to cover all costs, including indirect costs, incurred by the Federal Government in furnishing the additional services. SSA is not required to perform any additional services requested by a State and may, at its sole discretion, refuse to perform those additional services. An additional services fee charged a State may be a one-time charge or, if the furnished services result in ongoing costs to the Federal Government, a monthly or less frequent charge to the State for providing such services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agreement period. The agreement period for a State which has elected Federal administration of its supplementary payments will extend for one year from the date the agreement was signed unless otherwise designated. The agreement will be automatically renewed for a period of one year unless either the State or SSA gives written notice not to renew, at least 90 days before the beginning of the new period. For a State to elect Federal administration, it must notify SSA of its intent to enter into an agreement, furnishing the necessary payment specifications, at least 120 days before the first day of the month for which it wishes Federal administration to begin, and have executed such agreement at least 30 days before such day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modification or termination. The agreement may be modified at any time by mutual consent. The State or SSA may terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice to the other party, provided the effective date of the termination is the last day of a quarter. However, the State may terminate the agreement upon 45 days written notice to SSA where: (1) The State does not wish to comply with a regulation promulgated by SSA subsequent to the execution of the agreement; and (2) the State provides such written notice within 30 days of the effective date of the regulation. The Secretary is not precluded from terminating the agreement in less than 90 days where he finds that a State has failed to materially comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section or Sec. 416.2090.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mandatory minimum State supplementation. Any administration agreement between SSA and a State under which SSA will make such State's mandatory minimum State supplementary payments shall provide that the State will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certify income and payment amount. Certify to SSA the names of each individual who, for December 1973 was eligible for and a recipient of aid or assistance in the form of money payments under a plan of such State approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI of the Act (Sec. 416.121), together with the amount of such aid or assistance payable to each such individual and the amount of such individual's other income (as defined in Sec. 416.2050(b)(2)), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional data. Provide SSA with such additional data at such times as SSA may reasonably require in order to properly, economically, and efficiently carry out such administration agreement. This shall include required information on changes in countable income as well as changes in special

needs and circumstances that would result in a decrease in the mandatory income level being maintained by the State, unless the State has specified in the agreement that the minimum income level shall not be lowered by such changes.
