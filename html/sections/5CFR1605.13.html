                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Participant not employed. The following rules apply to participants who receive a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment for a period during which the participant was separated from Government service or was not appointed to a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the participant is reinstated or retroactively appointed to a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized, immediately upon reinstatement or retroactive appointment the employing agency must give the participant the opportunity to submit a contribution election to make current contributions. The contribution election will be effective as soon as administratively feasible, but no later than the first day of the first full pay period after it is received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employing agency must give a reinstated or retroactively appointed participant the following options for electing makeup contributions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reinstated or retroactively appointed participant may submit a new contribution election for purposes of makeup contributions if he or she

would have been eligible to make such an election but for the erroneous separation or erroneous failure to appoint; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a reinstated participant had a contribution election on file when he or she separated, the contribution election the participant had on file when he or she separated may be reinstated for purposes of makeup contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All contributions made under this paragraph (a) and associated breakage will be invested according to the participant's contribution allocation on the posting date. Breakage will be calculated using the G Fund share prices in accordance with Sec. 1605.2 unless otherwise required by the employing agency or the court or other tribunal with jurisdiction over the back pay case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participant employed. The following rules apply to participants who receive a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment for a period during which the participant was employed in a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participant will be entitled to make up contributions for the period covered by the back pay award or retroactive pay adjustment only if for that period--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The participant had designated a percentage of basic pay to be contributed to the TSP; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The participant had designated a dollar amount of contributions each pay period which equaled the applicable ceiling (FERS or CSRS) on contributions per pay period, and which, therefore, was limited as a result of the reduction in pay that is made up by the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employing agency must compute the amount of additional employee contributions, agency matching contributions, and agency automatic (1%) contributions that would have been contributed to the participant's account had the reduction in pay leading to the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment not occurred; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All contributions under this paragraph (b) and associated breakage will be posted to the participant's account based on the participant's contribution allocation on the posting date. Breakage will be calculated in accordance with Sec. 1605.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contributions to be deducted before payment or other retroactive pay adjustment. Employee makeup contributions required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be computed before the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment is paid, deducted from the back pay or other retroactive pay adjustment, and submitted to the TSP record keeper;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must not cause the participant to exceed the annual contribution limit(s) contained in sections 402(g) and 415(c) of the I.R.C. (26 U.S.C. 402(g) and 415(c)) for the year(s) with respect to which the contributions are being made, taking into consideration the TSP contributions already made in (or with respect to) that year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must be accompanied by attributable agency matching contributions. In any event, regardless of whether a participant elects to make up employee contributions, the employing agency must make all appropriate agency automatic (1%) contributions associated with the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prior withdrawal of TSP account. If a participant has withdrawn his or her TSP account other than by purchasing an annuity, and the separation from Government service upon which the withdrawal was based is reversed, resulting in reinstatement of the participant without a break in service, the participant will have the option to restore the amount withdrawn to his or her TSP account. The right to restore the withdrawn funds will expire if the participant does not notify the Board within 90 days of reinstatement. If the participant returns the funds that were withdrawn, the number of shares purchased will be determined by using the share price of the applicable investment fund on the posting date. Restored funds will not incur breakage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Participants who are covered by paragraph (d) of this section and who elect to return funds that were withdrawn may also elect to reinstate a

loan which was previously declared to be a taxable distribution.
