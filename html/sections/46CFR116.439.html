The actual length of the space may not exceed 40 meters (131 feet).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the equivalent main vertical zone length under paragraph (c) of this section exceeds 40 meters (131 feet), both decks connected by the balcony must be protected with an automatic sprinkler system meeting NFPA 13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the unobstructed balcony opening area is less than 93 square meters (1,000 square feet), the opening must be protected in accordance with NFPA 13 or other standard specified by the Commandant.
