A Bank may from time to time increase or decrease the amount of stock any member is required to hold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Annual adjustment. A Bank shall calculate annually, in the manner set forth in Sec. 1263.20(a), each member's required minimum holdings of stock in the Bank in which it is a member using calendar year-end financial data provided by the member to the Bank, pursuant to Sec. 1263.31(d), and shall notify each member of the adjustment. The notice shall clearly state that the Bank's calculation of each member's minimum stock holdings is to be used to determine the number of votes that

the member may cast in that year's election of directors and shall identify the State within the district in which the member will vote. A member that does not agree with the Bank's calculation of the minimum stock requirement or with the identification of its voting State may request FHFA to review the Bank's determination. FHFA shall promptly determine the member's minimum required holdings and its proper voting State, which determination shall be final.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual adjustment.

If, in the case of a Bank that has not converted to the capital structure authorized by the GLB Act and after the annual adjustment required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is made, the amount of stock that a member is required to hold is decreased, the Bank may, in its discretion and upon proper application of the member, retire such excess stock, and the Bank shall pay for each share upon surrender of the stock an amount equal to the par value thereof (except that if at any time FHFA finds that the paid-in capital of a Bank is or is likely to be impaired as a result of losses in or depreciation of the assets held, the Bank shall on the order of FHFA withhold from the amount to be paid in retirement of the stock a pro rata share of the amount of such impairment as determined by FHFA) or, at its election, the Bank may credit any part of such payment against the member's debt to the Bank. The Bank's authority to retire such excess stock shall be further subject to the limitations of section 6(f) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1426(f)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A member's stock holdings shall not be reduced under this section to an amount less than required by sections 6(b) and 10(c) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1426(b), 1430(c)).</p>
