In evaluating the relative capability of the applicant to provide such services directly, the Secretary shall take into consideration whether the direct provision of such services is inappropriate because:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provision of such services through contract or other arrangement would be more cost-effective;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provision of such services directly would unnecessarily duplicate existing resources; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provision of such services other than directly would enhance the accessibility or acceptability of such services to the population to be served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The degree to which the applicant intends to integrate services supported by a grant under this part with health services provided under other federally assisted health services or reimbursement programs or projects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The extent that community resources will be utilized by the project; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Consistent with the other requirements of this part, the degree to which and the manner in which the applicant provides specific health services which the Secretary has, through publication of a notice in the Federal Register, established as services which should receive emphasis by applicants.</p>
