                                Sec. 541.104  Two or more other employees.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To qualify as an exempt executive under Sec. 541.100, the  employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more  other employees. The phrase ``two or more other employees'' means two  full-time employees or their equivalent. One full-time and two half-time  employees, for example, are equivalent to two full-time employees. Four  half-time employees are also equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The supervision can be distributed among two, three or more  employees, but each such employee must customarily and regularly direct  the work of two or more other full-time employees or the equivalent.  Thus, for example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers  may have up to two exempt supervisors if each such supervisor  customarily and regularly directs the work of two of those workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee who merely assists the manager of a particular  department and supervises two or more employees only in the actual  manager's absence does not meet this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hours worked by an employee cannot be credited more than once  for different executives. Thus, a shared responsibility for the  supervision of the same two employees in the same department does not  satisfy this requirement. However, a full-time employee who works four  hours for one supervisor and four hours for a different supervisor, for  example, can be credited as a half-time employee for both supervisors.</p>
