However, this  PAH compliance testing cannot be reduced to less than once per year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You must conduct ongoing performance tests every 5 years for air  pollution control devices or vent stacks subject to Sec. 63.1623(a)(4),  (a)(5), (b)(1), and (c) through (e) to demonstrate compliance with the  applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compliance is demonstrated for all sources performing emissions  tests if the average concentration for the three runs comprising the  performance test does not exceed the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.
