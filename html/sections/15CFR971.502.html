                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Administrator establishes terms, conditions and  restrictions relating to conservation of resources, he will employ a  balancing process in the consideration of the state of the technology  being developed, the processing system utilized and the value and  potential use of any waste, the environmental effects of the recovery  activities, economic and resource data, and the national need for hard  mineral resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application must set forth how the applicant's proposed  method of collecting nodules will conserve resources by providing for  the future opportunity for commercial recovery of the unrecovered  balance of the resources in the proposed permit area. Although  preliminary and subject to change, the discussion must include a plan  for the chronology of areas to be mined. This is needed in order for the  Administrator to determine if selective mining, expected to be carried  out in the early years to improve cash flow, is part of a long range  recovery plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the applicant proposes a refining process that does not  include the use of manganese in a productive manner, it may not render  the manganese unavailable to future users by dispersing the tailings  over a vast area unless such a scheme is necessary for the financial  practicability of the commercial recovery activities of the applicant. A  permittee must advise the Administrator in the annual report of the  location, composition and quantity of manganese in tailings which remain  after processing. Should national needs for manganese develop during the  duration of a permit, e.g., in case of national emergency, the  Administrator may cancel the exception granted involving dispersion of  tailings. Applicants seeking an exception would be required to  demonstrate how and in what time frame their commercial recovery  processing activities could be modified to respond to new national  needs.</p>
