                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Handlers handling cherries harvested in a regulated  district may fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in  part by acquiring diversion certificates or by voluntarily diverting  cherries or cherry products in a program approved by the Board, rather  than placing cherries in an inventory reserve. Upon voluntary diversion  and compliance with the provisions of this section, the Board shall  issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate which  shall satisfy any restricted percentage or diversion requirement to the  extent of the Board or Department inspected weight of the cherries  diverted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible diversion. Handler diversion certificates shall be  issued to handlers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with  the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions  that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Such  diversion may take place in any form which the Board, with the approval  of the Secretary, may designate. Tart cherry juice and juice concentrate  may receive diversion credit but only if diverted in forms approved  under the terms of this section. Such forms may include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contribution to a Board-approved food bank or other approved  charitable organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use for new product and new market development;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Export to designated destinations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other uses or disposition, including destruction of the cherries  at the handler's facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. The handler electing to divert cherries through  means authorized under this section shall first notify the Board of such  election. Such notification shall describe in detail the manner in which  the handler proposes to divert cherries including, if the diversion is  to be by means of destruction of the cherries, a detailed description of  the means of destruction and ultimate disposition of the cherries. It  shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be  carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such  supervision is to be paid by the handler. Uniform fees for such  supervision may be established by the Board, pursuant to rules and  regulations approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diversion certificate. The Board shall conduct such supervision  of the handler's diversion of cherries under paragraph (c) of this  section as may be necessary to assure that the cherries are diverted as  authorized. After the diversion has been completed, the   Board shall issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion  certificate indicating the weight of cherries which may be used to  offset any restricted percentage requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transfer of certificates. Within such restrictions as may be  prescribed in rules and regulations, including but not limited to  procedures for transfer of diversion credit and limitations on the type  of certification eligible for transfer, a handler who acquires diversion  certificates representing diverted cherries during any crop year may  transfer such certificates to another handler or handlers. The Board  must be notified in writing whenever such transfers take place during a  crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish  rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of  this section.
