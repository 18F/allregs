                            <p class="depth0">Since section 502 is intended to protect the funds or other property  of labor organizations and trusts in which labor organizations are  interested, bonds under this section should allow for enforcement or  recovery for the benefit of the labor organization or trust concerned by  those ordinarily authorized to act for it in such matters. For example,  in the case of a local labor organization, a bond would not be  appropriate under section 502 if it protected only the interests of a  national or international labor organization with which the local labor  organization is affiliated or if it designated as the insured only some  particular officer of the organization who does not legally represent it  in similar formal instruments.
