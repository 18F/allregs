                            <p class="depth0">The requirements of this section apply to allocating and obligating funds for the Recreational Boating Access subprogram.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State fish and wildlife agency must allocate funds from each annual apportionment under the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act for use in the subprogram.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Over each 5-year period, the total allocation for the subprogram in each of the Service's geographic regions must average at least 15 percent of the Sport Fish Restoration funds apportioned to the States in that Region. As long as this requirement is met, an individual State agency may allocate more or less than 15 percent of its annual apportionment in a single Federal fiscal year with the Regional Director's approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Regional Director calculates Regional allocation averages for separate 5-year periods that coincide with Federal fiscal years 2008-2012, 2013-2017, 2018-2022, and each subsequent 5-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the total Regional allocation for a 5-year period is less than 15 percent, the State agencies may, in a memorandum of understanding, agree among themselves which of them will make the additional allocations to eliminate the Regional shortfall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This paragraph applies if State fish and wildlife agencies do not agree on which of them will make additional allocations to bring the average Regional allocation to at least 15 percent over a 5-year period. If the agencies do not agree:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Regional Director may require States in the Region to make changes needed to achieve the minimum 15-percent Regional average before the end of the fifth year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Director must not require a State to increase or decrease its allocation if the State has allocated at least 15 percent over the 5-year period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A Federal obligation of these allocated funds must occur by the end of the fourth consecutive Federal fiscal year after the Federal fiscal year in which the funds first became available for allocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the agency's application to use these funds has not led to a Federal obligation by that time, these allocated funds become available for reapportionment among the State fish and wildlife agencies for the following fiscal year.</p>
