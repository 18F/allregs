The State agency shall provide a hearing procedure whereby farmers or farmers' markets adversely affected by certain actions of the State agency may appeal those actions.

When a vendor is disqualified due in whole or in part to violations in Sec. 246.12(l)(1), such notification must include the following statement: ``This disqualification from WIC may result in disqualification as a retailer in SNAP. Such disqualification is not subject to administrative or judicial review under SNAP.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The opportunity to appeal the adverse action within a time period specified by the State agency in its notification of adverse action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adequate advance notice of the time and place of the administrative review to provide all parties involved sufficient time to prepare for the review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The opportunity to present its case and at least one opportunity to reschedule the administrative review date upon specific request. The State agency may set standards on how many review dates can be scheduled, provided that a minimum of two review dates is allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses. When necessary to protect the identity of WIC Program investigators, such examination may be conducted behind a protective screen or other device (also referred to as an ``in camera'' examination).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The opportunity to be represented by counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The opportunity to examine prior to the review the evidence upon which the State agency's action is based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An impartial decision-maker, whose determination is based solely on whether the State agency has correctly applied Federal and State statutes, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the Program, according to the evidence presented at the review. The State agency may appoint a reviewing official, such as a chief hearing officer or judicial officer, to review appeal decisions to ensure that they conform to approved policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Written notification of the review decision, including the basis for the decision, within 90 days from the date of receipt of the request for an administrative review from a vendor, farmer, or farmer's market, and within 60 days from the date of receipt of a local agency's request for an administrative review. These timeframes are only administrative requirements for the State agency and do not provide a basis for overturning the State agency's adverse action if a decision is not made within the specified timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Abbreviated administrative review procedures. Except when the State agency decides to provide full administrative reviews for the adverse actions listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the State agency must develop procedures for an abbreviated administrative review of the adverse actions listed in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. At a minimum, these procedures

must provide the vendor, farmer, or farmers' market with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written notification of the adverse action, the procedures to follow to obtain an abbreviated administrative review, the cause(s) for and the effective date of the action, and an opportunity to provide a written response; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A decision-maker who is someone other than the person who rendered the initial decision on the action and whose determination is based solely on whether the State agency has correctly applied Federal and State statutes, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the Program, according to the information provided to the vendor, farmer, or farmers' market concerning the cause(s) for the adverse action and the response from the vendor, farmer, or farmers' market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Written notification of the review decision, including the basis for the decision, within 90 days of the date of receipt of the request for an administrative review. This timeframe is only an administrative requirement for the State agency and does not provide a basis for overturning the State agency's adverse action if a decision is not made within the specified timeframe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continuing responsibilities. Appealing an action does not relieve a local agency, farmer or farmers' market or vendor that is permitted to continue program operations while its appeal is in process from the responsibility of continued compliance with the terms of any written agreement with the State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Finality and effective date of decisions. The State agency procedures must provide that review decisions rendered under both the full and abbreviated review procedures are the final State agency action. If the adverse action under review has not already taken effect, the State agency must make the action effective on the date of receipt of the review decision by the vendor, farmer or farmers' market or local agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Judicial review. If the review decision upholds the adverse action against the vendor, farmer or farmers' market or local agency, the State agency must inform the vendor, farmer or farmers' market or local agency that it may be able to pursue judicial review of the decision.
