                                Sec. 1.856-1  Definition of real estate investment trust.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and paragraph (b) of this section, and (2) satisfies  the gross income and asset diversification requirements under the  limitations of section 856(c) and Sec. 1.856-2. (See, however,  paragraph (f) of this section, relating to the requirement that, for  taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976, a real estate investment  trust must be an unincorporated trust or unincorporated association).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying conditions. To qualify as a ``real estate investment  trust'', an organization must be one--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which is managed by one or more trustees or directors,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable  shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the  provisions of part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Which, in the case of a taxable year beginning before October 5,  1976, does not hold any property (other than foreclosure property)  primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or  business,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Which is neither (i) a financial institution to which section  585, 586, or 593 applies, nor (ii) an insurance company to which  subchapter L applies,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more  persons, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Which would not be a personal holding company (as defined in  section 542) if all of its gross income constituted personal holding  company income (as defined in section 543).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of status. The conditions described in  subparagraphs (1) through (5) of paragraph (b) of this section must be  met during the entire taxable year and the condition described in  subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of this section must exist during at  least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate  part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. The days during which the  latter condition must exist need not be consecutive. In determining the  minimum number of days during which the condition described in paragraph  (b)(6) of this section is required to exist in a taxable year of less  than 12 months, fractional days shall be disregarded. For example, in a  taxable year of 310 days, the actual number of days prescribed would be  284 \38/73\ days (\310/365\ of 335). The fractional day is disregarded  so that the required condition in such taxable year need exist for only  284 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rules applicable to status requirements. For purposes of  determining whether an organization meets the conditions and  requirements in section 856(a), the following rules shall apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. The  trustee will be considered to hold legal title to the property of the  trust, for purposes of this subparagraph, whether the title is held in  the name of the trust itself, in the name of one or more of the  trustees, or in the name of a nominee for the exclusive benefit of the  trust.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Beneficial ownership. Beneficial ownership shall be evidenced by  transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial  interest, and (subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this  section) must be held by 100 or more persons, determined without  reference to any rules of attribution. Provisions in the trust  instrument or corporate charter or bylaws which permit the trustee or  directors to redeem shares or to refuse to transfer shares in any case  where the trustee or directors, in good faith, believe that a failure to  redeem shares or that a transfer of shares would result in the loss of  status as a real estate investment trust will not render the shares  ``nontransferable.'' For purposes of the regulations under part II of  subchapter M, the terms ``stockholder,'' ``stockholders,''  ``shareholder,'' and ``shareholders'' include holders of beneficial  interest in a real estate investment trust, the terms ``stock,''  ``shares,'' and ``shares of stock'' include certificates of beneficial  interest, and the term ``shares'' includes shares of stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> and (4) and the regulations thereunder and for such purposes an  otherwise qualified real estate investment trust is deemed to satisfy  the ``objective to carry on business'' requirement of paragraph (a) of  Sec. 301.7701-2 of this chapter. (Regulations on Procedure and  Administration).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Property held for sale to customers. In the case of a taxable  year beginning before October 5, 1976, a real estate investment trust  may not hold any property (other than foreclosure property) primarily  for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business.  Whether property is held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of  the trade or business of a real estate investment trust depends upon the  facts and circumstances in each case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Personal holding company. A corporation, trust, or association,  even though it may otherwise meet the requirements of part II of  subchapter M, will not be a real estate investment trust if, by  considering all of its gross income as personal holding company income  under section 543, it would be a personal holding company as defined in  section 542. Thus, if at any time during the last half of the trust's  taxable year more than 50 percent in value of its outstanding stock is  owned (directly or indirectly under the provisions of section 544) by or  for not more than 5 individuals, the stock ownership requirement in  section 542(a)(2) will be met and the trust would be a personal holding  company. See Sec. 1.857-8, relating to record requirements for purposes  of determining whether the trust is a personal holding company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other rules applicable. To the extent that other provisions of  chapter 1 of the Code are not inconsistent with those under part II of  subchapter M there of and the regulations thereunder, such provisions  will apply with respect to both the real estate investment trust and its  shareholders in the same manner that they would apply to any other  organization which would be taxable as a domestic corporation. For  example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxable income of a real estate investment trust is computed in  the same manner as that of a domestic corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 301, relating to distributions of property, applies to  distributions by a real estate investment trust in the same manner as it  would apply to a domestic corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sections 302, 303, 304, and 331 are applicable in determining  whether distributions by a real estate investment trust are to be  treated as in exchange for stock;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Section 305 applies to distributions by a real estate investment  trust of its own stock;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Section 311 applies to distributions by a real estate investment  trust;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Except as provided in section 857(d), earnings and profits of a  real estate investment trust are computed in the same manner as in the  case of a domestic corporation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Section 316, relating to the definition of a dividend, applies  to distributions by a real estate investment trust; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Section 341, relating to collapsible corporations, applies to  gain on the sale or exchange of, or a distribution which is in exchange  for, stock in a real estate investment trust in the same manner that it  would apply to a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2))</em>; sec. 856(g)(2) (90 Stat. 1753; 26 U.S.C. 856(g)(2));  sec. 858(a) (74 Stat. 1008; 26 U.S.C. 858(a)); sec. 859(c) (90 Stat.  1743; 26 U.S.C. 859(c)); sec. 859(e) (90 Stat. 1744; 26 U.S.C. 859(e));  sec. 6001 (68A Stat. 731; 26 U.S.C. 6001); sec. 6011 (68A Stat. 732; 26  U.S.C. 6011); sec. 6071 (68A Stat. 749, 26 U.S.C. 6071); sec. 6091 (68A  Stat. 752; 26 U.S.C. 6091); sec. 7805 (68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805),  Internal Revenue Code of 1954)  [T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4082, Apr. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6928, 32 FR  13221, Sept. 19, 1967; T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11265, Feb. 6, 1981]</p>
