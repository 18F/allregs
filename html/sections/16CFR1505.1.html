                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following definitions apply to this part 1505:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``electrically operated toy or other electrically  operated article intended for use by children'' means any toy, game, or  other article designed, labeled, advertised, or otherwise intended for  use by children which is intended to be powered by electrical current  from nominal 120 volt (110-125 v.) branch circuits. Such articles are  referred to in this part in various contexts as ``toy'' or  ``electrically operated toy.'' If the package (including packing  materials) of the toy or other article is intended to be used with the  product, it is considered to be part of the toy or other article. This  definition does not include components which are powered by circuits of  30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) or less, articles designed primarily  for use by adults which may be used incidentally by children, or video  games.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term video games means video game hardware systems, which  are games that both produce a dynamic video image, either on a viewing  screen that is part of the video game or,   through connecting cables, on a television set, and have some way to  control the movement of at least some portion of the video image.
