                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appeal of decision of State Director. Any party adversely  affected by the decision of the State Director after State Director  review, under Sec. 3165.3(b) of this title, of a notice of violation or  assessment or of an instruction, order, or decision may appeal that  decision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals pursuant to the  regulations set out in part 4 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal from decision on a proposed penalty after a hearing on  the record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party adversely affected by the decision of an  Administrative Law Judge on a proposed penalty after a hearing on the  record under Sec. 3165.3(c) of this title may appeal that decision to  the Interior Board of Land Appeals pursuant to the regulations in part 4  of this title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In lieu of a hearing on the record under Sec. 3165.3(c) of this  title, any party adversely affected by the decision of the State  Director on a proposed penalty may waive the opportunity for such a  hearing on the record by appealing directly to the Interior Board of  Land Appeals under part 4 of this title. However, if the right to a  hearing on the record is waived, further appeal to the District Court  under section 109(j) of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act  is precluded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of an appeal on an approval/decision by a State Director  or Administrative Law Judge. All decisions and approvals of a State  Director or Administrator Law Judge under this part shall remain  effective pending appeal unless the Interior Board of Land Appeals  determines otherwise upon consideration of the standards stated in this  paragraph. The provisions of 43 CFR 4.21(a) shall not apply to any  decision or approval of a State Director or Administrative Law Judge  under this part. A petition for a stay of a decision or approval of a  State Director or Administrative Law Judge shall be filed with the  Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals,  Department of the Interior, and shall show   sufficient justification based on the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or  denied,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The likelihood of irreparable harm to the appellant or resources  if the stay is not granted, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the public interest favors granting the stay.  Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the discretionary authority of  a State Director or Administrative Law Judge to stay the effectiveness  of a decision subject to appeal pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this  section upon a request by an adversely affected party or on the State  Director's or Administrative Law Judge's own initiative. If a State  Director or Administrative Law Judge denies such a request, the  requester can petition for a stay of the denial decision by filing a  petition with the Interior Board of Land Appeals that addresses the  standards described above in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this section, any appeal filed pursuant to  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not result in a suspension  of the requirement for compliance with the order or decision from which  the appeal is taken unless the Interior Board of Land Appeals determines  that suspension of the requirements of the order or decision will not be  detrimental to the interests of the lessor or upon submission and  acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss  or damage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of appeal on assessments and penalties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as  provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an appeal filed pursuant  to paragraph (a) of this section shall suspend the accumulation of  additional daily assessments. However, the pendency of an appeal shall  not bar the authorized officer from assessing civil penalties under  Sec. 3163.2 of this title in the event the operator has failed to abate  the violation which resulted in the assessment. The Board of Land  Appeals may issue appropriate orders to coordinate the pending appeal  and the pending civil penalty proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an  appeal filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall suspend the  accumulation of additional daily civil penalties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an appeal is filed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this  section, the State Director may, within 10 days of receipt of the notice  of appeal, recommend that the Director reinstate the accumulation of  assessments and daily civil penalties until such time as a final  decision is rendered or until the violation is abated. The Director may,  if he/she determines that the public interest requires it, reinstate  such accumulation(s) upon a finding that the violation is causing or  threatening immediate substantial and adverse impacts on public health  and safety, the environment, production accountability, or royalty  income. If the Director does not act on the recommendation to reinstate  the accumulation(s) within 45 days of the filing of the notice of  appeal, the suspension shall continue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When an appeal is filed under paragraph (a) of this section from  a decision to require drainage protection, BLM's drainage determination  will remain in effect during the appeal, notwithstanding the provisions  of 43 CFR 4.21. Compensatory royalty and interest determined under 30  CFR Part 218 will continue to accrue throughout the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Judicial review. Any person who is aggrieved by a final order of  the Secretary under this section may seek review of such order in the  United States District Court for the judicial district in which the  alleged violation occurred. Because section 109 of the Federal Oil and  Gas Royalty Management Act provides for judicial review of civil penalty  determinations only where a person has requested a hearing on the  record, a waiver of such hearing precludes further review by the  district court. Review by the district court shall be on the  administrative record only and not de novo. Such an action shall be  barred unless filed within 90   days after issuance of final decision as provided in Sec. 4.21 of this  title.
