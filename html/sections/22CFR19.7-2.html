                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A spousal agreement between a participant and a spouse may waive or fix the level of a regular survivor annuity under Sec. 19.11-3. If an agreement is filed, it will assure the spouse that the agreed-upon level of survivor annuity will be paid, irrespective of a future divorce provided the survivor meets the definition of ``former spouse'' in Sec. 19.2(k). If an agreement is not filed, the participant's annuity will be reduced under Sec. 19.10-2 to provide the maximum regular survivor annuity for the spouse, but in the event of a future divorce if the spouse meets the definition of ``former spouse,'' that person will be entitled only to a pro rata share of the survivor annuity. An agreement under this paragraph may be filed with PER/ER/RET at any time prior to retirement (commencement of the principal's annuity).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A spousal agreement between an annuitant and a spouse filed with PER/ER/RET before commencement of a supplemental annuity for recall service may waive a supplemental survivor annuity that would otherwise be provided for a spouse under Sec. 19.10-6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A spousal agreement between a participant or former participant and a spouse may be filed with PER/ER/RET at any time in accordance with Sec. 19.10-5 and provide for an additional survivor annuity for the spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A spousal agreement filed under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) remains valid and binding in the event of divorce if the spouse qualifies as a former spouse.</p>
