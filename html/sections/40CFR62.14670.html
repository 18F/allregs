                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required under 40 CFR 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in Sec. 62.14650.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in Sec. 62.14635 or established under Sec. 62.14640. Operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging period is established under Sec. 62.14640. Operating limits do not apply during performance tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish operating limits during the performance test.</p>
