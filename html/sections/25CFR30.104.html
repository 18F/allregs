The definition meets the requirements in 20 U.S.C. 6311(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effective in the 2005-2006 school year, the academic content and student achievement standards, assessments, and the definition of AYP are those of the State where the school is located, unless an alternative definition of AYP is proposed by the tribal governing body or school board and approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the geographic boundaries of the school include more than one State, the tribal governing body or school board may choose the State definition it desires. Such decision shall be communicated to the Secretary in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section does not mean that the school is under the jurisdiction of the State for any purpose, rather a reference to the State is solely for the purpose of using the State's assessment, academic content and student achievement standards, and definition of AYP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The use of the State's definition of AYP does not diminish or alter the Federal Government's trust responsibility for Indian education.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> School boards or tribal governing bodies may seek a waiver that may include developing their own definition of AYP, or adopting or modifying an existing definition of AYP that has been accepted by the Department of Education. The Secretary is committed to providing technical assistance to a school, or a group of schools, to develop an alternative definition of AYP.</p><p class="depth2">Alternative Definition of AYP</p>
