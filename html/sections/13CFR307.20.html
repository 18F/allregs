Problematic practices for which EDA may disallow a portion of an RLF Grant and recover the pro-rata Federal Share (as defined in Sec. 314.5 of this chapter) include the RLF Recipient:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Having RLF loans that are more than 120 days delinquent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Having excess cash sequestered for 12 months or longer and EDA has not approved an extension request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Making an ineligible loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failing to disburse the EDA funds in accordance with the time schedule prescribed in the RLF Grant; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determining that it does not wish to further invest in the RLF or cannot maintain operations at the degree originally contemplated upon receipt of the RLF Grant and requests that a portion of the RLF Grant be disallowed, and EDA agrees to allow the disallowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liquidation upon termination. When EDA approves the termination of an RLF Grant, EDA may assign or transfer assets of the RLF to an RLF Third Party for liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terms. The following terms will govern any liquidation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EDA shall have sole discretion in choosing the RLF Third Party;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The RLF Third Party may be an Eligible Applicant or a for-profit organization not otherwise eligible for Investment Assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EDA may enter into an agreement with the RLF Third Party to liquidate the assets of one or more RLFs or RLF Recipients;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> EDA may allow the RLF Third Party to retain a portion of the RLF assets, consistent with the agreement referenced in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, as reasonable compensation for services rendered in the liquidation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> EDA may require additional reasonable terms and conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Distribution of proceeds. The proceeds resulting from any liquidation upon termination shall be distributed in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First, for any third party liquidation costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second, for the payment of EDA's Federal Share; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Third, if any proceeds remain, to the RLF Recipient.
