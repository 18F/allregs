                                Sec. 3481.4  Temporary interruption in coal severance.

Sec. 3481.4-1  Can I temporarily interrupt coal severance and still be qualified as producing?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Yes, a temporary interruption in coal severance allows you (the lessee/operator) to halt the extraction of coal for a limited period of time without jeopardizing your qualifications under section (2)(a)(2)(A) of MLA to receive additional leases. During the period of a temporary interruption in coal severance, BLM still considers you lease or LMU to be producing so as not to preclude you from receiving a new or transferred lease.
[62 FR 44370, Aug. 20, 1997]


Sec. 3481.4-2  What are some examples of circumstances that qualify for a temporary interruption of coal severance?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Movement, failure, or repair of major equipment, such as draglines or longwalls; overburden removal; adverse weather; employee absences;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inability to sever coal due to orders issued by governmental authorities for cessation or relocation of the coal severance operations; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inability to sell or distribute coal severed from the lease or LMU out of or away from the lease or LMU.
[62 FR 44370, Aug. 20, 1997]


Sec. 3481.4-3  Does a temporary interruption in coal severance affect the diligence requirements applicable to my lease or LMU?</p><p class="depth0">No, a temporary interruption in coal severance covered by Sec. Sec. 3481.4-1 to 3481.4-4 does not change the diligence requirements of subpart 3483 applicable to your lease or LMU.
[62 FR 44370, Aug. 20, 1997]


Sec. 3481.4-4  What is the aggregate amount of time I can temporarily interrupt coal severance and have BLM consider my lease or LMU producing?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you (the lessee/operator) want BLM to consider your lease or LMU to be producing, the aggregate of all temporary interruptions in coal severance from your lease or LMU must not exceed 1 year in the 5-consecutive-year

period immediately preceding the date of BLM's determination of lessee qualifications under Sec. 3472.1-2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BLM will not count toward the aggregate interruption limit described in paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any interruption in coal severance that is 14 days or less in duration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any suspension granted under Sec. 3483.3 of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any BLM-approved suspension of the requirements of Sec. 3472.1-2(e)(1) of this part for reasons of strikes, the elements, or casualties not attributable to the operator/lessee before diligent development is achieved.
