                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 1537.110(g), insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Government-Contractor Relations (JUN 1999)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the  services to be delivered under this contract by the contractor to the  Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree  that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the  contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is,  therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties  a full understanding of their respective obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be placed in a position where they are under the supervision,  direction, or evaluation of a Government employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration  or control over Government personnel, or over personnel of other  Contractors under other EPA contracts, or become a part of the  Government organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be used in administration or supervision of Government  procurement activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employee relationship. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The services to be performed under  this contract do not require the Contractor or his/her personnel to  exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal  judgment and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued  by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under its responsibility for  good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel  who enter the Government installation or who travel on Government  transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish  any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non- personal services contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inapplicability of employee benefits. This contract does not  create an employer-employee relationship. Accordingly, entitlements and  benefits applicable to such relationships do not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payments by the Government under this contract are not subject  to Federal income tax withholdings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payments by the Government under this contract are not subject  to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Contractor is not entitled to unemployment compensation  benefits under the Social Security Act, as amended, by virtue of  performance of this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Contractor is not entitled to workman's compensation  benefits by virtue of this contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The entire consideration and benefits to the Contractor for  performance of this contract is contained in the provisions for payment  under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice. It is the Contractor's, as well as, the Government's  responsibility to monitor contract activities and notify the Contracting  Officer if the Contractor believes that the intent of this clause has  been or may be violated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor should notify the Contracting Officer in writing  promptly, within ____ (to be negotiated and inserted into the basic  contract at contract award) calendar days from the date of any incident  that the Contractor considers to constitute a violation of this clause.  The notice should include the date, nature and circumstance of the  conduct, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or  Contractor official or employee involved or knowledgeable about such  conduct, identify any documents or substance of any oral communication  involved in the conduct, and the estimate in time by which the  Government must respond to this notice to minimize cost, delay or  disruption of performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contracting Officer will promptly, within ____ (to be  negotiated and inserted into the basic contract at contract award)  calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in writing.  In responding, the Contracting Officer will either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Confirm that the conduct is in violation and when necessary  direct the mode of further performance,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Countermand any communication regarded as a violation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Deny that the conduct constitutes a violation and when  necessary direct the mode of further performance; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the event the notice is inadequate to make a decision,  advise the Contractor what additional information is required, and  establish the date by which it should be furnished by the Contractor and  the date thereafter by which the Government will respond.</p><p class="depth4">(End of clause)  [64 FR 30444, June 8, 1999]</p>
