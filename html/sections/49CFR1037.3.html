                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In computing the amount of the loss for which the carrier will pay there will be deducted from the gross amount of the ascertained actual loss one-fourth of 1 percent of the established loading weight to cover invisible loss and waste; provided, however, that where grain and grain products heat in transit and investigation shows that the invisible loss resulting therefrom exceeded one-fourth of 1 percent of such other amount as may hereafter be fixed in the manner above stated, and that the carrier is not otherwise liable for said loss, then the ascertained actual amount of the invisible loss due to heating of the grain and grain products will be deducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where investigation discloses a defect in equipment, seal or seal record, or a transfer in transit by the carrier of a carload of bulk grain or

grain products upon which the unloading weight is less than the loading weight and the shipper furnishes duly attested certificates showing the correctness of the claimed weight, and investigation fails to show that the discrepancy is due to defective scales or other shipper facilities, or to inaccurate weighing or other error at point of origin or destination, or to fraud, then the resulting claim will be adjusted subject to the deductions authorized in the immediately preceding paragraph (a) of this Sec.  1037.3; provided, however, that the clear record of either the carrier's or shippers' facilities shall not be interpreted as affecting or changing the burden of proof now lawfully resting upon either party. Therefore, movement in a clear-record car is not conclusive evidence of the fact that the car is not defective. It must be considered along with other evidence to determine liability. See paragraph (e) of Sec.  1037.1</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In case of a disputed claim, the records of both the carrier and the claimant affecting the shipment involved shall be available to both parties. These records shall include a written complaint, if any, filed by the shipper with the railroad at the time the car was placed for loading that the car was defective, and the written report of an investigation of the complaint, filed by the railroad with the shipper, if made.</p>
