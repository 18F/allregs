                            <p class="depth0">The income tax convention between the United States and the Swiss Confederation, signed May 24, 1951, and proclaimed by the President of the United States on October 1, 1951, subject to the understanding expressed in the protocol of exchange, referred to in this part as the convention, provides as follows, effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1951:</p><p class="depth0">Article I</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The taxes referred to in this Convention are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of the United States of America: The Federal income taxes, including surtaxes and excess profits taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of The Swiss Confederation: The federal, cantonal and communal taxes on income (total income, earned income, income from property, industrial and commercial profits, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The present Convention shall also apply to any other income or profits tax of a substantially similar character imposed by either contracting State subsequently to the date of signature of the present Convention.</p><p class="depth0">Article II</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As used in this Convention:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term ``United States'' means the United States of America, and when used in a geographical sense means the States, the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The term ``Switzerland'' means The Swiss Confederation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The term ``permanent establishment'' means a branch, office, factory, workshop, warehouse or other fixed place of business, but does not include the casual and temporary use of merely storage facilities, nor does it include an agency unless the agent has and habitually exercises a general authority to negotiate and conclude contracts on behalf of an enterprise or has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders on its behalf. An enterprise of one of the contracting States shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other State merely because it carries on business dealings in such other State through a commission agent, broker or custodian or other independent agent acting in the ordinary course of his business as such. The fact that an enterprise of one of the contracting States maintains in the other State a fixed place of business exclusively for the purchase of goods or merchandise shall not of itself constitute such fixed place of business a permanent establishment of such enterprise. The fact that a corporation of one contracting State has a subsidiary corporation which is a corporation of the other State or which is engaged in trade or business in the other State shall not of itself constitute that subsidiary corporation a permanent establishment of its parent corporation. The maintenance within the territory of one of the contracting States by an enterprise of the other contracting State of a warehouse for convenience of delivery and not for purposes of display shall not of itself constitute a permanent establishment within that territory even though offers of purchase have been obtained by an agent of the

enterprise in that territory and transmitted by him to the enterprise for acceptance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The term ``enterprise of one of the contracting States'' means, as the case may be, ``United States enterprise'' or ``Swiss enterprise''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The term ``United States enterprise'' means an industrial or commercial enterprise or undertaking carried on in the United States by a resident (including an individual, fiduciary and partnership) of the United States or by a United States corporation or other entity; the term ``United States corporation or other entity'' means a corporation or other entity created or organized under the law of the United States or of any State or Territory of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The term ``Swiss enterprise'' means an industrial or commercial enterprise or undertaking carried on in Switzerland by an individual resident in Switzerland or by a Swiss corporation or other entity; the term ``Swiss corporation or other entity'' means a corporation or institution or foundation having juridical personality, or a partnership (association ``en nom collectif'' or ``en commandite''), or other association without juridical personality, created or organized under Swiss laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The term ``competent authorities'' means, in the case of the United States, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury; and in the case of Switzerland, the Director of the Federal Tax Administration as authorized by the Federal Department of Finances and Customs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The term ``industrial or commercial profits'' includes manufacturing, mercantile, mining, financial and insurance profits, but does not include income in the form of dividends, interest, rents or royalties, or remuneration for personal services: Provided, however, that such excepted items of income shall, subject to the provisions of this Convention, be taxed separately or together with industrial or commercial profits in accordance with the laws of the contracting States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the application of the provisions of the present Convention by one of the contracting States any term not otherwise defined shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which such term has under its own tax laws.</p><p class="depth0">Article III</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(a)</em> A Swiss enterprise shall not be subject to taxation by the United States in respect of its industrial and commercial profits unless it is engaged in trade or business in the United States through a permanent establishment situated therein. If it is so engaged the United States may impose its tax upon the entire income of such enterprise from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A United States enterprise shall not be subject to taxation by Switzerland in respect of its industrial and commercial profits except as to such profits allocable to its permanent establishment situated in Switzerland.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No account shall be taken in determining the tax in one of the contracting States of the mere purchase of merchandise therein by an enterprise of the other State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where an enterprise of one of the contracting States is engaged in trade or business in the territory of the other contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall be attributed to such permanent establishment the industrial or commercial profits which it might be expected to derive if it were an independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing at arm's length with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In the determination of the industrial or commercial profits of the permanent establishment there shall be allowed as deductions all expenses which are reasonably applicable to the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The competent authorities of the two contracting States may lay down rules by agreement for the apportionment of industrial and commercial profits.</p><p class="depth0">Article IV</p><p class="depth0">Where an enterprise of one of the contracting States, by reason of its participation in the management or the financial structure of an enterprise of the other contracting State, makes with or imposes on the latter, in their commercial or financial relations, conditions different from those which would be made with an independent enterprise, any profits which would normally have accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of those conditions have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">Article V</p><p class="depth0">Income which an enterprise of one of the contracting States derives from the operation of ships or aircraft registered in that State shall be taxable only in the State in which such ships or aircraft are registered.</p><p class="depth0">Article VI</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The rate of tax imposed by one of the contracting States upon dividends derived from sources within such State by a resident or corporation or other entity of the other contracting State not having a permanent establishment in the former State shall not exceed 15 percent: Provided, however, that this paragraph shall have no application to Swiss tax in the case of dividends derived from Switzerland by a Swiss citizen (who is

not also a citizen of the United States) resident in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is agreed, however, that such rate of tax shall not exceed five percent if the shareholder is a corporation controlling, directly or indirectly, at least 95 percent of the entire voting power in the corporation paying the dividend, and if not more than 25 percent of the gross income of such paying corporation is derived from interest and dividends, other than interest and dividends received from its own subsidiary corporations. Such reduction of the rate to five percent shall not apply if the relationship of the two corporations has been arranged or is maintained primarily with the intention of securing such reduced rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Switzerland may collect its tax without regard to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article but will make refund of the tax so collected in excess of the tax computed at the reduced rates provided in such paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0">Article VII</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The rate of tax imposed by one of the contracting States on interest on bonds, securities, notes, debentures or on any other form of indebtedness (including mortgages or bonds secured by real property) derived from sources within such contracting State by a resident or corporation or other entity of the other contracting State not having a permanent establishment in the former State shall not exceed five percent: Provided, however, that this paragraph shall have no application to Swiss tax in the case of interest derived from Switzerland by a Swiss citizen (who is not also a citizen of the United States) resident in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Switzerland may collect its tax without regard to paragraph (1) of this Article but will make refund of the tax so collected in excess of the tax computed at the reduced

works, patents, designs, plans, secret processes and formulae, trademarks, and other like property and rights (including rentals and like payments in respect to motion picture films or for the use of

establishment in the former State shall be exempt from taxation in such former State.</p><p class="depth0">Article IX</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Income from real property (including gains derived from the sale or exchange of such property but not including interest from mortgages or bonds secured by real property) and royalties in respect of the operation of mines, quarries, or other natural resources, shall be taxable only in the contracting State in which such property, mines, quarries, or other natural resources are situated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A resident or corporation or other entity of one of the contracting States deriving any such income from such property within the other contracting State may, for any taxable year, elect to be subject to the tax of such other contracting State, on a net basis, as if such resident or corporation or entity were engaged in trade or business within such other contracting State through a permanent establishment therein during such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Article X</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual resident of Switzerland shall be exempt from United States tax upon compensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States (including the practice of the liberal professions and rendition of services as director) if he is temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceding a total of 188 days during the taxable year and either of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> His compensation is received for such
