By Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1946 (3 CFR,  1943-1949 Comp., p. 1064; 60 Stat. 1095, effective July 16, 1946), the  Commission was abolished and its functions were transferred to the  Federal Security Agency to be performed by a newly created Bureau of  Employees' Compensation within such Agency. By Reorganization Plan No.  19 of 1950 (15 FR 3178, 3 CFR, 1949-1954 Comp., page 1010, 64 Stat.  1271), said Bureau was transferred to the Department of Labor (DOL), and  the authority formerly vested in the Administrator, Federal Security  Agency, was vested in the Secretary of Labor. By Reorganization Plan No.  6 of 1950 (15 FR 3174, 3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., page 1004, 64 Stat.  1263), the Secretary of Labor was authorized to make from time to time  such provisions as he shall deem appropriate, authorizing the  performance of any of his functions by any other officer, agency, or  employee of the DOL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In 1972, two separate organizational units were established  within the Bureau: an Office of Workmen's Compensation Programs (37 FR  20533) and an Office of Federal Employees' Compensation (37 FR 22979).  In 1974, these two units were abolished and one organizational unit, the  Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, was established in lieu of the  Bureau of Employees' Compensation (39 FR 34722).</p><p class="depth2">SUBCHAPTER B_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION ACT</p>
