                            <p class="depth0">Former employees of the Corporation must abide by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 5 CFR 737.1 through 737.25, which bar certain acts by former Government employees that may reasonably give the appearance of making unfair use of prior Government employment and affiliations. Violation of those provisions will give rise to Corporation enforcement proceedings as provided in Sec. 905.737-102, and may also result in criminal sanctions, as provided in 18 U.S.C. 207.
