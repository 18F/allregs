                                Sec. 2001.80  Prescribed standard forms.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The purpose of the standard forms is to promote the  implementation of the government-wide information security program.  Standard forms are prescribed when their use will enhance the protection  of national security information and/or will reduce the costs associated  with its protection. The use of the standard forms prescribed is  mandatory for agencies of the executive branch that create or handle  national security information. As appropriate, these agencies may  mandate the use of these forms by their contractors, licensees, or  grantees who are authorized access to national security information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waivers. Except for the SF 312, ``Classified Information  Nondisclosure Agreement,'' and the SF 714, ``Financial Disclosure  Report,'' (which are waiverable by the Director of National  Intelligence, as the Security Executive Agent, under E.O. 13467,  Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment,  Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to  Classified National Security Information) only the Director of ISOO may  grant a waiver from the use of the prescribed standard forms. To apply  for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed alternative form to the  Director of ISOO along with its justification for use. The Director of  ISOO will review the request and notify the agency of the decision.  Waivers approved prior to December 29, 2009, remain in effect and are  subject to review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Availability. Agencies may obtain copies of the standard forms  prescribed by ordering through FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP or from the GSA  Consumer Global Supply Centers, or the GSA Advantage on-line service.  Some of these standard forms can be downloaded from the GSA Forms  Library.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standard Forms. Standard forms required for application to  national security information are as follows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SF 311, Agency Security Classification Management Program Data:  The SF 311 is a data collection form completed by only those executive  branch agencies that create and/or handle classified national security  information. The form is a record of classification management data  provided by the agencies. The agencies submit the completed forms on an  annual basis to ISOO, no later than November 15 following the reporting  period, for inclusion in a report to the President.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The SF 312 is a nondisclosure agreement between the United  States and an employee of the Federal Government or one of its  contractors, licensees, or grantees. The prior execution of this form by  an individual is necessary before the United States Government may grant  that individual access to classified information, with the exception of  an emergency as defined in section 4.2(b) of the Order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Electronic signatures on SF-312s are prohibited.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The SF 312 is the current authorized form; if an employee  originally signed the now outdated SF 189 or SF 189-A, or a form under  an approved waiver, as agreement to nondisclosure, the forms remain  valid. The SF 189 and SF 189-A are no longer available for use with new  employees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The use of the ``Security Debriefing Acknowledgement'' portion  of the SF 312 is optional at the discretion of the implementing agency.  If an agency chooses not to record its debriefing by signing/dating the  debriefing section of the SF 312, then the agency shall provide an  alternative record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An authorized representative of a contractor, licensee, grantee,  or other non-Government organization, acting as a designated agent of  the United States, may witness the execution of the SF 312 by another  non-Government employee, and may accept it on behalf of the United  States. Also, an employee of a United States agency may witness the  execution of the SF 312 by an employee, contractor, licensee, or grantee  of another United States agency, provided that an authorized United  States Government official or, for non-Government employees only, a  designated agent of the United States subsequently accepts by signature  the SF 312 on behalf of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The provisions of the SF 312, the SF 189, and the SF 189-A do  not supersede the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 2302,   which pertain to the protected disclosure of information by Government  employees, or any other laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Each agency must retain its executed copies of the SF 312, SF  189, and SF 189-A in file systems from which an agreement can be  expeditiously retrieved in the event that the United States must seek  its enforcement or a subsequent employer must confirm its prior  execution. The original, or a legally enforceable facsimile that is  retained in lieu of the original, such as microfiche, microfilm,  computer disk, or electronic storage medium, must be retained for 50  years following its date of execution. For agreements executed by  civilian employees of the United States Government, an agency may store  the executed copy of the SF 312 and SF 189 in the United States Office  of Personnel Management's Official Personnel Folder as a long-term  (right side) document for that employee. An agency may permit its  contractors, licensees, and grantees to retain the executed agreements  of their employees during the time of employment. Upon the termination  of employment, the contractors, licensee, or grantee shall deliver the  original or legally enforceable facsimile of the executed SF 312, SF  189, or SF 189-A of that employee to the Government agency primarily  responsible for his or her classified work. A contractor, licensee, or  grantee of an agency participating in the National Industrial Security  Program shall provide the copy or legally enforceable facsimile of the  executed SF 312, SF 189, or SF 189-A of a terminated employee to their  cognizant security office. Each agency shall inform ISOO of the file  systems that it uses to store these agreements for each category of  affected individuals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Only the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security  Executive Agent, may grant an agency's request for a waiver from the use  of the SF 312. To apply for a waiver, an agency must submit its proposed  alternative nondisclosure agreement to the Director of the Special  Security Center (SSC), Office of the Director of National Intelligence,  along with a justification for its use. The Director, SSC, shall request  a determination about the alternative agreement's enforceability from  the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The national stock number for the SF 312 is 7540-01-280-5499.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SF 700, Security Container Information: The SF 700 provides the  names, addresses, and telephone numbers of employees who are to be  contacted if the security container to which the form pertains is found  open and unattended. The form also includes the means to maintain a  current record of the security container's combination and provides the  envelope to be used to forward this information to the appropriate  agency activity or official. If an agency determines, as part of its  risk management strategy, that a security container information form is  required, the SF 700 shall be used. Parts 2 and 2A of each completed  copy of SF 700 shall be classified at the highest level of  classification of the information authorized for storage in the security  container. A new SF 700 must be completed each time the combination to  the security container is changed. The national stock number for the SF  700 is 7540-01-214-5372.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> SF 701, Activity Security Checklist: The SF 701 provides a  systematic means to make a thorough end-of-day security inspection for a  particular work area and to allow for employee accountability in the  event that irregularities are discovered. If an agency determines, as  part of its risk management strategy, that an activity security  checklist is required, the SF 701 will be used. Completion, storage, and  disposition of SF 701 will be in accordance with each agency's security  regulations. The national stock number for the SF 701 is 7540-01-213- 7899.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> SF 702, Security Container Check Sheet: The SF 702 provides a  record of the names and times that persons have opened, closed, or  checked a particular container that holds classified information. If an  agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a  security container check sheet is required, the SF 702 will be used.  Completion, storage, and disposal of the SF 702 will be in accordance  with each agency's security regulations. The national stock number of  the SF 702 is 7540-01-213-7900.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> SF 703, TOP SECRET Cover Sheet: The SF 703 serves as a shield to  protect Top Secret classified information from inadvertent disclosure  and to alert observers that Top Secret information is attached to it. If  an agency determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a  TOP SECRET cover sheet is required, the SF 703 will be used. The SF 703  is affixed to the top of the Top Secret document and remains attached  until the document is downgraded, requiring the appropriate  classification level cover sheet, declassified, or destroyed. When the  SF 703 has been appropriately removed, it may, depending upon its  condition, be reused. The national stock number of the SF 703 is 7540- 01-213-7901.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> SF 704, SECRET Cover Sheet: The SF 704 serves as a shield to  protect Secret classified information from inadvertent disclosure and to  alert observers that Secret information is attached to it. If an agency  determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a SECRET cover  sheet is required, the SF 704 will be used. The SF 704 is affixed to the  top of the Secret document and remains attached until the document is  downgraded, requiring the appropriate classification level cover sheet,  declassified, or destroyed. When the SF 704 has been appropriately  removed, it may, depending upon its condition, be reused. The national  stock number of the SF 704 is 7540-01-213-7902.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> SF 705, CONFIDENTIAL Cover Sheet: The SF 705 serves as a shield  to protect Confidential classified information from inadvertent  disclosure and to alert observers that Confidential information is  attached to it. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management  strategy, that a CONFIDENTIAL cover sheet is required, the SF 705 will  be used. The SF 705 is affixed to the top of the Confidential document  and remains attached until the document is destroyed. When the SF 705  has been appropriately removed, it may, depending upon its condition, be  reused. The national stock number of the SF 704 is 7540-01-213-7903.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> SF 706, TOP SECRET Label: The SF 706 is used to identify and  protect electronic media and other media that contain Top Secret  information. The SF 706 is used instead of the SF 703 for media other  than documents. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management  strategy, that a TOP SECRET label is required, the SF 706 will be used.  The SF 706 is affixed to the medium containing Top Secret information in  a manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which  the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be  removed. The national stock number of the SF 706 is 7540-01-207-5536.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> SF 707, SECRET Label: The SF 707 is used to identify and  protect electronic media and other media that contain Secret  information. The SF 707 is used instead of the SF 704 for media other  than documents. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management  strategy, that a SECRET label is required, the SF 707 will be used. The  SF 707 is affixed to the medium containing Secret information in a  manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which  the medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be  removed. The national stock number of the SF 707 is 7540-01-207-5537.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> SF 708, CONFIDENTIAL Label: The SF 708 is used to identify and  protect electronic media and other media that contain Confidential  information. The SF 708 is used instead of the SF 705 for media other  than documents. If an agency determines, as part of its risk management  strategy, that a CONFIDENTIAL label is required, the SF 708 will be  used. The SF 708 is affixed to the medium containing Confidential  information in a manner that would not adversely affect operation of  equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied,  it cannot be removed. The national stock number of the SF 708 is 7540- 01-207-5538.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> SF 709, CLASSIFIED Label: The SF 709 is used to identify and  protect electronic media and other media that contain classified  information pending a determination by the classifier of the specific  classification level of the information. If an agency determines, as  part of its risk management strategy, that a CLASSIFIED label is  required, the SF 709 will be used. The SF 709 is affixed to the medium  containing classified information in a manner that would not adversely  affect operation of   equipment in which the medium is used. Once the label has been applied,  it cannot be removed. When a classifier has made a determination of the  specific level of classification of the information contained on the  medium, either the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 shall be affixed on top of  the SF 709 so that only the SF 706, SF 707, or SF 708 is visible. The  national stock number of the SF 709 is 7540-01-207-5540.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> SF 710, UNCLASSIFIED Label: In a mixed environment in which  classified and unclassified information are being processed or stored,  the SF 710 is used to identify electronic media and other media that  contain unclassified information. Its function is to aid in  distinguishing among those media that contain either classified or  unclassified information in a mixed environment. If an agency  determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that an  UNCLASSIFIED label is required, the SF 710 will be used. The SF 710 is  affixed to the medium containing unclassified information in a manner  that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which the  medium is used. Once the label has been applied, it cannot be removed.  However, the label is small enough so that it can be wholly covered by a  SF 706, SF 707, SF 708, or SF 709 if the medium subsequently contains  classified information. The national stock number of the SF 710 is 7540- 01-207-5539.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> SF 711, DATA DESCRIPTOR Label: The SF 711 is used to identify  additional safeguarding controls that pertain to classified information  that is stored or contained on electronic or other media. If an agency  determines, as part of its risk management strategy, that a DATA  DESCRIPTOR label is required, the SF 711 will be used. The SF 711 is  affixed to the electronic medium containing classified information in a  manner that would not adversely affect operation of equipment in which  the medium is used. The SF 711 is ordinarily used in conjunction with  the SF 706, SF 707, SF 708, or SF 709, as appropriate. Once the label  has been applied, it cannot be removed. The SF 711 provides spaces for  information that should be completed as required. The national stock  number of the SF 711 is 7540-01-207-5541.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> SF 714, Financial Disclosure Report: When required by an agency  head or by the Director of National Intelligence, as the Security  Executive Agent, the SF 714 contains information that is used to make  personnel security determinations, including whether to grant a security  clearance; to allow access to classified information, sensitive areas,  and equipment; or to permit assignment to sensitive national security  positions. The data may later be used as a part of a review process to  evaluate continued eligibility for access to classified information or  as evidence in legal proceedings. The SF 714 assists law enforcement  agencies in obtaining pertinent information in the preliminary stages of  potential espionage and counter terrorism cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> SF 715, Government Declassification Review Tab: The SF 715 is  used to record the status of classified national security information  reviewed for declassification. The SF 715 shall be used in all  situations that call for the use of a tab as part of the processing of  records determined to be of permanent historical value. The national  stock number for the SF 715 is 7540-01-537-4689.</p>
