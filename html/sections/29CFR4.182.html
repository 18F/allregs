                                Sec. 4.182  Overtime pay of service employees entitled to fringe benefits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Reference is made in Sec. 4.180 to the rules prescribed by section 6 of the Act which permit exclusion of certain fringe benefits and equivalents provided pursuant to section 2(a)(2) of the Act from the regular or basic rate of pay when computing overtime compensation of a service employee under the provisions of any other Federal law. As provided in Sec. 4.177, not only those fringe benefits excludable under section 6 as benefits determined and specified under section 2(a)(2), but also equivalent fringe benefits and cash payments furnished in lieu of the specified benefits may be excluded from the regular or basic rate of such an employee. The application of this rule may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The A company pays a service employee $4.50 an hour in cash under a wage determination which requires a monetary rate of not less than $4 and a fringe benefit contribution of 50 cents which would qualify for exclusion from the regular rate under section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The contractor pays the 50 cents in cash because he made no contributions for fringe benefits specified in the determination and the contract. Overtime compensation in this case would be computed on a regular or basic rate of $4 an hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The B company has for some time been paying $4.25 an hour to a service employee as his basic cash wage plus 25 cents an hour as a contribution to a welfare and pension plan, which contribution qualifies for exclusion from the regular rate under the Fair Labor Standards Act. For performance of work under a contract subject to the Act a monetary rate of $4 and a fringe benefit contribution of 50 cents (also qualifying for such exclusion) are specified because they are found to be prevailing for such employees in the locality. The contractor may credit the 25 cent welfare and pension contribution

toward the discharge of his fringe benefit obligation under the contract but must also make an additional contribution of 25 cents for the specified or equivalent fringe benefits or pay the employee an additional 25 cents in cash. These contributions or equivalent payments may be excluded from the employee's regular rate which remains $4.25, the rate agreed upon as the basic cash wage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The C company has been paying $4 an hour as its basic cash wage on which the firm has been computing overtime compensation. For performance of work on a contract subject to the Act the same rate of monetary wages and a fringe benefit contribution of 50 cents an hour (qualifying for exclusion from the regular rate under the Fair Labor Standards Act) are specified in accordance with a determination that these are the monetary wages and fringe benefits prevailing for such employees in the locality. The contractor is required to continue to pay at least $4 an hour in monetary wages and at least this amount must be included in the employee's regular or basic rate for overtime purposes under applicable Federal law. The fringe benefit obligation under the contract would be discharged if 50 cents of the contributions for fringe benefits were for the fringe benefits specified in the contract or equivalent benefits as defined in Sec. 4.177. The company may exclude such fringe benefit contributions from the regular or basic rate of pay of the service employee in computing overtime pay due.</p><p class="depth2">Notice to Employees</p>
