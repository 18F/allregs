In the case of a violation alleged against an ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, or carrier, if the demonstration required by paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section is made by a certification, it must be supported by

evidence that the criteria in paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section have been met, such as an oversight program conducted by or on behalf of the ethanol blender, distributor, reseller or carrier alleged to be in violation, which includes periodic sampling and testing of the gasoline or monitoring the volatility and ethanol content of the gasoline. Such certification shall be deemed sufficient evidence of compliance provided it is not contradicted by specific evidence, such as testing results, and provided that the party has no other reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certification are inaccurate. In the case of a violation alleged against a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, such certification shall be deemed an adequate defense for the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, provided that the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer is able to show certificates for all of the gasoline contained in the storage tank found in violation, and, provided that the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer has no reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certifications are inaccurate.
