                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Positive Protection Devices. The need for longitudinal traffic barrier and other positive protection devices shall be based on an engineering study. The engineering study may be used to develop positive protection guidelines for the agency, or to determine the measures to be applied on an individual project. The engineering study should be based on consideration of the factors and characteristics described in section 630.1106(b). At a minimum, positive protection devices shall be considered in work zone situations that place workers at increased risk from motorized traffic, and where positive protection devices offer the highest potential for increased safety for workers and road users, such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Work zones that provide workers no means of escape from motorized traffic (e.g., tunnels, bridges, etc.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Long duration work zones (e.g., two weeks or more) resulting in substantial worker exposure to motorized traffic;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Projects with high anticipated operating speeds (e.g., 45 mph or greater), especially when combined with high traffic volumes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Work operations that place workers close to travel lanes open to traffic; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Roadside hazards, such as drop-offs or unfinished bridge decks, that will remain in place overnight or longer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exposure Control Measures. Exposure Control Measures should be considered where appropriate to avoid or minimize worker exposure to motorized traffic and exposure of road users to work activities, while also providing adequate consideration to the potential impacts on mobility. A wide range of measures may be appropriate for use on individual projects, such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Full road closures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ramp closures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Median crossovers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Full or partial detours or diversions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Protection of work zone setup and removal operations using rolling road blocks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Performing work at night or during off-peak periods when traffic volumes are lower; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Accelerated construction techniques.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other Traffic Control Measures. Other Traffic Control Measures should be given appropriate consideration for use in work zones to reduce work zone crashes and risks and consequences of motorized traffic intrusion into the work space. These measures, which are not mutually exclusive and should be considered in combination as appropriate, include a wide range of other traffic control measures such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Effective, credible signing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Changeable message signs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Arrow panels;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Warning flags and lights on signs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Longitudinal and lateral buffer space;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Trained flaggers and spotters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Enhanced flagger station setups;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Intrusion alarms;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Rumble strips;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Pace or pilot vehicle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> High quality work zone pavement markings and removal of misleading markings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Channelizing device spacing reduction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Longitudinal channelizing barricades;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Work zone speed management (including changes to the regulatory speed and/or variable speed limits);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Law enforcement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Automated speed enforcement (where permitted by State/local laws);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Drone radar;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Worker and work vehicle/equipment visibility;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Worker training;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Public information and traveler information; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Temporary traffic signals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers. (1) A number of conditions may indicate the need for or benefit of uniformed law enforcement in work zones. The presence of a uniformed law enforcement officer and marked law enforcement vehicle in view of motorized traffic on a highway project can affect driver behavior, helping to maintain appropriate speeds and improve driver alertness through the work zone. However, such law enforcement presence is not a substitute for the temporary traffic control devices required by Part 6 of the MUTCD. In general, the need for law enforcement is greatest on projects with high traffic speeds and volumes, and where the work zone is expected to result in substantial disruption to or changes in normal traffic flow patterns. Specific project conditions should be examined to determine the need for or potential benefit of law enforcement, such as the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Frequent worker presence adjacent to high-speed traffic without positive protection devices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Traffic control setup or removal that presents significant risks to workers and road users;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Complex or very short term changes in traffic patterns with significant potential for road user confusion or worker risk from traffic exposure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Night work operations that create substantial traffic safety risks for workers and road users;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Existing traffic conditions and crash histories that indicate a potential for substantial safety and congestion impacts related to the work zone activity, and that may be mitigated by improved driver behavior and awareness of the work zone;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Work zone operations that require brief stoppage of all traffic in one or both directions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> High-speed roadways where unexpected or sudden traffic queuing is anticipated, especially if the queue forms a considerable distance in advance of the work zone or immediately adjacent to the work space; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Other work site conditions where traffic presents a high risk for workers and road users, such that the risk may be reduced by improving road user behavior and awareness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs associated with the provision of uniformed law enforcement to help protect workers and road users, and to maintain safe and efficient travel through highway work zones, are eligible for Federal-aid participation. Federal-aid eligibility excludes law enforcement activities that would normally be expected in and around highway problem areas requiring routine or ongoing law enforcement traffic control and enforcement activities. Payment for the services of uniformed law enforcement in work zones may be included in the construction contract, or be provided by direct reimbursement from the highway agency to the law enforcement agency. When payment is included through the construction contract, the contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the law enforcement agency, and in turn will recover those costs through contract pay items. Direct interagency reimbursement may be made on a project-specific basis, or on a program-wide basis that considers the overall level of services to be provided by the law enforcement agency. Contract pay items for law enforcement service may be either unit price or lump sum items. Unit price items should be utilized when the highway agency can estimate and control the quantity of law enforcement services required on the project. The use of lump sum payment should be limited to situations where the quantity of services is directly affected by the contractor's choice of project scheduling and chosen manner of staging and performing the work. Innovative payment items may also be considered when they offer an advantage to both the highway agency and the contractor. When reimbursement to the law enforcement agency is made by interagency transfer of funds, the highway agency should establish a program-level or project-level budget that is adequate to meet anticipated program or project needs, and include provisions to address unplanned needs and other contingencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Work Vehicles and Equipment. In addition to addressing risks to workers and road users from motorized traffic, the agency processes, procedures, and/or guidance established in accordance with 23 CFR 630.1006 should also address safe means for work vehicles and equipment to enter and exit traffic lanes and for delivery of construction materials to the work space, based on individual project characteristics and factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Payment for Traffic Control. Consistent with the requirements of 23 CFR 630.1012, Project-level Procedures, project plans, specifications and estimates (PS&Es;) shall include appropriate pay item provisions for implementing the project Transportation Management Plan (TMP), which includes a Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) plan, either through method or performance based specifications. Pay item provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payment for work zone traffic control features and operations shall not be incidental to the contract, or included in payment for other items of work not related to traffic control and safety;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As a minimum, separate pay items shall be provided for major categories of traffic control devices, safety features, and work zone safety activities, including but not limited to positive protection devices, and uniformed law enforcement activities when funded through the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For method based specifications, the specifications and other PS&E; documents should provide sufficient details such that the quantity and types of devices and the overall effort required to implement and maintain the TMP can be determined;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For method-based specifications, unit price pay items, lump sum pay items, or a combination thereof may be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lump sum payment should be limited to items for which an estimate of the actual quantity required is provided in the PS&E; or for items where the actual quantity required is dependent upon the contractor's choice of work scheduling and methodology;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> For Lump Sum items, a contingency provision should be included such that additional payment is provided if the quantity or nature of the required work changes, either an increase or decrease, due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Unit price payment should be provided for those items over which the contractor has little or no control over the quantity, and no firm estimate of quantities is provided in the PS&Es;, but over which the highway agency has control of the actual quantity to be required during the project;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Specifications should clearly indicate how placement, movement/relocation, and maintenance of traffic control devices and safety features will be compensated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The specifications should include provisions to require and enforce contractor compliance with the contract provisions relative to implementation and maintenance of the project TMP and related traffic control items. Enforcement provisions may include remedies such as liquidated damages, work suspensions, or withholding payment for noncompliance.</p>
