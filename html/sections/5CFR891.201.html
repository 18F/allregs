                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The original period for election by each eligible retired  employee was during the months of March and April 1961. Failure to elect  when eligible to do so is deemed an election not to participate in the  program unless the failure is determined by the retirement office to be  for cause beyond the control   of the retired employee. In any case in which annuity or compensation is  being paid to a payee in behalf of a retired employee, the payee shall  make the election for the retired employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A retired employee may elect to participate in the program  for self alone or for self and family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Survivors, if actually or constructively living in the same  household, have only one right of election among them. The election  shall be made by the payee. The fact that one payee is receiving annuity  or compensation for all members of the family is prima facie evidence  that they are living in the same household. The existence of more than  one payee is prima facie evidence that each payee and the survivors in  whose behalf the payee is receiving annuity or compensation constitute a  separate household, and each payee may elect for the survivors in whose  behalf he is receiving annuity or compensation, but where a family is  receiving annuity or compensation through more than one payee, one  payee, with the consent of the other payees, may elect for the whole  family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A retired employee may not be covered under more than one  election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A retired employee who is entitled to more than one annuity or  to compensation and annuity is entitled to only one election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each retired employee who elects to receive a Government  contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits plan shall  file with his election a certificate of the carrier, on the form  prescribed by OPM for the purpose, that he is a subscriber to a health  benefits plan. OPM, or the appropriate retirement office, at any time  may require that a retired employee renew the certificate, or may take  such other action as it considers desirable to verify the continuing  eligibility of the retired employee to receive a Government  contribution. The appropriate retirement office may suspend the  Government contribution when there is a reasonable doubt of the retired  employee's continuing eligibility to receive the Government  contribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the discretion of the retirement office, a representative of  the retired employee having a written authorization to do so may elect  for him.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A person who was not eligible, during the months of March and  April 1961, to elect to subscribe to the uniform plan or to receive a  Government contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits  plan, may apply to the appropriate retirement office when he becomes  eligible. If the retirement office determines that he is eligible, it  shall notify the retired employee that he is eligible to make an  election in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section within  60 days of the date of the notice. If the retirement office determines  that a retired employee was unable, for cause beyond his control, to  make an election within the time limits prescribed by this section, it  shall notify the retired employee that he is eligible to make an  election in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) of this section within  60 days of the date of the notice. Elections made under this paragraph  are effective, for a retired employee receiving annuity and a survivor  receiving compensation, on the first day of the third month following  the month in which the retirement office receives the election.  Withholdings and contributions are effective for months beginning on and  after the first day of the second month following the month in which the  retirement office receives the election. For any other retired employee  receiving compensation, changes of election made under this paragraph  are effective on the first day of the third 4-week period following the  4-week period in which the Bureau of Employees' Compensation receives  the election, and withholdings and contributions are effective beginning  with the second 4-week period following receipt of the election. This  paragraph does not apply to retired employees who have been, at any  time, covered by the election of another under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retired employees and survivors who, on January 1, 1973, were  enrolled for either basic coverage only or major medical coverage only  of the Uniform Plan are, effective January 1, 1973, automatically  enrolled in basic plus major medical coverage of the Uniform Plan.
