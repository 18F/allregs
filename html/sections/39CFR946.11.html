Unless the Chief Postal Inspector determines that cash or the proceeds of the sale of the abandoned property are to be shared with other law enforcement agencies, such cash or proceeds shall be deposited in the Postal Service Fund established by 39 U.S.C. 2003. The authority to make this determination may be delegated by the Chief Postal Inspector.
