                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. (1) Beneficial interest means debt or equity (or mixed) interests or obligations of any type issued by a special purpose entity that entitle their holders to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from financial assets owned by the special purpose entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beneficial interest means debt or equity (or mixed) interests or obligations of any type issued by a special purpose entity that entitle their holders to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from financial assets owned by the special purpose entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial asset means cash or a contract or instrument that conveys to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument from another entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Legal isolation means that transferred financial assets have been put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor, its creditors, a trustee in bankruptcy, or a receiver, either by a single transaction or a series of transactions taken as a whole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participation means the transfer or assignment of an undivided interest in all or part of a loan or a lease from a seller, known as the ``lead,'' to a buyer, known as the ``participant,'' without recourse to the lead, under an agreement between the lead and the participant. Without recourse means that the participation is not subject to any agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the participant's interest or to otherwise compensate the participant due to a default on the underlying obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Securitization means the pooling and repackaging by a special purpose entity of assets or other credit exposures that can be sold to investors. Securitization includes transactions that create stratified credit risk positions whose performance is dependent upon an underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans and commitments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Special purpose entity means a trust, corporation, or other entity demonstrably distinct from the federally-insured credit union that is primarily engaged in acquiring and holding (or transferring to another special purpose entity) financial assets, and in activities related or incidental thereto, in connection with the issuance by such special purpose entity (or by another special purpose entity that acquires financial assets directly or indirectly from such special purpose entity) of beneficial interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board, by exercise of its authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts under 12 U.S.C. 1787(c), will not reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the credit union or the liquidation estate any financial assets transferred to another party by a federally-insured credit union in connection with a securitization or participation, provided that a transfer meets all conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, other than the ``legal isolation'' condition addressed by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section will not apply unless the federally-insured credit union received adequate consideration for the transfer of financial assets at the time of the transfer, and the documentation effecting the transfer of financial assets reflects the intent of the parties to treat the transaction as a sale, and not as a secured borrowing, for accounting purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section will not be construed as waiving, limiting, or otherwise affecting the power of the Board, as conservator or liquidating agent, to disaffirm or repudiate any agreement imposing continuing obligations or duties upon the federally-insured credit union in conservatorship or the liquidation estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section will not be construed as waiving, limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the Board to take any action or to exercise any power not specifically limited by this section, including, but not limited to, any rights, powers or remedies of the Board regarding transfers taken in contemplation of the credit union's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the credit union or the creditors of such credit union, or that is a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Board will not seek to avoid an otherwise legally enforceable securitization agreement or participation agreement executed by a federally-insured credit union solely because such agreement does not meet the ``contemporaneous'' requirement of sections 207(b)(9) and 208(a)(3) of the Federal Credit Union Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This section may be repealed by the NCUA upon 30 days notice and opportunity for comment provided in the Federal Register, but any such repeal or amendment will not apply to any transfers of financial assets made in connection with a securitization or participation that was in effect before such repeal or modification. For purposes of this paragraph, a securitization would be in effect on the earliest date that the most senior level of beneficial interests is issued, and a participation would be in effect on the date that the parties executed the participation agreement.
