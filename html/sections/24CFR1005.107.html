                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A loan guaranteed under section 184 may be secured  by any collateral authorized under and not prohibited by Federal, state,  or tribal law and determined by the lender and approved by the  Department to be sufficient to cover the amount of the loan, and may  include, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The property and/or improvements to be acquired, constructed, or  rehabilitated, to the extent that an interest in such property is not  subject to the restrictions against alienation applicable to trust or  restricted land;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A first and/or second mortgage on property other than trust  land;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Personal property; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cash, notes, an interest in securities, royalties, annuities, or  any other property that is transferable and whose present value may be  determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Leasehold of trust or restricted land as collateral. If a  leasehold interest in trust or restricted land is used as collateral or  security for the loan, the following additional provisions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approved Lease. Any land lease for a unit financed under Section  184 must be on a form approved by both HUD and the Bureau of Indian  Affairs, U.S. Department of Interior.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assumption or sale of leasehold. The lease form must contain a  provision requiring tribal consent before any assumption of an existing  lease, except where title to the leasehold interest is obtained by the  Department through foreclosure of the guaranteed mortgage or a deed in  lieu of foreclosure. A mortgagee other than the Department must obtain  tribal consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. Tribal  consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser,  including the Department, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be  terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is  guaranteed or held by the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mortgagee or HUD shall only pursue liquidation after  offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the  Indian tribe, or the Indian housing authority servicing the Indian tribe  or the TDHE servicing the Indian tribe. The mortgagee or HUD shall not  sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except  to one of these three entities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Priority of loan obligation. Any tribal government whose courts  have jurisdiction to hear foreclosures must enact a law providing for  the satisfaction of a loan guaranteed or held by the Department before  other obligations (other than tribal leasehold taxes against the  property assessed after the property is mortgaged) are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Eviction procedures. Before HUD will guarantee a loan secured by  trust land, the tribe having jurisdiction over such property must notify  the Department that it has adopted and will enforce procedures for  eviction of defaulted mortgagors where the guaranteed loan has been  foreclosed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enforcement. If the Department determines that the tribe has  failed to enforce adequately its eviction procedures, HUD will cease  issuing guarantees for loans for tribal members except pursuant to  existing commitments. Adequate enforcement is demonstrated where prior  evictions have been completed within 60 days after the date of the  notice by HUD that foreclosure was completed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Review. If the Department ceases to issue guarantees in  accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, HUD will notify the  tribe of the reasons for such action and that the tribe may, within 30  days after notification of HUD's action, file a written appeal with the  Director, Office of Loan Guarantee (OLG), Office of Native American  Programs (ONAP). Within 30 days after notification of an adverse  decision by the OLG Director, the tribe may file a written request for  review with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for ONAP. Upon notification  of an adverse decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, the tribe has  30 additional days to file an appeal with the Assistant Secretary for  Public and Indian Housing. The determination of the Assistant Secretary  shall be final, but the tribe may resubmit the issue to the Assistant  Secretary for review at any subsequent time, if new evidence or changed  circumstances warrant reconsideration. (Any other administrative actions  determined to be necessary to debar a tribe from participating in this  program will be subject to the formal debarment procedures contained in  2 CFR part 2424.)
