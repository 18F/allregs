                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Premise. Mementos are welcome aboard Space Shuttle flights. However, they are flown as a courtesy--not as an entitlement. The Associate Administrator for Space Flight is free to make exceptions to this accommodation without explanation. Moreover, mementos are ballast not payload. They can be reduced or eliminated (by the Deputy Director, Space Shuttle Program, Johnson Space Center) for weight, volume, or other technical reasons without reference to higher authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Constraints. Mementos to be carried on Space Shuttle flights must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Space Flight and are stowed only in an OFK or a PPK. Mementos will not be carried within payload containers, including Get-Away Specials, or in any other container or locker aboard the Space Shuttle, other than within the designated OFK or PPK.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Economic Gain. Items carried in an OFK or a PPK will not be sold, transferred for sale, used or transferred for personal gain, or used or transferred for any commercial or fund-raising purpose. Items such as philatelic materials and coins that, by their nature, lend themselves to exploitation by the recipients, or create problems with respect to good taste; or that are large, bulky, or heavy items (in the context of the OFK's size, as indicated in Sec. 1214.601(b) of this part) will not be approved for flight.</p>
