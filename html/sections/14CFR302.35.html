                                Sec.  302.35  Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Time for filing. Within such period after the date of service of any tentative decision by the DOT decisionmaker as may be fixed therein, any party may file a brief addressed to the DOT decisionmaker in support of his or her exceptions to such decision or in opposition to the exceptions filed by any other party. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker on initial or recommended decisions of administrative law judges shall be filed only in those cases where the DOT decisionmaker grants discretionary review and orders further proceedings, pursuant to Sec.  302.32(d)(2), and only upon those issues specified in the order. Such briefs shall be filed within thirty (30) days after date of service of the order granting discretionary review unless otherwise specified in the order. In cases where, because of the limited number of parties and the nature of the issues, the filing of opening, answering, and reply briefs will not unduly delay the proceeding and will assist in its proper disposition, the DOT decisionmaker may direct that the parties file briefs at different times rather than at the same time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect of failure to restate objections in briefs. In determining the merits of an appeal, the DOT decisionmaker will not consider the exceptions or the petition for discretionary review but will consider only the brief. Each objection contained in the exceptions or each issue specified in the DOT decisionmaker's order exercising discretionary review must be restated and supported by a statement and adequate discussion of all matters relied upon, in a brief filed pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Formal specifications of briefs--(1) Contents. Each brief shall discuss every point of law, fact, or precedent that the party submitting it is entitled to raise and that it wishes the DOT decisionmaker to consider. Each brief shall include a summary of the argument not to exceed five (5) pages. Support and justification for every point raised shall include itemized references to the pages of the transcript of hearing, exhibit or other matter of record, and citations of the statutes, regulations, or principal authorities relied upon. If a brief or any point discussed in the brief is not in substantial conformity with the requirement for such support and justification, no motion to strike or dismiss such document shall be made but the DOT decisionmaker may disregard the points involved. Copies of

briefs may be furnished by use of electronic media in a format acceptable to the Department and the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Incorporation by reference. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker shall be completely self-contained and shall not incorporate by reference any portion of any other brief or pleading; Provided, however, That instead of submitting a brief to the DOT decisionmaker a party may adopt by reference specifically identified pages or the whole of his or her prior brief to the administrative law judge if the latter complies with all requirements of this section. In such cases, the party shall file with Department of Transportation Dockets a letter exercising this privilege and serve all parties in the same manner as a brief to the DOT decisionmaker.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Length. Except by permission or direction of the DOT decisionmaker, briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages including pages contained in any appendix, table, chart, or other document physically attached to the brief, but excluding maps and the summary of the argument. In this case ``map'' means only those pictorial representations of routes, flight paths, mileage, and similar ancillary data that are superimposed on geographic drawings and contain only such text as is needed to explain the pictorial representation.</p>
