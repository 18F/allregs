                                Sec. 1.446-6  REMIC inducement fees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section provides specific timing rules for the  clear reflection of income from an inducement fee received in connection  with becoming the holder of a noneconomic REMIC residual interest. An  inducement fee must be included in income over a period reasonably  related to the period during which the applicable REMIC is expected to  generate taxable income or net loss allocable to the holder of the  noneconomic residual interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicable REMIC. The applicable REMIC is the REMIC that issued  the noneconomic residual interest with respect to which the inducement  fee is paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inducement fee. An inducement fee is the amount paid to induce a  person to become the holder of a noneconomic residual interest in an  applicable REMIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Noneconomic residual interest. A REMIC residual interest is a  noneconomic residual interest if it is a noneconomic residual interest  within the meaning of Sec. 1.860E-1(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Remaining anticipated weighted average life. The remaining  anticipated weighted average life is the anticipated weighted average  life determined using the methodology set forth in Sec. 1.860E- 1(a)(3)(iv) applied as of the date of acquisition of the noneconomic  residual interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> REMIC. The term REMIC has the same meaning in this section as  given in Sec. 1.860D-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General rule. All taxpayers, regardless of their overall method  of accounting, must recognize an inducement fee over the remaining  expected life of the applicable REMIC in a manner that reasonably  reflects, without regard to this paragraph, the after-tax costs and  benefits of holding that noneconomic residual interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule on disposition of a residual interest. If any  portion of an inducement fee received with respect to becoming the  holder of a noneconomic residual interest in an applicable REMIC has not  been recognized in full by the holder as of the time the holder  transfers, or otherwise ceases to be the holder for Federal tax purposes  of, that residual interest in the applicable REMIC, then the holder must  include the unrecognized portion of the inducement fee in income at that  time. This rule does not apply to a transaction to which section  381(c)(4) applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>, that method complies with  the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The book method. Under the book method, an inducement fee is  recognized in accordance with the method of accounting, and over the  same period, used by the taxpayer for financial reporting purposes  (including consolidated financial statements to shareholders, partners,  beneficiaries, and other proprietors and for credit purposes), provided  that the inducement fee is included in income for financial reporting  purposes over a period that is not shorter than the period during which  the applicable REMIC is expected to generate taxable income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The modified REMIC regulatory method. Under the modified REMIC  regulatory method, the inducement fee is recognized ratably over the  remaining anticipated weighted average life of the applicable REMIC as  if the inducement fee were unrecognized gain being included in gross  income under Sec. 1.860F-2(b)(4)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Additional safe harbor methods. The Commissioner, by revenue  ruling or revenue procedure (see Sec. 1.601(d)(2) of this chapter), may  provide additional safe harbor methods for recognizing inducement fees  relating to noneconomic REMIC residual interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Method of accounting. The treatment of inducement fees is a  method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and  the regulations   thereunder apply. A taxpayer is generally permitted to adopt a method of  accounting for inducement fees that satisfies the requirements of  paragraph (c) of this section. Once a taxpayer adopts a method of  accounting for inducement fees, that method must be applied consistently  to all inducement fees received in connection with noneconomic REMIC  residual interests and may be changed only with the consent of the  Commissioner, as provided by section 446(e) and the regulations and  procedures thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section is applicable for taxable years  ending on or after May 11, 2004.  [T.D. 9128, 69 FR 26041, May 11, 2004]</p>
