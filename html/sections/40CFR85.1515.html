                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, any  motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine conditionally imported pursuant to  Sec. 85.1505 or Sec. 85.1509 and required to be emission tested shall be  tested using the FCT at 40 CFR part 86 applicable to current model year  motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines at the time of testing or  reduced testing requirements as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ICIs are eligible for reduced testing under this paragraph (a)  subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The OEM must have a valid certificate of conformity covering the  vehicle.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The vehicle must be in its original configuration as certified  by the OEM. This applies for all emission-related components, including  the electronic control module, engine calibrations, and all evaporative/ refueling control hardware. It also applies for OBD software and  hardware, including all sensors and actuators.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The vehicle modified as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of  this section must fully comply with all applicable emission standards  and requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Vehicles must have the proper OBD systems installed and  operating. When faults are present, the ICI must test and verify the  system's ability to find the faults (such as disconnected components),  set codes, and illuminate the light, and set readiness codes as  appropriate for each vehicle. When no fault is present, the ICI must  verify that after sufficient prep driving (typically one FTP test  cycle), all OBD readiness codes are set and the OBD system does not  indicate a malfunction (i.e., no codes set and no light illuminated).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The ICI may not modify more than 300 vehicles in any given model  year using reduced testing provisions in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The ICI must state in the application for certification that it  will meet all the conditions in this paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following provisions allow for ICIs to certify vehicles with  reduced testing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the test waivers specified in 40 CFR 86.1829, you  may provide a statement in the application for certification, supported  by engineering analysis, that vehicles comply with any of the following  standards that apply instead of submitting test data:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Cold temperature CO and NMHC emission standards specified in 40  CFR 86.1811.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> SFTP emission standards specified in 40 CFR 86.1811 and 86.1816  for all pollutants.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For anything other than diesel-fueled vehicles, PM emission  standards specified in 40 CFR 86.1811 and 86.1816.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any running loss, refueling, spitback, bleed emissions, and leak  standards specified in 40 CFR part 86, subparts A and S.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must perform testing and submit test data as follows to  demonstrate compliance with emission standards:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Exhaust and fuel economy tests. You must measure emissions over  the FTP driving cycle and the highway fuel economy driving cycle as  specified in 40 CFR 600.109 to meet the fuel economy requirements in 40  CFR part 600 and demonstrate compliance with the exhaust emission  standards in 40 CFR part 86 (other than PM). Measure exhaust emissions  and fuel economy with the same test procedures used by the original  manufacturer to test the vehicle for certification. However, you must  use an electric dynamometer meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.108 or   40 CFR part 1066, subpart B, unless we approve a different dynamometer  based on excessive compliance costs. If you certify based on testing  with a different dynamometer, you must state in the application for  certification that all vehicles in the emission family will comply with  emission standards if tested on an electric dynamometer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> to demonstrate compliance  with the evaporative emission standards in 40 CFR part 86 instead of the  otherwise specified procedures. Use measurement equipment for  evaporative measurements specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B, except  that the evaporative emission enclosure does not need to accommodate  varying ambient temperatures. The evaporative measurement procedure is  integral to the procedure for measuring exhaust emissions over the FTP  driving cycle as described in paragraph (a)(ii)(2)(A) of this section.  Perform canister preconditioning using the same procedure used by the  original manufacturer to certify the vehicle; perform this canister  loading before the initial preconditioning drive. Perform a diurnal  emission test at the end of the stabilization period before the exhaust  emission test by heating the fuel from 60 to 84 F, either by exposing  the vehicle to increasing ambient temperatures or by applying heat  directly to the fuel tank. Measure hot soak emissions as described in 40  CFR 86.138-96(k). We may approve alternative measurement procedures that  are equivalent to or more stringent than the specified procedures if the  specified procedures are impractical for particular vehicle models or  measurement facilities. The sum of the measured diurnal and hot soak  values must meet the appropriate emission standard as specified in this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The emission standards applicable to nonconforming light-duty  vehicles and light-duty trucks imported pursuant to this subpart are  outlined in tables 1 and 2 of this section, respectively. The useful  life as specified in tables 1 and 2 of this section is applicable to  imported light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nonconforming motor vehicles or motor vehicle engines of 1994  OP year and later conditionally imported pursuant to Sec. 85.1505 or  Sec. 85.1509 shall meet all of the emission standards specified in 40  CFR part 86 for the OP year of the vehicle or motor vehicle engine.

For 2004 OP year HLDTs  and MDPVs where modifications commence on the first vehicle of a test  group before December 21, 2003, this requirement does not apply to the  2004 OP year. ICIs opting to bring all of their 2004 OP year HLDTs and  MDPVs into compliance with the exhaust emission standards of bin 10 in  Tables S04-1 and S04-2 in 40 CFR 86.1811-04, may use the optional higher  NMOG values for their 2004-2006 OP year LDT2s and 2004-2008 LDT4s.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nonconforming LDT3s and LDT4s (HLDTs) and medium-duty  passenger vehicles (MDPVs) originally manufactured in OP years 2007 and  2008 must meet the FTP exhaust emission standards of bin 8 in Tables  S04-1 and S04-2 in 40 CFR 86.1811-04 and the applicable evaporative  standards specified in 40 CFR 86.1811-04(e)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Nonconforming LDV/LLDTs originally manufactured in OP years  2007 through 2021 and nonconforming HLDTs and MDPVs originally  manufactured in OP year 2009 through 2021 must meet the FTP exhaust  emission standards of bin 5 in Tables S04-1 and   S04-2 in 40 CFR 86.1811-04, and the evaporative standards specified in  40 CFR 86.1811-04(e)(1) through (4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> ICIs are exempt from the Tier 2 and the interim non-Tier2 phase- in intermediate percentage requirements for exhaust, evaporative, and  refueling emissions described in 40 CFR 86.1811-04.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In cases where multiple standards exist in a given model year  in 40 CFR part 86 due to phase-in requirements of new standards, the  applicable standards for motor vehicle engines required to be certified  to engine-based standards are the least stringent standards applicable  to the engine type for the OP year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Nonconforming LDV/LLDTs originally manufactured in OP years  2009 through 2021 must meet the evaporative emission standards in Table  S09-1 in 40 CFR 86.1811-09(e).
