You are not actively  pursuing a final OCC determination if you have failed to timely take an  action required under this part, including filing required additional  information, or the OCC has suspended processing of your application  under Sec. 116.260 based on circumstances that are, in whole or in part,  within your control and you have failed to take reasonable steps to  resolve these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">PARTS 117	127 [RESERVED]</p>
