                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A transfer certificate is a certificate permitting the transfer of property of a nonresident decedent without liability. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no domestic corporation or its transfer agent should transfer stock registered in the name of a non-resident decedent (regardless of citizenship) except such shares which have been submitted for transfer by a duly qualified executor or administrator who has been appointed and is acting in the United States, without first requiring a transfer certificate covering all of the decedent's stock of the corporation and showing that the transfer may be made without liability. Corporations, transfer agents of domestic corporations, transfer agents of foreign corporations (except

as to shares held in the name of a nonresident decedent not a citizen of the United States), banks, trust companies, or other custodians in actual or constructive possession of property, of such a decedent can insure avoidance of liability for taxes and penalties only by demanding and receiving transfer certificates before transfer of property of nonresident decedents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States dying on or after January 1, 1977, a transfer certificate is not required with respect to the transfer of any property of the decedent if the value on the date of death of that part of the decedent's gross estate situated in the United States did not exceed the lesser of $60,000 or $60,000 reduced by the adjustments, if any, required by section 6018(a)(4) for certain taxable gifts made by the decedent and for the aggregate amount of certain specific exemptions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a nonresident not a citizen of the United States dying on or after November 14, 1966, a transfer certificate is not required with respect to the transfer before June 24, 1981 of any property of the decedent if the value on the date of death of that part of the decedent's gross estate situated in the United States did not exceed $30,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> If the transfer of the estate is subject to the tax imposed by section 2107(a) (relating to expatriation to avoid tax), any amounts which are includible in the decedent's gross estate under section 2107(b) must be added to the date of death value of the decedent's gross estate situated in the United States to determine the value on the date of death of the decedent's gross estate for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the transfer of the estate is subject to the tax imposed by section 2107(a) (relating to expatriation to avoid tax), any amounts which are includible in the decedent's gross estate under section 2107(b) must be added to the date of death value of the decedent's gross estate situated in the United States to determine the value on the date of death of the decedent's gross estate for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the transfer of the estate is subject to tax pursuant to a Presidential proclamation made under section 2108(a) (relating to Presidential proclamations of the application of pre-1967 estate tax provisions), a transfer certificate is not required with respect to the transfer of any property of the decedent if the value on the date of death of that part of the decedent's gross estate situated in the United States did not exceed $2,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A corporation, transfer agent, bank, trust company, or other custodian will not incur liability for a transfer of the decedent's property without a transfer certificate if the corporation or other person, having no information to the contrary, first receives from the executor or other responsible person, who may be reasonably regarded as in possession of the pertinent facts, a statement of the facts relating to the estate showing that the sum of the value on the date of the decedent's death of that part of his gross estate situated in the United States, and, if applicable, any amounts includible in his gross estate under section 2107(b), is such an amount that, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section, a transfer certificate is not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For the determination of the gross estate situated in the United States, see Sec. Sec. 20.2103-1 and 20.2104-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A transfer certificate will be issued by the service center director or the district director when he is satisfied that the tax imposed upon the estate, if any, has been fully discharged or provided for. The tax will be considered fully discharged for purposes of the issuance of a transfer certificate only when investigation has been completed and payment of the tax, including any deficiency finally determined, has been made. If the tax liability has not been fully discharged, transfer certificates may be issued permitting the transfer of particular items of property without liability upon the filing with the district director of such security as he may require. No transfer certificate is required in an estate of a resident decedent. Further, in the case of an estate of a nonresident decedent (regardless of citizenship) a transfer certificate is not required with respect to property which is being administered by an executor or administrator appointed, qualified, and acting within the United States. For additional regulations under section 6325, see Sec. 301.6325-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
