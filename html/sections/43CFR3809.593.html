                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You remain responsible for obligations or conditions created while  you conducted operations unless a transferee accepts responsibility  under Sec. 3809.116, and BLM accepts an adequate replacement financial  guarantee. Therefore, your financial guarantee must remain in effect  until BLM determines that you are no longer responsible for all or part  of the operation. BLM can release your financial guarantee on an  incremental basis. The new operator must provide a financial guarantee  before BLM will allow the new operator to conduct operations.</p>
