                            <p class="depth0">We are required to give you a written notice of our proposed action  before increasing, reducing, or terminating your subsidy. We will not  give this advance notice where we have factual information confirming  your death, such as through a report by your surviving spouse, a legal  guardian, a close relative, or a landlord. The notice will tell you the  first month that we plan to make the change. The notice will also give  you appeal rights which are explained in detail in Secs. 418.3601  through 418.3670. Your appeal rights for a reduction or termination will  include the right to continue to receive your subsidy at the previously  established level until there is a decision on your appeal request if  your appeal is filed within 10 days after you receive our notice. You  will not be required to pay back any subsidy you received while your  appeal was pending.</p>
