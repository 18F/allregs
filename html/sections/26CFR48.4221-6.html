                                Sec. 48.4221-6  Tax-free sales of articles to nonprofit educational
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(5)</em> and this section, to a nonprofit educational organization for  its exclusive use. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of  the term ``nonprofit educational organization''. An article may be sold  tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases  where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a  nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly,  no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit  educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known  at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so  resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(D), and paragraph (b)(4) of Sec.  48.6416(b)-2, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax  is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a  nonprofit educational organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(A)(ii)</em> describes an ``educational organization'' as  one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and  normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in  attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly  carried on. The term also includes a school operated as an activity of  an organization described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from  income tax under section 501(a), provided the primary function of such  school is the presentation of formal instruction and provided such  school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally  has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the  place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evidence required in support of tax-free sales to nonprofit  educational organizations. Every nonprofit educational organization  purchasing tax free under section 4221(a)(5) must furnish the following  information to the seller:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being  purchased, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Its registration number, and the district director's office that  issued the registration number.  Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase  order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in  connection with each sale ``except that a single notification containing  the information described in this paragraph may cover all sales by the  seller to the purchaser made during a designated period not to exceed 12  successive calendar quarters.''. See paragraph (c) of Sec. 48.4221-1  for the evidence required to establish exemption.
