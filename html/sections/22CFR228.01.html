                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part, the following terms shall have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth0">Advanced developing countries mean those countries that are categorized by the World Bank as upper middle income countries according to their gross national income per capita, except for those countries in which USAID provides assistance. USAID will maintain a list of advanced developing countries primarily based on the most recent World Bank determinations, and will make the list available in USAID's Automated Directives System, ADS 310.

If applicable, the commodity must also be able to be serviced, and, if warrantied, have a valid warranty. For services, available for purchase means the service is offered from a vendor which has complied with nationality and foreign government-owned organization requirements of this regulation, and is otherwise organized in a country in the authorized principal geographic code designated in an implementing instrument. This definition does not apply to procurements under the geographic Code 935, see Sec. 228.03 of this part, because that geographic code is for any country or area except for prohibited source countries.</p><p class="depth0">Commission means any payment or allowance by a supplier to any person for the contribution which that person has made to secure the sale or contract for the supplier or which that person makes to securing on a continuing basis similar sales or contracts for the supplier.</p><p class="depth0">Commodities or goods means any material, article, supply, good, or equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Commodity-related services means delivery services and/or incidental services.</p><p class="depth0">Cooperating country or recipient country means the country receiving the USAID assistance subject to this part 228, and includes all the countries receiving assistance under a regional program or project.</p><p class="depth0">Delivery means the transfer to, or for the account of, an importer of the right to possession of a commodity, or, with respect to a commodity-related service, the rendering to, or for the account of, an importer of any such service.</p><p class="depth0">Delivery service means any service customarily performed in a commercial export or import transaction which is necessary to affect a physical transfer of commodities to the cooperating/recipient country. Examples of such services are the following: export packing, local drayage in the source country (including waiting time at the dock), ocean and other freight, loading, heavy lift, wharfage, tollage, switching, dumping and trimming, lighterage, insurance, commodity inspection services, and services of a freight forwarder. ``Delivery service'' may also include work and materials necessary to meet USAID marking requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Developing countries means those countries that are categorized by the World Bank as low or lower middle income economies according to their gross national income per capita, and also includes all countries to which USAID provides assistance. USAID will maintain a list of developing countries primarily based on the most recent World Bank determinations, and will make the list available in USAID's Automated Directives System, ADS 310.</p><p class="depth0">Free Port or Bonded Warehouse is a special customs area with favorable customs regulations (or no customs duties and controls for transshipment).</p><p class="depth0">Implementing instrument means a binding relationship established between USAID and an outside party or parties to carry out USAID programs, by authorizing the use of USAID funds and/or nonfinancial resources for the procurement of services or commodities and/or commodity related services.
