                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determining duration of classification for information originally classified under the Order--(1) Establishing duration of classification. Except for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, an original classification authority shall follow the sequence listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section when determining the duration of classification for information originally classified under this Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establishing duration of classification. Except for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, an original classification authority shall follow the sequence listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section when determining the duration of classification for information originally classified under this Order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The original classification authority shall attempt to determine a date or event that is less than 10 years from the date of original classification and which coincides with the lapse of the information's national security sensitivity, and shall assign such date or event as the declassification instruction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If unable to determine a date or event of less than 10 years, the original classification authority shall ordinarily assign a declassification date that is 10 years from the date of the original classification decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If unable to determine a date or event of 10 years, the original classification authority shall assign a declassification date not to exceed 25 years from the date of the original classification decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duration of classification of special categories of information. The only exceptions to the sequence in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an original classification authority is classifying information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, the duration shall be up to 75 years and shall be designated with the following marking, ``50X1-HUM;'' or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an original classification authority is classifying information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the duration shall be up to 75 years and shall be designated with the following marking, ``50X2-WMD.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extending duration of classification for information classified under the Order. Extensions of classification are not automatic. If an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information does not extend the classification of information assigned a date or event for declassification, the information is automatically declassified upon the occurrence of the date or event.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has not passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may extend the classification duration of such information for a period not to exceed 25 years from the date of origin of the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may reclassify the information in accordance with the Order and this Directive only if it meets the standards for classification under sections 1.1 and 1.5 of the Order as well as section 3.3 of the Order, if appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In all cases, when extending the duration of classification, the original classification authority must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that the information continues to meet the standards for classification under the Order; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make reasonable attempts to notify all known holders of the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of information classified under prior orders--(1) Specific date or event. Unless declassified earlier, information marked with a specific date or event for declassification under a prior order is automatically declassified upon that date or event. If the specific date or event has not passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may extend the duration in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may only reclassify information in accordance with

the standards and procedures under the Order and this Directive. If the information is contained in records determined to be permanently valuable, and the prescribed date or event will take place more than 25 years from the date of origin of the document, the declassification of the information will instead be subject to section 3.3 of the Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specific date or event. Unless declassified earlier, information marked with a specific date or event for declassification under a prior order is automatically declassified upon that date or event. If the specific date or event has not passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may extend the duration in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the date or event assigned by the original classification authority has passed, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may only reclassify information in accordance with

the standards and procedures under the Order and this Directive. If the information is contained in records determined to be permanently valuable, and the prescribed date or event will take place more than 25 years from the date of origin of the document, the declassification of the information will instead be subject to section 3.3 of the Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indefinite duration of classification. For information marked with X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, or X8; ``Originating Agency's Determination Required'' or its acronym ``OADR,'' ``Manual Review'' or its acronym ``MR;'' ``DCI Only;'' ``DNI Only;'' and any other marking indicating an indefinite duration of classification under a prior order; or in those cases where a document is missing a required declassification instruction or the instruction is not complete:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A declassification authority, as defined in section 3.1(b) of the Order, may declassify it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may re-mark the information to establish a duration of classification of no more than 25 years from the date of origin of the document, consistent with the requirements for information originally classified under the Order, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unless declassified earlier, such information contained in records determined to be permanently valuable shall remain classified for 25 years from the date of its origin, at which time it will be subject to section 3.3 of the Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Release of imagery acquired by space-based intelligence reconnaissance systems. The duration of classification of imagery as defined in E.O. 12951, Release of Imagery Acquired by Space-Based Intelligence Reconnaissance Systems, that is otherwise marked with an indefinite duration, such as ``DCI Only'' or ``DNI Only,'' shall be established by the Director of National Intelligence in accordance with E.O. 12951 and consistent with E.O. 13526. Any such information shall be remarked in accordance with instructions prescribed by the Director of National Intelligence.</p>
