                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Election requirements. As a prerequisite to the nonrecognition of gain on the sale or loss of a vessel (or of a part interest therein) for Federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer, after establishing a construction reserve fund, must make an election with respect to such vessel or interest in the manner set forth in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the election must be made in the taxpayer's Federal income tax return (or, in the case of a partnership, in the partnership return of income) for the taxable year in which the gain with respect to the sale or loss of the vessel is realized. The election as to the nonrecognition of gain shall be shown by a statement to that effect, submitted as a part of, and attached to, the return. The statement, which need not be on any prescribed form, shall set forth a computation of the amount of the realized gain, the identity of the vessel, the nature and extent of the taxpayer's interest therein, whether such vessel was sold or lost and the date of sale or loss, the full sale price or full amount of indemnity, and the amount and date of each payment thereof, the basis of tax purposes and any other data affecting the determination of the realized gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain Government payments. In case a vessel is purchased or requisitioned by the United States, or is lost, in any taxable year and the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable year, the taxpayer shall make his election by filing notice thereof with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC, 20224, prior to the expiration of 60 days after receipt of the payment or indemnity. The taxpayer shall file a copy of the notice with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC, 20590. The form of the notice of election shall be prepared by the taxpayer and shall be substantially as follows:</p><p class="depth3">Election Relative to Nonrecognition of Gain Under Section 511(c)(2),</p><p class="depth3">Merchant Marine Act, 1936</p><p class="depth3">Pursuant to the provisions of section 511(c)(2) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, notice is hereby given that the undersigned taxpayer elects that gain in respect of the sale to the United States, or indemnification received from the United States on account of the loss, of the vessel named below or share therein shall not be recognized.
