Any other party may, within 10 days after  service of the motion, which time may be extended for an additional 10  days for good cause shown, serve opposing affidavits or brief or  countermove for summary decision. The presiding officer may set the  matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs if not  submitted by the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The presiding officer will grant the motion if the objections,  requests for hearing, other pleadings, affidavits, and other material  filed in connection with the hearing, or matters officially noticed,  show that there is no genuine disagreement as to any material fact  bearing on the issue and that a party is entitled to summary decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Affidavits should set forth facts that would be admissible in  evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify  to the matters stated. When a properly supported motion for summary  decision is made, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon mere  allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and  contentions; affidavits or other responses must demonstrate specifically  that there is a genuine issue of material fact for the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the  motion that for sound reasons stated, facts essential to justify the  opposition cannot be presented by affidavit, the presiding officer may  deny the motion for summary decision, order a continuance to permit  affidavits or additional evidence to be obtained, or issue other just  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a summary decision is not rendered upon all issues or for all  the relief asked, and evidentiary facts need to be developed, the  presiding officer will issue an order specifying the facts that appear  without substantial controversy and directing further evidentiary  proceedings. The facts so specified will be deemed established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A party may obtain interlocutory review by the Administrator of  a summary decision of the presiding officer.</p>
