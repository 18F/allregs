                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BOP pressure tests. When you pressure test the BOP system you  must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each  component. You must conduct the low-pressure test before the high- pressure test. For purposes of this section, BOP system components  include ram-type BOP's, related control equipment, choke and kill lines,  and valves, manifolds, strippers, and safety valves. Surface BOP systems  must be pressure tested with water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Low pressure tests. All BOP system components must be  successfully tested to a low pressure between 200 and 300 psi. Any  initial pressure equal to or greater than 300 psi must be bled back to a  pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the  initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero before  starting the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> High pressure tests. All BOP system components must be  successfully tested to the rated working pressure of the BOP equipment,  or as otherwise approved by the District Manager. The annular-type BOP  must be successfully tested at 70 percent of its rated working pressure  or as otherwise approved by the District Manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other testing requirements. Variable bore pipe rams must be  pressure tested against the largest and smallest sizes of tubulars in  use (jointed pipe, seamless pipe) in the well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Times. The BOP systems shall be tested at the following times:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When installed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least every 7 days, alternating between control stations and  at staggered intervals to allow each crew to operate the equipment. If  either control system is not functional, further operations shall be  suspended until the nonfunctional, system is operable. The test every 7  days is not required for blind or blind-shear rams. The blind or blind- shear rams shall be tested at least once every 30 days during operation.  A longer period between blowout preventer tests is allowed when there is  a stuck pipe or pressure-control operation and remedial efforts are  being performed. The tests shall be conducted as soon as possible and  before normal operations resume. The reason for postponing testing shall  be entered into the operations log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following repairs that require disconnecting a pressure seal in  the assembly, the affected seal will be pressure tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Drills. All personnel engaged in well-workover operations shall  participate in a weekly BOP drill to familiarize crew members with  appropriate safety measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stump tests. You may conduct a stump test for the BOP system on  location. A plan describing the stump test procedures must be included  in your Form BSEE-0124, Application for Permit to Modify, and must be  approved by the District Manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Coiled tubing tests. You must test the coiled tubing connector  to a low pressure of 200 to 300 psi, followed by a high pressure test to  the rated working pressure of the connector or the expected surface  pressure, whichever is less. You must successfully pressure test the  dual check valves to the rated working pressure of the connector, the  rated working pressure of the dual check valve, expected surface  pressure, or the collapse pressure of the coiled tubing, whichever is  less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recordings. You must record test pressures during BOP and coiled  tubing tests on a pressure chart, or with a digital recorder, unless  otherwise approved by the District Manager. The test interval for each  BOP system component must be 5 minutes, except for coiled tubing  operations, which must include a 10 minute high-pressure test for the  coiled tubing string. Your representative at the facility must certify  that the charts are correct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Operations log. The time, date, and results of all pressure  tests, actuations, inspections, and crew drills of the BOP system,  system components, and marine risers shall be recorded in the operations  log. The BOP tests shall be documented in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The documentation shall indicate the sequential order of BOP and  auxiliary equipment testing and the pressure and duration of each test.  As an alternate, the documentation in the operations log may reference a  BOP test plan that contains the required information and is retained on  file at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The control station used during the test shall be identified in  the operations log. For a subsea system, the pod used during the test  shall be identified in the operations log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any problems or irregularities observed during BOP and auxiliary  equipment testing and any actions taken to remedy such problems or  irregularities shall be noted in the operations log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documentation required to be entered in the operation log may  instead be referenced in the operations log. All records including  pressure charts, operations log, and referenced documents pertaining to  BOP tests, actuations, and inspections, shall be available for BSEE  review at the facility for the duration of well-workover activity.  Following completion of the well-workover activity, all such records  shall be retained for a period of 2 years at the facility, at the  lessee's filed office nearest the OCS facility, or at another location  conveniently available to the District Manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Stump test a subsea BOP system before installation. You must use  water to conduct this test. You may use drilling or completion fluids to  conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system. You must perform the  initial subsea BOP test on the seafloor within 30 days of the stump  test. You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack  during the stump test. Each ROV must be fully compatible with the BOP  stack ROV intervention panels. You must also test and verify closure of  at least one set of rams during the initial test on the seafloor through  an ROV hot stab. You must submit test procedures, including how you will  test each ROV function, with your APM for BSEE District Manager  approval. You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are  capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams, one set of  blind-shear rams, and unlatching the LMRP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the appropriate BSEE District Manager a minimum of 72  hours prior to the stump test and initial test on the seafloor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Document all your test results and make them available to BSEE  upon request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP  stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system and  verify closure of at least one set of blind-shear rams during the  initial test on the seafloor. When you conduct the initial deadman  system test on the seafloor you must ensure the well is secure and, if  hydrocarbons have been present, appropriate barriers are in place to  isolate hydrocarbons from the wellhead. You must also have an ROV on  bottom during the test. You must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit test procedures with your APM for BSEE District Manager  approval. The procedures for these function tests must include  documentation of the controls and circuitry of the system utilized  during each test. The procedure must also describe how the ROV will be  utilized during this operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Document the results of each test and make them available to  BSEE upon request.
