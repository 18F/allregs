construction prescribed in Sec. 179.5, including an alteration prescribed in Sec. 179.6, or conversion.</p><p class="depth0">Objectively reasonable and articulable belief means a belief based on particularized and identifiable facts that provide an objective basis to believe or suspect that a tank car or a class or design of tank cars may be in an unsafe operating condition.</p><p class="depth0">Qualification, as relevant to a tank car, means the car and its components conforms to the specification to which it was designed, manufactured, or modified to the requirements of this subpart, to the applicable requirements of the AAR Tank Car Manual (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), and to the owner's acceptance criteria. Qualification is accomplished by careful and critical examination that verifies conformance using inspections and tests based on a written program approved by the tank car owner followed by a written representation of that conformance. A tank car that passes the appropriate tests for its specification, has a signed test report, is marked to denote this passage, and is considered qualified for hazardous materials transportation under this subchapter.
