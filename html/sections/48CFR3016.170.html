Contract type  and fee structure should be commensurate with the work to be performed  and the risks assumed. Worthwhile existing guidance on contract type  selection, pricing, and fee structures, such as exists in Vol. I, Ch. 4  of the Contract Reference Pricing Guides [http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/ cpf/docs/contract--pricing--finance--guide/vol4--ch1.pdf] can be  consulted to determine the appropriate contract type and fee structure  for use in varied contracts with lead system integrators in the  production, fielding and sustainment of complex systems.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 3016.2_Fixed-Price Contracts</p>
