                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General--(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the protection of employees from the hazards associated with moving machinery parts of farm field equipment, farmstead equipment, and cotton gins used in any agricultural operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the protection of employees from the hazards associated with moving machinery parts of farm field equipment, farmstead equipment, and cotton gins used in any agricultural operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scope. Paragraph (a) of this section contains general requirements which apply to all covered equipment. In addition, paragraph (b) of this section applies to farm field equipment, paragraph (c) of this section applies to farmstead equipment, and paragraph (d) of this section applies to cotton gins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application. This section applies to all farm field equipment, farmstead equipment, and cotton gins, except that paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4)(ii)(A), and (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii)(A) do not apply to equipment manufactured before October 25, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. This section takes effect on October 25, 1976, except that paragraph (d) of this section is effective on June 30, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Definitions--Cotton gins are systems of machines which condition seed cotton, separate lint from seed, convey materials, and package lint cotton.</p><p class="depth0">Farm field equipment means tractors or implements, including self-propelled implements, or any combination thereof used in agricultural operations.</p><p class="depth0">Farmstead equipment means agricultural equipment normally used in a stationary manner. This includes, but is not limited to, materials handling equipment and accessories for such equipment whether or not the equipment is an integral part of a building.</p><p class="depth0">Ground driven components are components which are powered by the turning motion of a wheel as the equipment travels over the ground.</p><p class="depth0">A guard or shield is a barrier designed to protect against employee contact with a hazard created by a moving machinery part.</p><p class="depth0">Power take-off shafts are the shafts and knuckles between the tractor, or other power source, and the first gear set, pulley, sprocket, or other components on power take-off shaft driven equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Operating instructions. At the time of initial assignment and at least annually thereafter, the employer shall instruct every employee in the safe operation and servicing of all covered equipment with which he is or will be involved, including at least the following safe operating practices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Keep all guards in place when the machine is in operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permit no riders on farm field equipment other than persons required for instruction or assistance in machine operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stop engine, disconnect the power source, and wait for all machine movement to stop before servicing, adjusting, cleaning, or unclogging the equipment, except where the machine must be running to be properly serviced or maintained, in which case the employer shall instruct employees as to all steps and procedures which are necessary to safely service or maintain the equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Make sure everyone is clear of machinery before starting the engine, engaging power, or operating the machine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Lock out electrical power before performing maintenance or service on farmstead equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Methods of guarding. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, each employer shall protect employees from coming into contact with hazards created by moving machinery parts as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Through the installation and use of a guard or shield or guarding by location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever a guard or shield or guarding by location is infeasible, by using a guardrail or fence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Strength and design of guards. (i) Where guards are used to provide the protection required by this section, they shall be designed and located to protect against inadvertent contact with the hazard being guarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where guards are used to provide the protection required by this section, they shall be designed and located to protect against inadvertent contact with the hazard being guarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unless otherwise specified, each guard and its supports shall be capable of withstanding the force that a 250

pound individual, leaning on or falling against the guard, would exert upon that guard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Guards shall be free from burrs, sharp edges, and sharp corners, and shall be securely fastened to the equipment or building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Guarding by location. A component is guarded by location during operation, maintenance, or servicing when, because of its location, no employee can inadvertently come in contact with the hazard during such operation, maintenance, or servicing. Where the employer can show that any exposure to hazards results from employee conduct which constitutes an isolated and unforeseeable event, the component shall also be considered guarded by location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Guarding by railings. Guardrails or fences shall be capable of protecting against employees inadvertently entering the hazardous area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Servicing and maintenance. Whenever a moving machinery part presents a hazard during servicing or maintenance, the engine shall be stopped, the power source disconnected, and all machine movement stopped before servicing or maintenance is performed, except where the employer can establish that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The equipment must be running to be properly serviced or maintained;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The equipment cannot be serviced or maintained while a guard or guards otherwise required by this standard are in place; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The servicing or maintenance can be safely performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Farm field equipment--(1) Power take-off guarding.

The master shield shall have sufficient strength to prevent permanent deformation of the shield when a 250 pound operator mounts or dismounts the tractor using the shield as a step.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Power take-off driven equipment shall be guarded to protect against employee contact with positively driven rotating members of the power drive system. Where power take-off driven equipment is of a design requiring removal of the tractor master shield, the equipment shall also include protection from that portion of the tractor power take-off shaft which protrudes from the tractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Signs shall be placed at prominent locations on tractors and power take-off driven equipment specifying that power drive system safety shields must be kept in place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other power transmission components. (i) The mesh or nip-points of all power driven gears, belts, chains, sheaves, pulleys, sprockets, and idlers shall be guarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The mesh or nip-points of all power driven gears, belts, chains, sheaves, pulleys, sprockets, and idlers shall be guarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All revolving shafts, including projections such as bolts, keys, or set screws, shall be guarded, except smooth shaft ends protruding less than one-half the outside diameter of the shaft and its locking means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ground driven components shall be guarded in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section if any employee may be exposed to them while the drives are in motion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Functional components.
