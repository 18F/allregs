                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standards. TSA determines that an applicant poses a security threat warranting denial of an HME or TWIC, if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant has a disqualifying criminal offense described in 49 CFR 1572.103;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The applicant does not meet the immigration status requirements described in 49 CFR 1572.105;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TSA conducts the analyses described in 49 CFR 1572.107 and determines that the applicant poses a security threat; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The applicant has been adjudicated as lacking mental capacity or committed to a mental health facility, as described in 49 CFR 1572.109.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Immediate Revocation/Invalidation. TSA may invalidate a TWIC or direct a State to revoke an HME immediately, if TSA determines during the security threat assessment that an applicant poses an immediate threat to transportation security, national security, or of terrorism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Violation of FMCSA Standards. The regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) provide that an applicant is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for specified periods, if he or she has an offense that is listed in the FMCSA rules at 49 CFR 383.51. If records indicate that an applicant has committed an offense that would disqualify the applicant from operating a commercial motor vehicle under 49 CFR 383.51, TSA will not issue a Determination of No Security Threat until the State or the FMCSA determine that the applicant is not disqualified under that section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver. In accordance with the requirements of Sec.  1515.7, applicants may apply for a waiver of certain security threat assessment standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Comparability of Other Security Threat Assessment Standards. TSA may determine that security threat assessments conducted by other governmental agencies are comparable to the threat assessment described in this part, which TSA conducts for HME and TWIC applicants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In making a comparability determination, TSA will consider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The minimum standards used for the security threat assessment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The frequency of the threat assessment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date of the most recent threat assessment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the threat assessment includes biometric identification and a biometric credential.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To apply for a comparability determination, the agency seeking the determination must contact the Assistant Program Manager, Attn: Federal Agency Comparability Check, Hazmat

Threat Assessment Program, Transportation Security Administration, 601 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6019.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TSA will notify the public when a comparability determination is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An applicant, who has completed a security threat assessment that is determined to be comparable under this section to the threat assessment described in this part, must complete the enrollment process and provide biometric information to obtain a TWIC, if the applicant seeks unescorted access to a secure area of a vessel or facility. The applicant must pay the fee listed in 49 CFR 1572.503 for information collection/credential issuance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> TSA has determined that the security threat assessment for an HME under this part is comparable to the security threat assessment for TWIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> TSA has determined that the security threat assessment for a FAST card, under the Free and Secure Trade program administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is comparable to the security threat assessment described in this part.
