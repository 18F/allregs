                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For each engine family, HC+NOX [NMHC+NOX]  certification emission credits (positive or negative) are to be  calculated according to the following equation and rounded to the  nearest gram. Consistent units are to be used throughout the equation.  Credits = Productionx(Standard--FEL)xPowerxUseful lifexLoad Factor  Where:  Production = eligible production as defined in this part. Annual</p><p class="depth0">production projections are used to project credit availability</p><p class="depth0">for initial certification. Eligible production volume is used</p><p class="depth0">in determining actual credits for end-of-year compliance</p><p class="depth0">determination. Standard = the current and applicable Small SI engine HC+NOX</p><p class="depth0"><em>(NMHC+NOX)</em> emission standard in grams per kilowatt</p><p class="depth0">hour as determined in Sec. 90.103 or, for early credits, the</p><p class="depth0">applicable emission level as specified in Sec. 90.205(b). FEL = the family emission limit for the engine family in grams per</p><p class="depth0">kilowatt hour. Power = the maximum modal power of the certification test engine, in</p><p class="depth0">kilowatts, as</p><p class="depth0">calculated from the applicable federal test procedure as</p><p class="depth0">described in this part. Useful Life = the useful life in hours corresponding to the useful life</p><p class="depth0">category for which the engine family was certified. Load Factor = 47 percent (i.e., 0.47) for Test Cycle A and Test Cycle B,</p><p class="depth0">and 85 percent (i.e., 0.85) for Test Cycle C. For approved</p><p class="depth0">alternate test procedures, the load factor must be calculated</p><p class="depth0">according to the following formula:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth0">Where:  %MTT modei = percent of the maximum FTP torque for mode i. %MTS modei = percent of the maximum FTP engine rotational</p><p class="depth0">speed for mode i. WF modei = the weighting factor for mode i.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manufacturer compliance with the emission standards is  determined on a corporate average basis at the end of each model year. A  manufacturer is in compliance when the sum of positive and negative  emission credits it holds is greater than or equal to zero, except that  the sum of positive and negative credits may be less than zero as  allowed under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If, as a result of production line testing as required in  subpart H of this part, an engine family is determined to be in  noncompliance pursuant to Sec. 90.710, the manufacturer may raise its  FEL for past and future production as necessary. Further, a manufacturer  may carry a negative credit balance (known also as a credit deficit) for  the subject class and model year and for the next three model years. The  credit deficit may be no larger than that created by the nonconforming  family. If the credit deficit still exists after the model year  following the model year in which the nonconformity occurred, the  manufacturer must obtain and apply credits to offset the remaining  credit deficit at a rate of 1.2 grams for each gram of deficit within  the next two model years. The provisions of this paragraph are subject  to the limitations in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For model years 2004 through 2007, an engine manufacturer who  certifies at least one Class V engine family in a given model year may  carry forward a credit deficit for four model years, but must not carry  such deficit into the fifth year, provided the deficit is attributable  to negative credits from its Class V engine families, subject to the  following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Credit deficits are permitted for model years 2004 through 2007  but cannot occur for more than two consecutive model years for a given  manufacturer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If an engine manufacturer calculates that it has a credit  deficit for a given model year, it must obtain sufficient credits from  engine families produced by itself or another manufacturer in a model  year no later than the fourth model year following the model year for  which it calculated the credit deficit. (Example: if a manufacturer  calculates that it has a credit deficit for the 2004 model year, it must  obtain sufficient credits to offset that deficit from its own production  or that of other manufacturers' 2008 or earlier model year engine  families.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An engine manufacturer carrying the deficit into the first model  year following the year in which it was generated must generate or  obtain credits to offset that deficit and apply them to the deficit at a  rate of 1:1. An engine manufacturer carrying the deficit into the second  and third model years must generate or obtain credits to offset that  deficit and apply them to the deficit at a rate of 1.1:1 (i.e., deficits  carried into the second and third model year must be repaid with credits  equal to 110 percent of the deficit). Deficits carried into the fourth  model year must be offset by credits at a rate of 1.2:1 (i.e., 120  percent of the deficit);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An engine manufacturer who has a credit deficit may use  credits from any class of spark-ignition nonroad engines at or below 19  kilowatts generated or obtained through averaging,   banking or trading to offset the credit deficit; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An engine manufacturer must not bank credits for future use or  trade credits to another engine manufacturer during a model year in  which it has generated a deficit or into which it has carried a deficit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Regulations elsewhere in this part notwithstanding, if an engine  manufacturer experiences two or more production line testing failures  pursuant to the regulations in subpart H of this part in a given model  year, the manufacturer may raise the FEL of previously produced engines  only to the extent that such engines represent no more than 10 percent  of the manufacturer's total eligible production for that model year, as  determined on the date when the FEL is adjusted. For any additional  engine families determined to be in noncompliance, the manufacturer must  conduct offsetting projects approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If, as a result of production line testing under this subpart, a  manufacturer desires to lower its FEL it may do so subject to  Sec. 90.708(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Except as allowed at paragraph (c) of this section, when a  manufacturer is not in compliance with the applicable emission standard  by the date 270 days after the end of the model year, considering all  credit calculations and transactions completed by then, the manufacturer  will be in violation of the regulations in this part and EPA may,  pursuant to Sec. 90.123, void ab initio the certificates of engine  families for which the manufacturer has not obtained sufficient positive  emission credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Credit deficits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers must offset any deficits for  a given model year by the reporting deadline for the fourth model year  following the model year in which the deficits were generated as  required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Manufacturers may offset  deficits by generating credits or acquiring credits generated by another  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section within the required timeframe for offsetting deficits will be  considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the  certificate(s) was issued and the individual noncomplying engines not  covered by the certificate must be determined according to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If deficits are not offset within the specified time period,  the number of engines which could not be covered in the calculation to  show compliance with the fleet average HC+NOX standard in the  model year in which the deficit occurred and thus are not covered by the  certificate must be calculated using the methodology described in  paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> EPA will determine the engines for which the condition on the  certificate was not satisfied by designating engines in the Class V  engine family with the highest HC+NOX FELs first and  continuing progressively downward through the Class V engine families  until a number of engines having a credit need, as calculated under  paragraph (a) of this section, equal to the remaining deficit is  reached. If this calculation determines that only a portion of engines  in a Class V engine family contribute to the deficit situation, then EPA  will designate a subset of actual engines in that engine family as not  covered by the certificate, starting with the last engine produced and  counting backwards. EPA may request additional information from the  manufacturer that would help identify the actual engine not covered by  the certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In determining the engine count, EPA will calculate the mass of  credits based on the factors identified in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a manufacturer is purchased by, merges with or otherwise  combines with another manufacturer, the manufacturer continues to be  responsible for offsetting any deficits outstanding within the required  time period. Any failure to offset the deficits will be considered to be  a violation of paragraph (g)(1) of this section and may subject the  manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of engines not covered by  a certificate, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a manufacturer that has a deficit ceases production of  handheld engines, the manufacturer will be considered immediately in  violation of paragraph (g)(1) of this section and may be subject to an  enforcement action for sale of engines not covered by a certificate,  pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, a  violation of the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a  failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) was issued  and hence a sale of engines not covered by the certificate, all occur  upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting deficits specified in  paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
