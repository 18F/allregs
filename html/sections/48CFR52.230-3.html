If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that  the Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets and commercial or  financial information which is privileged and confidential, the  Disclosure Statement shall be protected and shall not be released  outside of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting  practices. A change to such practices may be proposed, however, by  either the Government or the Contractor, and the Contractor agrees to  negotiate with the Contracting Officer the terms and conditions under  which a change may be made. After the terms and conditions under which  the change is to be made have been agreed to, the change must be applied  prospectively to this contract, and the Disclosure Statement, if  affected, must be amended accordingly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Contractor shall, when the parties agree to a change to a  cost accounting practice and the Contracting Officer has made the  finding required in 48 CFR 9903.201-6(c), that the change is desirable  and not detrimental to the interests of the Government, negotiate an  equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract.  In the absence of the required finding, no agreement may be made under  this contract clause that will increase costs paid by the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance,  as appropriate, if the Contractor or a subcontractor fails to comply  with the applicable CAS or to follow any cost accounting practice, and  such failure results in any increased costs paid by the United States.  Such adjustment shall provide for recovery of the increased costs to the  United States together with interest thereon computed at the annual rate  established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal   Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)), from the time the payment  by the United States was made to the time the adjustment is effected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor has complied  with an applicable CAS, rule, or regulation as specified in 48 CFR parts  9903 and 9904 and as to any cost adjustment demanded by the United  States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute under 41 U.S.C.  chapter 71, Contract Disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of  the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, and  records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts,  which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except  paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other  subcontracts of any tier, except that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant  to 48 CFR 9903.201-2 is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the  substance of the applicable clause set forth in subsection 30.201-4 of  the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be inserted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This requirement shall apply only to negotiated subcontracts in  excess of $750,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts  otherwise exempt from the requirement to include a CAS clause as  specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)  [57 FR 39592, Aug. 31, 1992; 57 FR 43495, Sept. 21, 1992, as amended at  59 FR 67044, Dec. 28, 1994; 61 FR 18919, Apr. 29, 1996; 63 FR 9054, Feb.  23, 1998; 73 FR 54012, Sept. 17, 2008; 77 FR 27551, May 10, 2012; 79 FR  24223, Apr. 29, 2014; 80 FR 38300, July 2, 2015]</p>
