                                Sec. 10.912  What is required to establish a claim for the death
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Claim form CA-41 describes the basic requirements. Much of the  required information will be provided by the employing agency when it  completes notification form CA-42. However, the claimant bears the  burden of proof to ensure that OWCP has the evidence needed to establish  the claim. OWCP may send any request for additional evidence to the  claimant and to his or her representative, if any. Evidence should be  submitted in writing. The evidence submitted must be reliable,  probative, and substantial. Each claim for the death gratuity must  establish the following before OWCP can pay the gratuity:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> That the claim was filed within the time limits specified by the  FECA, as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 8122 and this part. Timeliness is based  on the date that the claimant filed the claim for the death gratuity  under Sec. 10.911, not the date the employing agency submitted form CA- 42. As procedures for accepting and paying retroactive claims were not  available prior to the publication of the interim final rule, the  applicable statute of limitations began to run for a retroactive payment  under this subpart on August 18, 2009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> That the injured person, at the time he or she incurred the  injury or disease, was an employee of the United States as defined in 5  U.S.C. 8101(1) and Sec. 10.5(h) of this part, or a non-appropriated  fund instrumentality employee, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 1587(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> That the injury or disease occurred and that the employee's  death was causally related to that injury or disease. The death  certificate of the employee must be provided. Often, the employing  agency will provide the death certificate and any needed medical  documentation. OWCP may request from the claimant any additional  documentation that may be needed to establish the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> That the employee incurred the injury or disease in connection  with the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency  operation. This will be determined from evidence provided by the  employing agency or otherwise obtained by OWCP and from any evidence  provided by the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 8102a defines ``contingency operation'' to include  humanitarian operations, peacekeeping operations, and similar  operations. (``Similar operations'' will be determined by OWCP.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A ``contingency operation'' is defined by 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)  as a military operation that--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in  which members of the armed forces are or may become involved in military  actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United  States or against an opposing military force; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of  members of the uniformed services under section 688, 12301(a), 12302,  12304, 12305, or 12406 of Title 10, chapter 15 of Title 10, or any other  provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by  the President or Congress.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A ``humanitarian or peacekeeping operation'' is defined by 10  U.S.C. 2302(8) as a military operation in support of the provision of  humanitarian or foreign disaster assistance or in support of a  peacekeeping operation under chapter VI or VII of the Charter of the  United Nations. The term does not include routine training, force  rotation, or stationing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Humanitarian assistance'' is defined by 10 U.S.C. 401(e) to  mean medical, surgical, dental, and veterinary care provided in areas of  a country that are rural or are underserved by medical, surgical,  dental, and veterinary professionals, respectively, including education,  training, and technical assistance related to the care provided;  construction of rudimentary surface transportation systems; well  drilling and construction of basic sanitation facilities; rudimentary  construction and repair of public facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contingency operation may take place within the United States  or abroad. However, operations of the National Guard are only considered  ``contingency operations'' for purposes of this subpart when the  President, Secretary of the Army, or Secretary of the Air Force calls  the members of the National Guard into service. A ``contingency  operation'' does not include operations of the National Guard when  called into service by a Governor of a State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To show that the injury or disease was incurred ``in connection  with'' the employee's service with an Armed Force in a contingency  operation, the claim must show that the employee incurred the injury or  disease while in the performance of duty as that phrase is defined for  the purposes of otherwise awarding benefits under FECA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the contingency operation occurs outside of the United  States, OWCP will find that an employee's injury or disease was incurred  ``in connection with'' the employee's service with an Armed Force in a  contingency operation if the employee incurred the injury or disease  while performing assignments in the same region as the operation, unless  there is conclusive evidence that the employee's service was not  supporting the Armed Force's operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Economic or social development projects, including service on  Provincial Reconstruction Teams, undertaken by covered employees in  regions where an Armed Force is engaged in a contingency operation will  be considered to be supporting the Armed Force's operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To show that an employee's injury or disease was incurred ``in  connection with'' the employee's service with an Armed Force in a  contingency operation, the claimant will be required to establish that  the employee's service was supporting the Armed Force's operation. The  death gratuity does not cover Federal employees who are performing  service within the United States that is not supporting activity being  performed by an Armed Force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The claimant must establish his or her relationship to the  deceased employee so that OWCP can determine whether the claimant is the  survivor entitled to receive the death gratuity payment according to the  order of precedence prescribed in Sec. 10.907.</p>
