                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever the Commissioner determines after investigation that a  manufacturer, processor, or packer of a food for which a regulation has  been promulgated in subpart B of this part does not meet the mandatory  conditions and requirements established in such regulation, he shall  issue to such manufacturer, processor, or packer an order determining  that a permit shall be required before the food may be introduced or  delivered for introduction into interstate commerce by that person. The  order shall specify the mandatory conditions and requirements with which  there is a lack of compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer, processor, or packer shall have 3 working days  after receipt of such order within which to file objections. Such  objections may be filed by telegram, telex, or any other mode of written  communication addressed to the Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration (HFS-605), 5100 Paint Branch  Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740. If such objections are filed, the  determination is stayed pending a hearing to be held within 5 working  days after the filing of objections on the issues involved unless the  Commissioner determines that the objections raise no genuine and  substantial issue of fact to justify a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Commissioner finds that there is an imminent hazard to  health, the order shall contain this finding and the reasons therefor,  and shall state that the determination of the need for a permit is  effective immediately pending an expedited hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A hearing under this section shall be conducted by the  Commissioner or his designee at a location agreed upon by the objector  and the Commissioner or, if such agreement cannot be reached, at a  location designated by the Commissioner. The manufacturer, processor, or  packer shall have the right to cross-examine the Food and Drug  Administration's witnesses and to present witnesses on his own behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 5 working days after the hearing, and based on the  evidence presented at the hearing, the Commissioner shall determine  whether a permit is required and shall so inform the manufacturer,  processor, or packer in writing, with the reasons for his decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commissioner's determination of the need for a permit  constitutes final agency action from which appeal lies to the courts.  The Commissioner will not stay a determination of the need for a permit  pending court appeal except in unusual circumstances, but will  participate in expediting any such appeal.
