                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic provision. An individual who meets the requirements of  Sec. 406.20 (b) or (c) may enroll for premium hospital insurance only  during his or her ``initial enrollment period'', a ``general enrollment  period'', a ``special enrollment period'', or, for HMO/CMP enrollees, a  ``transfer enrollment period'', as set forth in paragraphs (b) through  (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (b)(3) through the third  month after that first month of eligibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial enrollment period of individual under age 65. The  initial enrollment period begins with the month in which the individual  receives notice that entitlement to Medicare Part A will end because he  or she has lost entitlement to disability benefits solely because of  earnings in excess of the amounts allowed under the social security  regulations on substantial gainful activity (20 CFR 404.1571-404.1574).  It continues for 7 full months after that month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General enrollment period. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph  (c)(4) of this section, the general enrollment period extends from  January 1 to March 31 of each calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General enrollment periods are for individuals who do not enroll  during the special enrollment period, who failed to enroll during the  initial enrollment period, or whose previous period of entitlement had  terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the individual enrolls or reenrolls during a general  enrollment period, his or her entitlement begins on July 1 of the  calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the period April 1 through September 30, 1981, the  general enrollment period was any time after the end of the individual's  initial enrollment period. Any eligible individual whose initial  enrollment period has ended, or whose previous period of entitlement had  terminated, could enroll or reenroll during that 6-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ``Deemed'' initial enrollment period for individual age 65 or  over. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an individual who has attained age 65 fails to enroll  during the initial enrollment period because of reliance on incorrect  documentary information which led him or her to believe that he or she  was not yet age 65, an initial enrollment period may be established for  him or her as though he or she had attained age 65 on the date indicated  by the incorrect documentary information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The deemed initial enrollment period will be used to determine  the individual's premium and right to enroll in a general enrollment  period if such use is advantageous to the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transfer enrollment period for HMO/CMP enrollees--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Terminology. HMO or CMP means an eligible organization as defined in  Sec. 417.401 which has a contract with CMS under part 417, subpart L of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Basic rule. Effective February 1, 1991, individuals enrolled in  an HMO or CMP under part 417, subpart K of this chapter who meet the  requirements of Sec. 406.20(b) may enroll in premium hospital insurance  during a transfer enrollment period. This transfer enrollment period  begins with any month or any part of a month in which the individual is  enrolled in an HMO or CMP and ends with the last day of the 8th  consecutive month in which the individual is no longer enrolled in the  HMO or CMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective date of coverage. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the individual enrolls in  premium hospital insurance while still enrolled in an HMO or CMP, or  during the first month that he or she is no longer enrolled in the HMO  or CMP, part A coverage will begin on the first day of the month of part  A enrollment, or, at the option of the individual, on the first day of  any of the following 3 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the individual enrolls in premium hospital insurance during  any of the last 7 months of the transfer enrollment period, coverage  will begin on the first day of the month after the month of enrollment.
