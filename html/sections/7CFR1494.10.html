                            <p class="depth0">This subpart sets forth the criteria to be considered in evaluating and approving proposals for initiatives to facilitate export sales under the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) Export Enhancement Program (EEP). These criteria are interrelated and will be considered together in order to select eligible commodities and eligible countries for EEP initiatives which will best meet the program's objectives. The objectives of the program are to discourage unfair trade practices by other countries, to increase U.S. agricultural commodity exports, and to encourage other countries exporting agricultural commodities to undertake serious negotiations on agricultural trade problems. Under the EEP, bonuses are made available by CCC to enable exporters to meet prevailing world prices for targeted commodities in targeted destinations. In the operation of the EEP, CCC will make reasonable efforts to avoid the displacement of usual marketings of U.S. agricultural commodities.</p>
