When combined with the amounts   claimed on each of the State's four quarterly expenditure reports, the  portion of the annual estimated incentive payment as reported each  quarter will be included in the calculation of the next quarterly grant  awarded to the State under title IV-D of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Following the end of each fiscal year, HHS will calculate the  State's annual incentive payment, using the actual collection and  expenditure data and the performance data submitted by December 31st by  the State and other States for that fiscal year. A positive or negative  grant will then be awarded to the State under title IV-D of the Act to  reconcile an actual annual incentive payment that has been calculated to  be greater or lesser, respectively, than the annual incentive payment  estimated prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment of incentives is contingent on a State's data being  determined complete and reliable by Federal auditors.</p>
