                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. In order to establish export price, constructed  export price, and normal value, the Secretary must make certain  adjustments to the price to the unaffiliated purchaser (often called the  ``starting price'') in both the United States and foreign markets. This  regulation clarifies how the Secretary will make certain of the  adjustments to the starting price in the United States that are required  by section 772 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional adjustments to constructed export price. In  establishing constructed export price under section 772(d) of the Act,  the Secretary will make adjustments for expenses associated with  commercial activities in the United States that relate to the sale to an  unaffiliated purchaser, no matter where or when paid. The Secretary will  not make an adjustment for any expense that is related solely to the  sale to an affiliated importer in the United States, although the  Secretary may make an adjustment to normal value for such expenses under  section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rule for merchandise with value added after  importation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Merchandise imported by affiliated persons. In applying  section 772(e) of the Act, merchandise imported by and value added by a  person affiliated with the exporter or producer includes merchandise  imported and value added for the account of such an affiliated person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Estimation of value added. The Secretary normally will determine  that the value added in the United States by the affiliated person is  likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise if  the Secretary estimates the value added to be at least 65 percent of the  price charged to the first unaffiliated purchaser for the merchandise as  sold in the United States. The Secretary normally will estimate the  value added based on the difference between the price charged to the  first unaffiliated purchaser for the merchandise as sold in the United  States and the price paid for the subject merchandise by the affiliated  person. The Secretary normally will base this determination on averages  of the prices and the value added to the subject merchandise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining dumping margins. For purposes of determining dumping  margins under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 772(e) of the Act, the  Secretary may use the weighted-average dumping margins calculated on  sales of identical or other subject merchandise sold to unaffiliated  persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rule for determining profit. This paragraph sets forth  rules for calculating profit in establishing constructed export price  under section 772(f) of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basis for total expenses and total actual profit. In calculating  total expenses and total actual profit, the Secretary normally will use  the aggregate of expenses and profit for all subject merchandise sold in  the United States and all foreign like products sold in the exporting  country, including sales that have been disregarded as being below the  cost of production. (See section 773(b) of the Act (sales at less than  cost of production).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of financial reports. For purposes of determining profit  under section 772(d)(3) of the Act, the Secretary may rely on any  appropriate financial reports, including public, audited financial  statements, or equivalent financial reports, and internal financial  reports prepared in the ordinary course of business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Voluntary reporting of costs of production. The Secretary will  not require the reporting of costs of production solely for purposes of  determining the amount of profit to be deducted from the constructed  export price. The Secretary will base the calculation of profit on costs  of production if such costs are reported voluntarily by the date  established by the Secretary, and provided that it is practicable to do  so and the costs of production are verifiable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of payments between affiliated persons. Where a person  affiliated with the exporter or producer incurs any of the expenses  deducted from constructed export price under section 772(d) of the Act  and is reimbursed for such expenses by the exporter, producer or other  affiliate, the Secretary normally will make an adjustment based on the  actual cost to the affiliated person. If the Secretary is satisfied that  information regarding the actual cost to the affiliated person is  unavailable to the exporter or producer, the Secretary may determine the  amount of the adjustment on any other reasonable basis, including the  amount of the reimbursement to the affiliated person if the Secretary is  satisfied that such amount reflects the amount usually paid in the  market under consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reimbursement of antidumping duties and countervailing duties-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In calculating the export price (or the constructed  export price), the Secretary will deduct the amount of any antidumping  duty or countervailing duty which the exporter or producer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Paid directly on behalf of the importer; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reimbursed to the importer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary will not deduct the amount of any antidumping  duty or countervailing duty paid or reimbursed if the exporter or  producer granted to the importer before initiation of the antidumping  investigation in question a warranty of nonapplicability of antidumping  duties or countervailing duties with respect to subject merchandise  which was:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Sold before the date of publication of the Secretary's order  applicable to the merchandise in question; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Exported before the date of publication of the Secretary's final  antidumping determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ordinarily, under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the  Secretary will deduct the amount reimbursed only once in the calculation  of the export price (or constructed export price).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certificate. The importer must file prior to liquidation a  certificate in the following form with the appropriate District Director  of Customs:  I hereby certify that I (have) (have not) entered into any agreement or  understanding for the payment or for the refunding to me, by the  manufacturer, producer, seller, or exporter, of all or any part of the  antidumping duties or countervailing duties assessed upon the following  importations of (commodity) from (country): (List entry numbers) which  have been purchased on or after (date of publication of antidumping  notice suspending liquidation in the Federal Register) or purchased  before (same date) but exported on or after (date of final determination  of sales at less than fair value).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Presumption. The Secretary may presume from an importer's  failure to file the certificate required in paragraph (f)(2) of this  section that the exporter or producer paid or reimbursed the antidumping  duties or countervailing duties.</p>
