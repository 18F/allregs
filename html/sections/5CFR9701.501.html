                            <p class="depth0">This subpart contains the regulations implementing the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 9701(b) relating to the Department's labor-management relations system. The Department was created in recognition of the paramount interest in safeguarding the American people, without compromising statutorily protected employee rights. For this reason

Congress stressed that personnel systems established by the Department and OPM must be flexible and contemporary, enabling the Department to rapidly respond to threats to our Nation. The labor-management relations regulations in this subpart are designed to meet these compelling concerns and must be interpreted with the Department's mission foremost in mind. The regulations also recognize the rights of DHS employees to organize and bargain collectively, subject to any exclusion from coverage or limitation on negotiability established by law, including these regulations, applicable Executive orders, and any other legal authority.</p>
