                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The degree and nature of the risk of injury. The Commission  finds that the risk of injury which this regulation is designed to  eliminate or reduce is the risk of injury of burns from explosive vapor  ignition and flashback fire associated with extremely flammable contact  adhesives as defined in this rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Degree of the risk of injury presented by extremely flammable  contact adhesives. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In October 1976, the Commission's staff prepared  a report entitled Hazard Analysis on Contact Adhesive Fires. According  to the Hazard Analysis, three factors that measure burn severity are  percent of body burned, days hospitalized, and whether clothing ignition  occurs. Injury data sources summarized in the Hazard Analysis reveal  that contact adhesive fires often result in a high percent of body  burned, result in many days hospitalized, and usually involve clothing  ignition burns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The American Burn Association (ABA) participated in a special  survey with the Commission to obtain an estimate of the incidence and  severity of burns associated with the use of contact adhesive cements.  In January 1976, the President of the ABA sent a letter to the 1,300 ABA  members asking the members to record any thermal injuries or deaths that  have occurred between January 1975 and March 1976 associated with  contact adhesives. In November 1976, the Chairman of the ABA Committee  on Burn Prevention submitted a statement to the Commission estimating  that between 45 and 125 contact adhesive related injuries are treated  annually in hospital emergency rooms. Although ABA members reported an  annual rate of 20 severe burn injuries for the January 1975 to March  1976 period, the actual rate of severe burn injuries may be higher,  since only approximately 400 hospitals, less than 10 percent of the  country's short-term hospitals, are represented in ABA membership. The  results of the ABA survey, as reported by the ABA Chairman, showed that  the injuries treated by members resulted in an average hospitalization  of 42 days, almost double the length of stay for all burn victims in  special facilities for burns. According to the ABA Chairman, when a burn  victim experiences such a lengthy stay, it is an indication of very  severe injury and predicts a lengthy period of recuperation and  potentially permanent physical and psychological consequences.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Hazard Analysis prepared by the Commission's staff also  contains a summary of the results of the ABA survey. According to the  Commission's staff, the ABA survey revealed 33 incidents with sufficient  details for analysis. Nine of the victims died from their burns and 21  were hospitalized. The average body area burned was 40 percent. In  addition, the victims' clothing ignited on all except three of the 33  victims.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Hazard Analysis also contains a summary of contact adhesive  related fires in the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Fire  Incident Data Organization (FIDO), a computerized file of fire  experience that includes data collected from 1971 to 1975. The NFPA  files contained reports of 38 fires from 1971 to 1975, seven of which  occurred in residences. These seven fires resulted in injuries to  fifteen persons and deaths to three persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In addition to the above injury information, the Hazard Analysis  also indicates that the Commission has received three death certificates  specifying the involvement of an adhesive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> According to the hazard analysis, after cases from the various  data sources were verified as being mutually exclusive, at least 130  persons have been injured in contact adhesive fires since 1970. Fifteen  of these persons subsequently died from the injuries they sustained in  these accidents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Technical analysis of extremely flammable contact adhesives by  the Commission's staff indicates that the degree of the hazard  associated with these products is such that as little as one pint of  extremely flammable contact adhesive may produce a substantial explosion  hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nature of the risk of injury presented by flammable contact  adhesives. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>   Technical analysis of these substances by the Commission's staff  indicates that extremely flammable contact adhesives have a low flash  point (20 [deg]F or below), a rapid evaporation rate (as a result of a  high percentage of solvents, 70-90 percent by weight), a low percentage  of solids, 10-30 percent by weight, and a low wet-viscosity (300-6,000  centipoise when measured by an RVF Brookfield viscometer).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Flash point, viscosity, low solid to high solvent ratio,  evaporation rate, size of the application area, and rate of application  are factors which determine the potential for creating an ignitable  vapor situation. The rapid rate of evaporation of extremely volatile,  low flash point solvents from extremely flammable contact adhesives is  capable of creating a highly explosive atmosphere. The flammable nature  of these contact adhesives is such that the vaporized solvents from  these products can be ignited by a sparking electric motor or an  overlooked pilot light in an area remote from the site of use. Analysis  of actual injury reports by the Commission's staff reveals that  extremely flammable contact adhesives have, in fact, been ignited by  many ignition sources including oven and stove pilot lights, water  heater and furnace pilot lights, electric space heaters (without any  visible flame), sparks from a refrigerator motor and a wall receptacle,  and friction. Analysis of available injury reports has shown that these  ignition sources are frequently located in areas of the house remote  from the room in which the contact adhesive is being used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The possibility of ignition from a source in another room or  another part of the house may well be overlooked by the public, in spite  of warnings on the label of the product. Ignition of the vapors may  result in a sudden, flash back fire from the source of vapor ignition to  the container of adhesive with little or no warning to the consumer and  with the potential for serious or fatal injury to the user or  bystanders. The injury information available to the Commission shows  that the vast majority of accidents occur while the product is being  used for its intended purpose. The potential for serious injury,  therefore, appears to be present during normal use of the product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Although the Commission has in the past required the extremely  flammable contact adhesives now subject to this ban to bear minimum  cautionary labeling for the hazard caused by the extreme flammability of  the mixture, the Commission finds that this cautionary labeling is  inadequate to protect the public. An analysis prepared by the Commission  staff of the available injury data indicates that in spite of the  cautionary labeling, accidents have continued to occur, inflicting  serious injuries in much the same manner as those accidents that  occurred prior to the issuance of the 1970 labeling regulation. The  cautionary labeling presently required could be revised to include more  explicit and graphic warnings. However, as a result of the degree and  nature of the risk of injury presented by the product, this labeling  would also provide inadequate protection to the public. The degree and  nature of the risk of injury is such that a bystander or visitor could  present an ignition source resulting in an accident. Since the bystander  or visitor would not normally have an opportunity to read the warning  label on the product, additional labeling would not benefit these  potential victims. The possibility of ignition from a source in another  room or another part of the house may well be overlooked by the public,  in spite of warnings on the label of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Products subject to this ban. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The products banned by this  rule are listed in Sec. 1302.1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission finds that the types of products subject to this  ban are those contact adhesives that are extremely flammable and are  packaged in containers of more than one-half pint. The average annual  consumption of all types of contact adhesives in the United States is  estimated at approximately 25 million gallons. Of this, it is estimated  that 4-5 million gallons are sold in containers of 1 gallon or less, the  sizes consumers generally buy. Professional users are estimated to  purchase about half of the contact adhesives in this size range with  most purchases probably of gallon containers.   Therefore, consumers probably purchase 2-2.5 million gallon of all  contact adhesives, most of which is estimated to be in quart containers,  and a smaller amount in containers of one pint or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In early 1976, contact adhesive sales were estimated as 80  percent extremely flammable, 10 percent chlorinated-solvent based, and  10 percent water-based. Since that time, a flammable petroleum solvent  based contact adhesive has been developed and there has been a trend  away from extremely flammable to flammable and nonflammable for consumer  use. Although this trend is evident, reliable estimates of current  market shares are not available. A rough estimate would be that perhaps  50 percent of contact adhesives in container sizes of more than one-half  pint to 1 gallon are extremely flammable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Need of the public for the products and effects of the rule on  their utility, cost, and availability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The need for contact adhesives. Contact adhesives are used  primarily for bonding plastic laminates to counter and table tops, for  applying tile board to walls, and for applying some types of flooring.  Other uses include bonding metals, wood, leather, linoleum, tiles,  rubber and plastics. Contact adhesives may also be used in furniture  construction and repairs. There are contact adhesives available other  than the extremely flammable type and other alternatives to contact  adhesives that consumers can use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Probable effects of the ban on the utility of contact adhesives.  Of the three general types of contact adhesive other than extremely  flammable contact adhesives, flammable and non-flammable (chlorinated)  contact adhesives have about the same general performance  characteristics as extremely flammable contact adhesives. Therefore,  because these two products are available to the public, the Commission  believes the ban will have little impact on the utility of contact  adhesives. In terms of performance characteristics, there is little  difference between flammable and extremely flammable contact adhesives.  Although the extremely flammable product requires approximately 10  minutes of drying time before the item can be bonded, the flammable  product requires about 20 minutes. This difference in time is not likely  to be significant for most consumers who do ordinary home improvement or  repair work. The performance characteristics of non-flammable  chlorinated based contact adhesives are similar to those of the  extremely flammable type for most applications. Non-flammable  chlorinated based contact adhesives may be unacceptable for applications  involving leather. Water based contact adhesives may not be as  satisfactory, in terms of performance characteristics, as the other  contact adhesives. The drying time for water-based contact adhesives  varies with humidity. Although manufacturers of water-based neoprene  contact adhesives claim that their products will dry in 30 minutes, for  most of the country a drying time from one to four hours is probably  more realistic. It is possible that the adhesive will never dry in some  areas of the country with very high humidity. The time needed for the  adhesive to adhere after joining (open time) will also vary with the  humidity. Water-based acrylic contact adhesives are similar to neoprene  type adhesives in terms of the effect of humidity on drying time. The  neoprene and acrylic based adhesives are not completely satisfactory for  binding some substances with non-porous surfaces, such as metals. In  addition, the water in these adhesives might have an adverse effect on  leather. Neoprene water-based adhesives may become unstable if frozen  and thawed several times. This may occur during shipping or storage in  some areas of the country during deaths associated with the extreme  winter. To the extent that injuries and flammable contact adhesives are  reduced or eliminated as a result of the ban, the utility of contact  adhesives will be increased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Probable effects of the ban upon the cost of contact adhesives.  For gallon containers, the Commission estimates that the contact  adhesives available as substitutes for the extremely flammable type may  cost in the range of $1-$6 more than the extremely flammable type.  Although a gallon of extremely flammable contact adhesive may cost   $7.50-$10.50, a gallon of flammable contact adhesive may cost from $8- $11, a gallon of nonflammable chlorinated base contact adhesive may cost  from $12-$15, a gallon of water-based neoprene contact adhesive may cost  from $11-$16, and a gallon of water-based acrylic contact adhesive may  cost from $10-$15.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Probable effect of the ban on the availability of contact  adhesives to meet the need of the public. The Commission estimates that  the ban will not have any effect on the availability or use of contact  adhesives. Manufacturers are most likely to switch production to  flammable petroleum-based and to 1,1,1,-trichloroethane (1,1,1,-TCE)  based or water-based contact adhesives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternatives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission has considered other means of  achieving the objective of this rule, such as labeling, but has found  none that would achieve the objective of this ban, consistent with the  public health and safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission believes that any adverse effects of the ban  should be minimal and would be expected to be confined to some shift in  distribution patterns to accommodate professional users, including  methods of distinguishing between professional users and consumers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission finds that competition should not be  significantly affected by this rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conclusion. The Commission finds that this rule, including its  effective date, is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the  unreasonable risk of injury of burns from explosive vapor ignition and  flashback fire that is associated with the banned products described in  Sec. 1302.3(b). The Commission also finds that issuance of the rule is  in the public interest. The Commission also finds that no feasible  consumer product safety standard under the act would adequately protect  the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with the  product.</p>
