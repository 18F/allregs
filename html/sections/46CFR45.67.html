Where the height of superstructure exceeds the standard, the least difference (Z) between the actual and standard heights must be added to each end ordinate. Similarly, the intermediate ordinates at distance of \1/6\ L and \1/3\ L from each perpendicular must be increased by 0.444 Z and 0.111 Z respectively.</p>
