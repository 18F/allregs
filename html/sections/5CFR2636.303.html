                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Covered noncareer employee means an employee, other than a Special Government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, who occupies a position classified above GS-15 of the General Schedule or, in the case of positions not under the General Schedule, for which the rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than 120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay payable for GS-15 of the General Schedule, and who is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appointed by the President to a position described in the Executive Schedule, 5 U.S.C. 5312 through 5317, or to a position that, by statute or as a matter of practice, is filled by Presidential appointment, other than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A position within the uniformed services; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A position within the foreign service below the level of Assistant Secretary or Chief of Mission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A noncareer member of the Senior Executive Service or of another SES-type system, such as the Senior Foreign Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appointed to a Schedule C position or to a position under an agency-specific statute that establishes appointment criteria essentially the same as those set forth in Sec. 213.3301 of this title for Schedule C positions; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appointed to a noncareer executive assignment position or to a position under an agency-specific statute that establishes appointment criteria essentially the same as those for noncareer executive assignment positions.
For purposes of applying this definition to an individual who holds a General Schedule or other position that provides several rates of pay or steps per grade, his rate of basic pay shall be the rate of pay for the lowest step of the grade at which he is employed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A Schedule C appointee to a position with the United States Information Agency who holds a GS-15 position and who is compensated at the rate for GS-15, Step 9 is not a covered noncareer employee even though the pay he receives in a calendar year exceeds the annual pay for a position above GS-15. Notwithstanding that he is compensated at Step 9, the basic rate of pay for the GS-15 position he holds is the rate in effect for GS-15, Step 1 of the General Schedule, which is lower than the rate for a position above GS-15.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. An employee of the Environmental Protection Agency who has been a

career GS-15 employee for 10 years and who is offered a non-career SES position with the Federal Aviation Administration will, if he accepts the offer, become a covered noncareer employee by reason of that appointment, regardless of his former status.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A Department of Justice employee who holds a Schedule A appointment is not a covered noncareer employee even though he does not have competitive status within the meaning of Sec. 212.301 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Outside earned income and compensation both mean wages, salaries, honoraria, commissions, professional fees and any other form of compensation for services other than salary, benefits and allowances paid by the United States Government. Neither term includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Items that may be accepted under applicable standards of conduct gift regulations if they were offered by a prohibited source;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Income attributable to service with the military reserves or national guard;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Income from pensions and other continuing benefits attributable to previous employment or services;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Income from investment activities where the individual's services are not a material factor in the production of income;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Copyright royalties, fees, and their functional equivalent, from the use or sale of copyright, patent and similar forms of intellectual property rights, when received from established users or purchasers of those rights;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Actual and necessary expenses incurred by the employee in connection with an outside activity. Where such expenses are paid or reimbursed by another person, the amount of any such payment shall not be counted as compensation or outside earned income. Where such expenses are not paid or reimbursed, the amount of compensation or earned income shall be determined by subtracting the actual and necessary expenses incurred by the employee from any payment received for the activity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Compensation for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Services rendered prior to January 1, 1991, or prior to becoming a covered noncareer employee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Services rendered in satisfaction of a covered noncareer employee's obligation under a contract entered into prior to January 1, 1991; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Services which the covered noncareer employee first undertook to provide prior to January 1, 1991, where the standards of the applicable profession require the employee to complete the case or other undertaking.</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. A covered noncareer employee is a limited partner in a partnership that invests in commercial real estate. Because he does not take an active role in the management of the partnership, his share of the partnership income is neither ``outside earned income'' nor ``compensation.''</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. A covered noncareer employee of the Civil Rights Commission serves without compensation as a member of the Board of Visitors for a university. The roundtrip airfare and hotel expenses paid by the university to permit him to attend quarterly meetings of the Board are neither ``outside earned income'' or ``compensation.''</p><p class="depth4">Example 3. Where a covered noncareer employee pays for transcripts of a hearing in which he is providing pro bono legal representation, reimbursements for those expenses by a legal aid organization are neither ``outside earned income'' nor ``compensation.''</p><p class="depth4">Example 4. During the term of his appointment, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor enters into a contract to write a book of fictional short stories. Royalties based on actual sales of the book after publication are investment income attributable to the property interest he retains in the book and, as such, are neither ``outside earned income'' nor ``compensation.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Receive means that the employee has the right to exercise dominion and control over the compensation or outside earned income and direct its subsequent use. Compensation or outside earned income is received by an employee if it is for his conduct and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If it is paid to any other person on the basis of designation, recommendation or other specification by the employee; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence, it is paid to his parent, sibling, spouse, child or dependent relative.

Compensation that is prohibited by Sec. 2636.305 through Sec. 2636.307 of this subpart is received while an individual is an employee if it is for conduct by him that occurs while an employee, even though actual payment may be deferred until after Federal employment

has terminated. Also, compensation or outside earned income donated to a charitable organization is received by the employee.
