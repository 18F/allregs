                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contracting officer shall make every effort to ensure that  contract award is made before expiration of the project wage  determination included in the solicitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following procedure applies when contracting by sealed  bidding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a project wage determination for the primary site of the work  expires before bid opening, or if it appears before bid opening that a  project wage determination may expire before award, the contracting  officer shall request a new determination early enough to ensure its  receipt before bid opening. If necessary, the contracting officer shall  postpone the bid opening date to allow a reasonable time to obtain the  determination, amend the solicitation to incorporate the new  determination, and permit bidders to amend their bids. If the new  determination does not change the wage rates and would not warrant  amended bids, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to  include the number and date of the new determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a project wage determination for the primary site of the work  expires after bid opening but before award, the contracting officer  shall request an extension of the project wage determination expiration  date from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. The request for  extension shall be supported by a written finding, which shall include a  brief statement of factual support, that the extension is necessary and  proper in the public interest to prevent injustice or undue hardship or  to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business. If  necessary, the contracting officer shall delay award to permit either  receipt of the extension or receipt and processing of a new  determination. If the request is granted, the contracting officer shall  award the contract and modify it to apply the extended expiration date  to the already incorporated project wage determination. (See  43.103(b)(1).) If the request is denied, the Administrator will proceed  to issue a new project wage determination. Upon receipt, the contracting  officer shall process the new determination as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the new determination for the primary site of the work  changes any wage rates for classifications to be used in the contract,  the contracting officer may cancel the solicitation only in accordance  with 14.404-1. Otherwise the contracting officer shall award the  contract and incorporate the new determination to be effective on the  date of contract award. The contracting officer shall equitably adjust  the contract price for any increased or decreased cost of performance  resulting from any changed wage rates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the new determination for the primary site of the work does  not change any wage rates, the contracting officer shall award the  contract and modify it to include the number and date of the new  determination. (See 43.103(b)(1).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following procedure applies when contracting by negotiation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a project wage determination will or does expire before  contract award, the contracting officer shall request a new wage  determination from the Department of Labor. If necessary, the  contracting officer shall delay award while the new determination is  obtained and processed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer need not delay opening and reviewing  proposals or discussing them with the offerors while a new determination  for the primary site of the work is being obtained. The contracting  officer shall request offerors to extend the period for acceptance of  any proposal if that period expires or may expire before receipt and  full processing of the new determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the new determination for the primary site of the work  changes any wage rates, the contracting officer shall amend the  solicitation to incorporate the new determination, and furnish the wage  rate information to all prospective offerors that were sent a  solicitation if the closing date for receipt of proposals has not yet  occurred, or to all offerors that have not been eliminated from the  competition if the closing date has passed. All offerors to whom wage  rate information has been furnished shall be given reasonable  opportunity to amend their proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the new determination for the primary site of the work does  not change any wage rates, the contracting officer shall amend the  solicitation to include the number and date of the new determination and  award the contract.
