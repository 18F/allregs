L. 100-177, which provides a time-limited opportunity for persons who were, on November 1, 1987, in breach of a written contract under the Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program or the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program to satisfy their scholarship obligations through full-time clinical service. These regulations do not apply to any Public Health and National Health Service Corps Scholarship Training Program or National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program obligation which the Secretary has determined was completely satisfied through service or monetary payment prior to November 1, 1987. The purpose of this program is to supply trained health professionals for the National Health Service Corps, which is used by the Secretary to improve the delivery of health services in health manpower shortage areas.</p>
