                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Location. The Regulated Navigation Area (RNA) includes all navigable waters of the Humboldt Bay Bar Channel and the Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel, Humboldt Bay, California.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0">COTP means the Captain of the Port as defined in Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1.01-30 and 3.55-20.</p><p class="depth0">Sector means Coast Guard Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay.</p><p class="depth0">Sector Commander means the Commanding Officer of Coast Guard Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous material means any of the materials or substances listed in 46 CFR 153.40.</p><p class="depth0">Humboldt Bay Area means the area described in the location section of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Oil means oil of any kind or in any form, including but not limited to, petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.</p><p class="depth0">Station means Coast Guard Station Humboldt Bay.</p><p class="depth0">Tank Vessel means any vessel that is constructed or adapted to carry, or that carries, oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. These regulations apply to the owners and operators of tank vessels transporting oil or hazardous material as cargo within the Humboldt Bay Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Regulations. (1) In addition to the arrival and departure notification requirements listed in title 33 CFR, part 160, Ports and Waterways Safety--General, subpart C--Notifications of ``Arrivals, Departures, Hazardous Conditions, and Certain Dangerous Cargoes'', the owner, master, agent or person in charge of a vessel to which this notice applies shall obtain permission to cross within four hours of crossing the Humboldt Bay Bar. Between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m., notification/requests for permission can be made to Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16, or at (707) 443-2213. If between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., or if unable to reach the Station, notification/requests for permission can be made directly to Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16 or at (707) 839-6113.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permission for a bar crossing by vessels or towing vessels and their tows to which this regulation applies is dependent on environmental and safety factors, including but not limited to: Sea state, winds, visibility, size and type of vessel or tow, wave period, time of day/night, and tidal currents. The final decision to close the bar rests with Humboldt Bay Sector Commander or his designated representative. At a minimum, Humboldt Bay Bar Channel

crossings by vessels subject to this advisory will generally not be permitted unless all of the following conditions exist: Proper permission to cross has been received, sea conditions at the bar are less than 6 feet, winds at the bar are less than 30 knots, the transit will take place during daylight hours, the vessel has only a single tow or no tow, the visibility at the bar is greater than 1,000 yards, and the vessel and tow are in proper operating condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the bar is closed to vessels to which this regulation applies, waiver requests will be accepted within four hours of crossing the entrance channel. If the waiver request is made between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m., the request should be made to Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16, or at (707) 443-2213. If between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., or if unable to reach the Station, the request can be made directly to Sector/Air Station Humboldt Bay on VHF-FM Channel 16 or at (707) 839-6113. Waiver requests must be made by the vessel master and must provide the following: A description of the proposed operation, the conditions for which the waiver is requested, the reasons for requesting the waiver, the reasons that the requester believes the proposed operation can be accomplished safely, and a callback phone number. The Station or Sector Watchstander receiving the request will brief the Officer in Charge of the Station who will then brief the Sector Commander. The authority to grant waivers rests with the Sector Commander or his designated representative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In addition to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)-(3) of this section, vessels transporting liquefied hazardous gases or compressed hazardous gases in bulk as cargo into or out of Humboldt Bay are required to be aided by two assist tugs. If the vessel carrying the gases is towed, the assist tug requirement is in addition to the towing tug. The assist tugs shall escort the vessel through its transit and must be stationed so as to provide immediate assistance in response to the loss of power or steering of the cargo vessel, its towing tug, or loss of control over the tow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vessels to which this regulation applies may be required by the Sector Commander or his designated representative to be escorted by a Coast Guard vessel during their transit. In addition, if a vessel master, agent, or pilot has concerns about the safety of a vessel's transit through the Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel, a Coast Guard escort may be requested. Requests for an escort should be directed to Station on VHF-FM channel 16 or at (707) 443-2213 between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m., or to Sector on VHF-FM channel 16 or at (707) 839-6113 if between 10 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Enforcement. Acting as a representative of the Captain of the Port, the Humboldt Bay Sector Commander will enforce this regulation and has the authority to take steps necessary to ensure the safe transit of vessels in Humboldt Bay. The Sector Commander can enlist the aid and cooperation of any Federal, State, county, and municipal agency to assist in the enforcement of the regulation. All persons and vessels shall comply with the instructions of the Sector Commander or the designated on-scene patrol personnel. Patrol personnel comprise commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard onboard Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, local, State, and Federal law enforcement vessels.</p><p class="depth0">Upon being hailed by U.S. Coast Guard patrol personnel by siren, radio, flashing light, or other means, the operator of a vessel shall proceed as directed.
