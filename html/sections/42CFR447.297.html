                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to the 50  States and the District of Columbia, but not to any State whose entire  Medicaid program is operated under a waiver granted under section 1115  of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> National payment target. The national payment target for  disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments for any Federal fiscal  year is equal to 12 percent of the total medical assistance expenditures  that will be made during the Federal fiscal year under State plans,  excluding administrative costs. A preliminary national expenditure  target will be published by CMS prior to October 1 of each year. This  preliminary national expenditure target will be superseded by a final  national expenditure target published by April 1 of each Federal fiscal  year, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State disproportionate share hospital allotments. Prior to  October 1 of each Federal fiscal year, CMS will publish in the Federal  Register preliminary State DSH allotments for each State. These  preliminary State DSH allotments will be determined using the most  current applicable actual and estimated State expenditure information as  reported to CMS and adjusted by CMS as may be necessary using the  methodology described in Sec.  447.298. CMS will publish final State DSH  allotments by April 1 of each Federal fiscal year, as described in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Final national disproportionate share hospitals expenditure  target and State disproportionate share hospitals allotments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS  will revise the preliminary national expenditure target and the  preliminary State DSH allotments by April 1 of each Federal fiscal year.  The final national DSH expenditure target and State DSH allotments will  be based on the most current applicable actual and estimated expenditure  information reported to CMS and adjusted by CMS as may be necessary  immediately prior to the April 1 publication date. The final national  expenditure target and State DSH allotments will not be recalculated for  that Federal fiscal year based upon any subsequent actual or estimated  expenditure information reported to CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If CMS determines that at any time a State has exceeded its  final DSH allotment for a Federal fiscal year, FFP attributable to the  excess DSH expenditures will be disallowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a State's actual DSH expenditures applicable to a Federal  fiscal year are less than its final State DSH allotment for that Federal  fiscal year, the State is permitted, to the extent allowed by its  approved State plan, to make additional DSH expenditures applicable to  that Federal fiscal year up to the amount of its final DSH allotment for  that Federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Publication of limits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before the beginning of each Federal  fiscal year, CMS will publish in the Federal Register--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A preliminary national DSH expenditure target for the Federal  fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A preliminary DSH allotment for each State for the Federal  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The final national DSH expenditure target and State DSH  allotments will be published in the Federal Register by April 1 of each  Federal fiscal year.
