                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Several liability of members of group. Except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, the common parent corporation and each  subsidiary which was a member of the group during any part of the  consolidated return year shall be severally liable for the tax for such  year computed in accordance with the regulations under section 1502  prescribed on or before the due date (not including extensions of time)  for the filing of the consolidated return for such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liability of subsidiary after withdrawal. If a subsidiary has  ceased to be a member of the group and in such cessation resulted from a  bona fide sale or exchange of its stock for fair value and occurred  prior to the date upon which any deficiency is assessed, the  Commissioner may, if he believes that the assessment or collection of  the balance of the deficiency will not be jeopardized, make assessment  and collection of such deficiency from such former subsidiary in an  amount not exceeding the portion of such deficiency which the  Commissioner may determine to be allocable to it. If the Commissioner  makes assessment and collection of any part of a deficiency from such  former subsidiary, then for purposes of any credit or refund of the  amount collected from such former subsidiary the agency of the common  parent under the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-77 shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of intercompany agreements. No agreement entered into by  one or more members of the group with any other member of such group or  with any other person shall in any case have the effect of reducing the  liability prescribed under this section.
