                            <p class="depth0">The Director may issue a permit under this part to any Class I UIC well (see Sec.  144.6) injecting hazardous wastes within a State in which no UIC program has been approved or promulgated. Any such permit shall apply and insure compliance with all applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart R (RCRA standards for wells), and shall be for a term not to exceed two years. No such permit shall be issued after approval or promulgation of a UIC program in the State. Any permit under this section shall contain a condition providing that it will terminate upon final action by the Director under a UIC program to issue or deny a UIC permit for the facility.
