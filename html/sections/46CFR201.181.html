                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general, the functions of the Administration involve hearing procedures comparable to those of a court and accordingly parties to proceedings before the Administration and persons representing these parties are expected to conduct themselves with honor and dignity. For the same reasons, the members of the Administration and those of its employees who participate with the Administration in the determination of formal proceedings are expected to conduct themselves with the same fidelity to standards of propriety that characterizes a court and its staff. The standing and the effectiveness of the Administration are in direct relation to the observance by it, its staff and the parties and attorneys appearing before it of the highest of judicial and professional ethics.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is essential in cases to be determined after notice and hearing and upon a record, or in any other cases which the Administration by order may designate, that the judicial character of the Administration be recognized and protected. As a consequence, from the time of the filing of an application or a petition which can be granted by the Administration only after notice and opportunity for hearing, or in the case of other matters from the time of notice by the Administration that such matters shall be determined after notice and opportunity for hearing, no ex parte communications, as hereinafter defined, are to constitute or be considered part of the record on which the final decision is to be predicated.</p>
