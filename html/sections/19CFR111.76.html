                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grounds for reopening. Provided that no appeal is filed in  accordance with Sec. 111.75, a person whose license or permit has been  suspended or revoked, or against whom a monetary penalty has been  assessed in lieu of suspension or revocation, may make written  application in duplicate to the Assistant Commissioner to reopen the  case and have the order of suspension or revocation or monetary penalty  assessment set aside or modified on the ground that new evidence has  been discovered or on the ground that important evidence is now  available which could not be produced at the original hearing by the  exercise of due diligence. The application must set forth the precise  character of the evidence to be relied upon and must state the reasons  why the applicant was unable to produce it when the original charges  were heard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. The Assistant Commissioner will forward the  application, together with his recommendation for action thereon, to the  Secretary of Homeland Security, or his designee. The Secretary may grant  or deny the application to reopen the case and may order the taking of  additional testimony before the Assistant Commissioner. The Assistant  Commissioner will notify the applicant of the Secretary's decision. If  the Secretary grants the application and orders a hearing, the Assistant  Commissioner will set a time and place for the hearing and give due  written notice of the hearing to the applicant. The procedures governing  the new hearing and recommended decision of the hearing officer will be  the same as those governing the original proceeding. The original order  of the Secretary will remain in effect pending conclusion of the new  proceedings and issuance of a new order under Sec. 111.77.</p>
