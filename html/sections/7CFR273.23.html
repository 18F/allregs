                                Sec. 273.23  Simplified application and standardized benefit projects.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. This subpart establishes rules under which Simplified  Application and Standardized Benefit Projects shall operate. State  agencies and political subdivisions chosen as project operators may  designate households containing members receiving TANF, SSI, or Medicaid  benefits as project eligible. Project eligible households shall have  their food stamp eligibility determined using simplified application  procedures. Food stamp eligibility shall be determined using information  contained in their TANF, or Medicaid application, or, in the case of  SSI, on the State Data Exchange (SDX) tape, and any appropriate  addendum. Project-eligible households shall be considered categorically  food stamp resource eligible based on their eligibility for these other  programs and shall be required to meet food stamp income eligibility  standards. However, income definitions appropriate to the TANF, SSI or  Medicaid programs shall be used instead of food stamp income definitions  in determining eligibility. In addition, such households shall, as a  condition of program eligibility, meet and/or fulfill all food stamp  nonfinancial eligibility requirements. (Project-eligible households  defined as categorically eligible in Sec. 273.2 (j) and (k) of these  regulations are not required to meet the income eligibility standards.)  To further simplify program administration, benefits provided to such  households may be standardized by category of assistance and household  size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program administration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Simplified application and  standardized benefit procedures are applicable in five States and five  political subdivisions. For the purpose of this section, a political  subdivision is a project area as defined in Sec. 271.2 of these  regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State agencies and political subdivisions seeking to operate a  Simplified Application and Standardized   Benefit Project shall submit Work Plans to FNS in accordance with the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FNS shall evaluate Work Plans according to the criteria set  forth in the Simplified Application/Standardized Benefit Notice of  Intent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Political subdivisions shall submit their Work Plans to FNS  through their respective State agencies for review and approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A State agency selected by FNS to operate a Simplified  Application and Standardized Benefit Project shall include the Work Plan  in its State Plan of Operations. A political subdivision chosen to  operate a Simplified Application and Standardized Benefit Project shall  assure that the responsible State agency include that political  subdivision's project Work Plan in its own State Plan of Operations. The  Work Plan shall be updated, as needed, to reflect changes in the benefit  methodology, subject to prior FNS approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of the work plan. The Work Plan submitted by each  applicant shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Background information on the proposed site's characteristics,  current operating procedures, and a general description of the proposed  procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the proposed project design, including the  benefit methodology, households which will be project eligible,  operational procedures, and the need for waivers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An implementation and monitoring plan describing tasks, staffing  and a timetable for implementation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An estimate of project impacts including implementation costs  and, on an annual basis, operating costs, administrative costs, error  reduction, and benefit changes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement signed by the State official with authority to  commit the State or political subdivisions to the project's operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Project-eligible households. Each operating agency shall decide  which of the following categories of household shall be eligible to  participate in the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Households all of whose members receive TANF benefits under part  A of title IV of the Social Security Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Households all of whose members receive SSI benefits under title  XVI of the Social Security Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Households all of whose members receive Medicaid benefits under  title XIX of the Social Security Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Households each of whose members receive one or more of the  following: TANF, SSI, or Medicaid benefits (multiple-benefit  households); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Households only some of whose members receive TANF, SSI, and/or  Medicaid benefits (mixed households).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determining Food Stamp Program eligibility. Under the Simplified  Application and Standardized Benefit Project, project eligible  households shall have their food stamp eligibility determined using the  following criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certain households, at the operating agency's option, which  contain members receiving TANF, SSI, or Medicaid benefits, shall be  designated project eligible and need not make separate application for  food stamp benefits. Once such households indicate in writing a desire  to receive food stamps, their eligibility will be determined based on  information contained in their application for TANF or Medicaid benefits  or, in the case of SSI, on the State Data Exchange (SDX) tape. TANF or  Medicaid applications may need to be modified, or be subject to an  addendum in order to accommodate any additional information required by  the operating agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The income definitions and resource requirements prescribed  under Sec. 273.9 (b) and (c) and Sec. 273.8 are inapplicable to project- eligible households. Project-eligible households which have met the  resource requirements of the TANF, SSI, and/or Medicaid programs shall  be considered to have satisfied the food stamp resource requirements.  Gross income less any allowed exclusions, as defined by the appropriate  categorical aid program, shall be used to determine food stamp income  eligibility (unless the project household is categorically income  eligible as defined in Sec. 273.2 (j) and (k)) and benefit levels.  Deemed income, as defined under TANF, SSI or Medicaid rules, shall be  excluded to the extent that households with such income are part   of the food stamp household providing the deemed income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Project-eligible households which are not categorically income  eligible shall meet the gross and net income standards prescribed in  Sec. 273.9(a). Net income shall be determined by subtracting from gross  income either actual or standardized deduction amounts. If standardized  deduction amounts are used, they may be initially determined using  recent historical data on deductions claimed by such households. Such  deductions must be updated, as necessary, on at least an annual basis.  Such deductions shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The current standard deduction for all households;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An excess shelter deduction and a dependent care deduction for  households not containing an elderly or disabled member;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A dependent care deduction, an uncapped excess shelter  deduction and a medical deduction for households containing a qualified  elderly or disabled member; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A standardized or actual earned income deduction for households  containing members with earned income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All non-financial food stamp eligibility requirements shall be  applicable to project-eligible households.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Benefit levels. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In establishing benefits for project  eligible households, either the appropriate State standard of need  (maximum aid payment) or gross income as determined for the appropriate  categorical aid program plus the value of any monetary categorical  benefits received, if any, may be used as the gross income amount. If  mixed households are designated project eligible, procedures shall be  developed to include as household income the income of those household  members not receiving categorical aid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If allotments are standardized, the average allotment for each  category of household, by household size, shall be no less than average  allotments would have been were the project not in operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Benefit methodologies shall be constructed to ensure that  benefits received by households having higher than average allotments  under normal program rules are not significantly reduced as a result of  standardization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Benefit methodologies shall be structured to ensure that  decreases in household benefits are not reduced by more than $10 or 20%,  whichever is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The methodology to be used in developing benefit levels shall be  determined by the operating agency but shall be subject to FNS approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> With FNS approval, operating agencies may develop an alternate  methodology for standardizing allotments/deductions for specific sizes  and categories of households where such size and category is so small as  to make the use of average deductions and/or allotments impractical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> FNS may require operating agencies to revise their standardized  allotments during the course of the project to reflect changes in items  such as household characteristics, the Thrifty Food Plan, deduction  amounts, the benefit reduction rate, or benefit levels in TANF or SSI.  Such changes will be documented by revising the Work Plan amendment to  the State Plan of Operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Household notification. All certified project-eligible  households residing in the selected project sites shall be provided with  a notice, prior to project commencement, informing them of the revised  procedures and household requirements under the project. If household  allotments are to be standardized, the notice shall also provide  specific information on the value of the newly computed benefit and the  formula used to calculate the benefit. The notice shall meet the  requirements of a notice of adverse action as set forth in  Sec. 273.13(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Application processing procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operating agency  shall allow project-eligible households to indicate in writing their  desire to receive food stamps. Such households shall be notified in  writing, at the time such indication is made, that information contained  in their TANF, SSI, or Medicaid application will be the basis of their  food stamp eligibility determination. If mixed households are included  in the project-eligible universe, the project operator shall develop a  procedure to collect the necessary information on   household members not receiving categorical aid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The operating agency may use simplified application and  standardized benefit procedures only for those households containing at  least one member certified to receive either TANF, SSI, or Medicaid  benefits. If simplified procedures are to be used, the State agency  shall make all eligibility determinations for households jointly  applying for food stamps and TANF, SSI, or Medicaid benefits within the  30-day food stamp processing period. If a household's eligibility for  TANF, SSI, or Medicaid cannot be established within the 30-day period,  normal food stamp application, certification, and benefit determination  procedures shall be used and benefits shall be issued within 30 days if  the household is eligible. Households which are jointly applying for  TANF, SSI, or Medicaid, and which qualify for expedited service, shall  be certified for food stamps using procedures prescribed at  Sec. 273.2(i). However, if the State agency can process the application  of an expedited service household for categorical assistance within the  expedited period prescribed at Sec. 273.2(i), it may use simplified  application and standardized benefit procedures to certify the household  for food stamp benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Regulatory requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All Food Stamp Program regulations  shall remain in effect unless they are expressly altered by the  provisions of this section or the provisions contained within the  approved SA/SB Work Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification periods for mixed households. At the option of the  operating agency, mixed households may be assigned certification periods  of up to one year. Such households, if circumstances warrant, may be  required to attend a face-to-face interview on a schedule which would  conform to certification periods normally assigned such households as  specified in Sec. 273.10(f). At the time of the interview, the household  shall be required to complete a modified application and provide  additional information in accordance with Sec. 273.2(f). If the  household fails to comply with the interview review requirement or if  information obtained indicates a revision in household eligibility or  benefits, action will be taken in accordance withSec. 273.13, Notice of  Adverse Action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Quality control. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Project eligible households selected for  quality control review shall be reviewed by the State agency using  special procedures, based on project requirements, which have been  developed by the State agency and approved by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The error rate(s) determined using the special quality control  review procedures shall be included when determining the State agency's  overall error rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Funding. Operating agencies shall be reimbursed for project  costs at the rates prescribed in Sec. 277.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Evaluation. Each project site shall conduct a self-evaluation of  the project's impact on benefits, administrative costs and  participation. Such evaluation shall be conducted within three months of  project implementation. The results of the self-evaluation shall be sent  to FNS within six months of project implementation. The impact of the  project on project-eligible households' error rates shall be reported on  an annual basis in accordance with Sec. 273.23(m).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Reporting requirements. Operating agencies shall be required to  prepare and submit to FNS an annual report on the error rate  attributable to project-eligible households. The timing of such reports  shall coincide with the due date for the annual quality control report  prescribed in Sec. 275.21(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> State agency monitoring. Monitoring shall be undertaken to  ensure compliance with these regulations and the Work Plan submitted to  and approved by FNS. Project monitoring shall be conducted in accordance  with the appropriate sections of part 275, Performance Reporting System,  of these regulations. At a minimum, onsite reviews of the Simplified  Application and Standardized Benefit Project shall be conducted once  within six months of the project's implementation and then in accordance  with the Management Evaluation review schedule for the project area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Termination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS may terminate project operations for any  reason and at any time on 60 days written notice to the administering  State agency or political subdivision. State or local   agencies may also choose to terminate their participation with 60 days  written notice to FNS. In either such event, operating agencies shall be  given sufficient time to return to normal operations in an orderly  fashion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If termination occurs, FNS may select another site for project  operations. Such selection shall be based on either previously received  project proposals or proposals received under a new solicitation.  [53 FR 26224, July 12, 1988]</p>
