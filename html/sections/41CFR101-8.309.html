                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. No handicapped person shall, because a recipient's  facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be  denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or be  subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives  Federal assistance from GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accessibility. A recipient shall operate any program or activity  to which this subpart applies so that when each part is viewed in its  entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.  This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing  facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by  handicapped persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methods. A recipient may comply with the requirement of  paragraph (a)   of this section through such means as acquisition or redesign of  equipment, such as telecommunications devices or other telephonic  devices for the hearing impaired; reassignment of classes or other  services to alternate sites which have accessible buildings; assignment  of aides to beneficiaries, such as readers for the blind or qualified  sign language interpreters for the hearing impaired when appropriate;  home visits; delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at  alternate accessible sites; alterations of existing facilities and  construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of  Sec. 101-8.310; or any other methods that result in making its program  or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not  required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other  methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this  section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement  of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to  those methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated  setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Small service providers. If a recipient with fewer than 15  employees finds, after consultation with a handicapped person seeking  its services, that there is no available method of complying with  paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration  in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer  the handicapped person to other providers of those services that are  accessible at no additional cost to the handicapped person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of  paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of  this subpart, except that where structural changes in facilities are  necessary, the changes are to be made as expeditiously as possible, but  in no event later than 3 years after the effective date of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to  facilities are necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of  this section, a recipient shall develop, within 6 months of the  effective date of this subpart, a transition plan setting forth the  steps necessary to complete the changes. The plan shall be developed  with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons  or organizations representing handicapped persons, and the plan must  meet with the approval of the Director of Civil Rights, GSA. A copy of  the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. At a  minimum, the plan shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that  limit the accessibility to and usability by handicapped persons of its  program or activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the  facilities accessible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve  full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and, if the time  period or the transition plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that  will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice. The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to  ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision  or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location  of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to, and  usable by, handicapped persons.</p>
