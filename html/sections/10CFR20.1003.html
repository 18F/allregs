Examples include negative pressure check, positive pressure check,  irritant smoke check, or isoamyl acetate check.</p><p class="depth2">Very high radiation area means an area, accessible to individuals,  in which radiation levels from radiation sources external to the body  could result in an individual receiving an absorbed dose in excess of  500 rads (5   grays) in 1 hour at 1 meter from a radiation source or 1 meter from any  surface that the radiation penetrates.</p><p class="depth2">Note: At very high doses received at high dose rates, units of  absorbed dose (e.g., rads and grays) are appropriate, rather than units  of dose equivalent (e.g., rems and sieverts)).</p><p class="depth2">Waste means those low-level radioactive wastes containing source,  special nuclear, or byproduct material that are acceptable for disposal  in a land disposal facility. For the purposes of this definition, low- level radioactive waste means radioactive waste not classified as high- level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or  byproduct material as defined in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of the  definition of Byproduct material set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth2">Week means 7 consecutive days starting on Sunday.</p><p class="depth2">Weighting factor wT, for an organ or tissue (T) is the  proportion of the risk of stochastic effects resulting from irradiation  of that organ or tissue to the total risk of stochastic effects when the  whole body is irradiated uniformly. For calculating the effective dose  equivalent, the values of wT are:</p><p class="depth2">Organ Dose Weighting Factors ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Organ or tissue                             wT ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Gonads.........................................................     0.25 Breast.........................................................     0.15 Red bone marrow................................................     0.12 Lung...........................................................     0.12 Thyroid........................................................     0.03 Bone surfaces..................................................     0.03 Remainder......................................................      \1\</p><p class="depth2">0.30 Whole Body.....................................................      \2\</p><p class="depth2">1.00 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ 0.30 results from 0.06 for each of 5 ``remainder'' organs (excluding</p><p class="depth2">the skin and the lens of the eye) that receive the highest doses. \2\ For the purpose of weighting the external whole body dose (for</p><p class="depth2">adding it to the internal dose), a single weighting factor, wT=1.0,</p><p class="depth2">has been specified.
