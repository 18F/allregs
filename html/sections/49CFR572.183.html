                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The neck assembly consists of parts shown in drawing 175-2000.  For purposes of this test, the neck is mounted within the headform  assembly 175-9000 as shown in Figure U1 in appendix A to this subpart.  When subjected to tests procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this  section, the neck-headform assembly shall meet performance requirements  specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soak the neck-headform assembly in a test  environment as specified in Sec. 572.189(n);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Attach the neck-headform assembly to the part 572 subpart E  pendulum test fixture as shown in Figure U2-A in appendix A to this  subpart, so that the midsagittal plane of the neck-headform assembly is  vertical and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the pendulum  longitudinal centerline shown in Figure U2-A. Torque the half-spherical  screws (175-2004) located at either end of the neck assembly to 88  5 in-lbs using the neck compression tool (175- 9500) or equivalent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Release the pendulum from a height sufficient to allow it to  fall freely to achieve an impact velocity of 3.40.1 m/s measured at the center of the pendulum  accelerometer (Figure 22 as set forth in 49 CFR 572.33) at the time the  pendulum makes contact with the decelerating mechanism. The velocity- time history of the pendulum falls inside the corridor determined by the  upper and lower boundaries specified in Table 1 to paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allow the neck to flex without the neck-headform assembly making  contact with any object;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Time zero is defined in Sec. 572.189(j).</p><p class="depth3">Table 1 to Paragraph (a)--ES-2re Neck Certification Pendulum Velocity</p><p class="depth3">Corridor ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Upper boundary                       Lower boundary ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Velocity              Velocity</p><p class="depth3">Time (ms)                   (m/s)    Time (ms)    (m/s) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.0....................................       0.00        0.0      -0.05</p><p class="depth3">3.0....................................      -0.25        2.5     -0.375 14.0...................................      -3.20       13.5       -3.7</p><p class="depth3">17.0       -3.7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Performance criteria. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The pendulum deceleration pulse is to  be characterized in terms of decrease in velocity as determined by  integrating the filtered pendulum acceleration response from time-zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum rotation in the lateral direction of the reference  plane of the headform (175-9000) as shown in Figure U2-B in appendix A  to this subpart, shall be 49 to 59 degrees with respect to the  longitudinal axis of the pendulum occurring between 54 and 66 ms from  time zero. Rotation of the headform-neck assembly and the neck angle  with respect to the pendulum shall be measured with potentiometers  specified in Sec. 572.189(c), installed as shown in drawing 175-9000,  and calculated per procedure specified in Figure U2-B in appendix A to  this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The decaying headform rotation vs. time curve shall cross the  zero angle with respect to its initial position at time of impact  relative to the pendulum centerline between 53 ms to 88 ms after the  time the peak translation-rotation value is reached.
