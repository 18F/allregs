                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In addition to the general review requirements in 801.602-71,  contracting officers must obtain technical reviews from Acquisition  Resources Service staff of any proposed agreement that is unique, novel,  or unusual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contracting officers must obtain technical reviews from  Acquisition Resources Service staff of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documents relating to bonds (see FAR 28.102-1 and 28.203 through  28.203-5) as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An irrevocable letter of credit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A tripartite escrow agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An individual surety bond. (Note that the FAR at 28.203(f)  also requires legal review of the documents pledging the assets of an  individual surety.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposed novation and change-of-name agreements (see FAR Subpart  42.12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Solicitations or proposed contracts containing an economic price   adjustment clause (other than a pre-approved VA clause) based on a cost  index of material or labor (e.g., the urban consumer price index (CPI-U)  (see FAR 16.203-4(d)) or where one of the economic price adjustment  clauses specified in FAR 16.203-4 are used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Proposed multi-year contracts where the cancellation ceiling  exceeds 20 percent of the contract amount, regardless of the dollar  value of the proposed contract (see 817.105-1(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proposed solicitations where the contract term total of the  basic and option periods may exceed 5 years, regardless of the dollar  value of the proposed acquisition (see 817.204).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Proposed membership agreements in a group purchasing  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A proposed termination settlement or determination of amounts  due the contractor under a terminated contract that involves the  expenditure of $100,000 or more of Government funds. Acquisition  Resources Service staff shall obtain legal review (see 849.111-70).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Consignment agreements with an anticipated expenditure of  $250,000 or more per year (except for a consignment agreement  established under, and provided for in, a Federal Supply Schedule  contract).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting officers, including purchase card holders, must  obtain technical and legal review of all proposed contracts with hotels  or similar facilities for conferences or similar functions (e.g.,  training, meetings) where VA's commitment, expenditure, and liability  (combined) exceed $25,000. This dollar figure is based on the  combination of all direct costs to VA under the contract (e.g.,  conference rooms, audio-visual charges, refreshments, catering) and all  potential liability (e.g., room guarantee liability, cancellation  costs). Even if there is no direct cost to VA, if the proposed contract  includes a guarantee on room usage or a cancellation fee that could  potentially exceed $25,000, the proposed contract requires legal and  technical review. Signing a contract committing VA to hold a conference  at a particular hotel is a procurement and procurement laws and  regulations must be followed.</p>
