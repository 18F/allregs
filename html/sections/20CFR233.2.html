This percentage of the unreduced windfall benefit component shall be the amount of that component to which persons are entitled under the Railroad Retirement Act. In no event, however, shall the amount of the windfall benefit exceed the amount that would be payable under the Railroad Retirement Act without regard to this section.</p>
