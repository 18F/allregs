                                Sec.  1033.225  Amending applications for certification
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your application to include new or modified locomotive configurations, subject to the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we include new or modified locomotive configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this section. You must also amend your application if any changes occur with respect to any information that is included or should be included in your application. For example, you must

amend your application if you determine that your actual production variation for an adjustable parameter exceeds the tolerances specified in your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must amend your application before you take either of the following actions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add a locomotive configuration to an engine family. In this case, the locomotive added must be consistent with other locomotives in the engine family with respect to the criteria listed in Sec.  1033.230. For example, you must amend your application if you want to produce 12-cylinder versions of the 16-cylinder locomotives you described in your application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change a locomotive already included in an engine family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the locomotive's lifetime. For example, you must amend your application if you want to change a part supplier if the part was described in your original application and is different in any material respect than the part you described.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Modify an FEL for an engine family as described in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To amend your application for certification, send the relevant information to the Designated Compliance Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe in detail the addition or change in the locomotive model or configuration you intend to make.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended engine family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission-data locomotive is still appropriate for showing that the amended family complies with all applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the original emission-data locomotive for the engine family is not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified locomotive, include new test data showing that the new or modified locomotive meets the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your new or modified locomotive. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see Sec.  1033.920).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, you may start producing the new or modified locomotive anytime after you send us your amended application, before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section. However, if we determine that the affected locomotives do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the locomotives and may require you to recall the locomotives at no expense to the owner. Choosing to produce locomotives under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all locomotives that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days after we request it, you must stop producing the new or modified locomotives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in certain cases after the start of production. The changed FEL may not apply to locomotives you have already introduced into U.S. commerce, except as described in this paragraph (f). If we approve a changed FEL after the start of production, you must include the new FEL on the emission control information label for all locomotives produced after the change. You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in the following cases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may ask to raise your FEL for your engine family at any time. In your request, you must show that you will still be able to meet the emission standards as specified in subparts B and H of this part. If you amend your application by submitting new test data to include a newly added or modified locomotive, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, use the appropriate FELs with corresponding

production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part. In all other circumstances, you must use the higher FEL for the entire family to calculate emission credits under subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may ask to lower the FEL for your emission family only if you have test data from production locomotives showing that emissions are below the proposed lower FEL. The lower FEL applies only to engines or fuel-system components you produce after we approve the new FEL. Use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part.
