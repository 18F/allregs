                                Sec. 10.111  What should the employer do when an employee files an   impairment?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for employees covered by paragraph (d) of this section,  when an employee is disabled by a work-related injury and loses pay for  more than three calendar days, or has a permanent impairment or serious  disfigurement as described in 5 U.S.C. 8107, the employer shall furnish  the employee with Form CA-7 for the purpose of claiming compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the employee is receiving continuation of pay (COP), the  employer should give Form CA-7 to the employee by the 30th day of the  COP period and submit the form to OWCP by the 40th day of the COP  period. If the employee has not returned the form to the employer by the  40th day of the COP period, the employer should ask him or her to submit  it as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon receipt of Form CA-7 from the employee, or someone acting  on his or her behalf, the employer shall complete the appropriate  portions of the form. As soon as possible, but no more than five working  days after receipt from the employee, the employer shall forward the  completed Form CA-7 and any accompanying medical report to OWCP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Postal Service employees are not entitled to compensation or  continuation of pay for the waiting period, the first three days of  disability. Such employees may use annual leave, sick leave or leave  without pay during that period; however, if the disability exceeds 14  days, the employee may have their sick leave or annual leave reinstated  or receive pay for the time spent on leave without pay. This waiting  period does not apply to the provision of medical care, and days of time  loss for medical treatment only with no work-related disability do not  count as part of the waiting period. A Postal Service employee seeking  wage loss compensation for this period should utilize Form CA-7 to claim  such benefits.</p>
