                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statutory provision. Section 6(b)(4)(B) provides that the  requirements of section 6(b)(1) do not apply to public disclosure of  information ``in the course of or concerning a rulemaking proceeding  (which shall commence upon the publication of an advance notice of  proposed rulemaking or a notice of proposed rulemaking) * * * under this  Act.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. A rulemaking proceeding includes a  proceeding either to issue, to amend, or to revoke a rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The phrase ``in the course of'' refers to information disclosed  as part of the proceeding and may, therefore, include information  generated before the proceeding began and later presented as part of the  proceeding. A rulemaking proceeding ends once the Commission has  published the final rule or a notice of termination of the rulemaking in  the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The phrase ``concerning'' refers to information about the  proceeding itself both after the proceeding has begun and indefinitely  thereafter. Therefore, the Commission may publicly disclose information  that describes the substance, process and outcome of the proceeding. By  issuing opinions and public statements, the Commissioners, and the  presiding official, who act as decisionmakers, may also publicly explain  their individual votes and any decision rendered.</p>
