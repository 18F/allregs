                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior authorization should be obtained from the Secretary, or his authorized representative, before the institution of proceedings to partition the lands of deceased Osage allottees in which any interest is held by an Osage Indian not having a certificate of competency. Requests for authority to institute such partition proceedings shall contain a description of the lands involved, the names of the several owners and their respective interests and the reasons for such court action. Authorization may be given for the institution of partition proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction when it appears to the best interest of the Indians involved to do so and the execution of voluntary exchange deeds is impracticable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When it appears to the best interest of the Indians to do so, the Secretary's, or his authorized representative's, authorization to institute partition proceedings may require that title to the lands be quieted in the partition action in order that the deeds issued pursuant to the proceedings shall convey good and merchantable title to the grantee therein. (See section 6, 37 Stat. 87.)</p>
