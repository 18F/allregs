Except as otherwise indicated, the following definitions and special rules apply for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The rules of this section are subject to section 7874(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A former shareholder of a domestic corporation is any person that held stock in the domestic corporation before the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), including any person that holds stock in the domestic corporation both before and after the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A former partner of a domestic partnership is any person that held an interest in the domestic partnership before the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), including any person that holds an interest in the domestic partnership both before and after the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An interest in a partnership includes a capital or profits interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> References to properties held by a domestic corporation include properties held directly or indirectly by the domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The rules and principles of sections 701 through 777 shall be applied for purposes of determining a proportionate amount (or share) of properties held by a partnership (such as stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any reference to the acquisition of properties held by a domestic corporation (or a partnership) includes a direct or indirect acquisition of such properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In the case of an acquisition of stock of a domestic corporation or an interest in a partnership, the proportionate amount of properties held by the domestic corporation (or the partnership) that is treated as indirectly acquired shall, as applicable, be determined at the time of the acquisition based on the relative value of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The stock acquired compared to all outstanding stock of the domestic corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest acquired compared to all interests in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The determination of whether a foreign corporation is a surrogate foreign corporation is made after the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i). A foreign corporation that is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation (including a surrogate foreign corporation treated as a domestic corporation described in section 7874(b)) shall continue to be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation (or a

domestic corporation), even if the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii) are not satisfied at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acquisition of properties--(1) Indirect acquisition of properties. For purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), an indirect acquisition of properties held by a domestic corporation (or a partnership) includes, but is not limited to, the acquisitions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. An acquisition of less than all of the stock of a domestic corporation (or interests in a partnership) shall constitute an indirect acquisition of a proportionate amount of the properties held by the domestic corporation or the partnership. See paragraph (b)(8) of this section for rules determining the proportionate amount of properties indirectly acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indirect acquisition of properties. For purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), an indirect acquisition of properties held by a domestic corporation (or a partnership) includes, but is not limited to, the acquisitions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. An acquisition of less than all of the stock of a domestic corporation (or interests in a partnership) shall constitute an indirect acquisition of a proportionate amount of the properties held by the domestic corporation or the partnership. See paragraph (b)(8) of this section for rules determining the proportionate amount of properties indirectly acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An acquisition of stock of a domestic corporation. See Example 1 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An acquisition of an interest in a partnership. See Example 2 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An acquisition by a corporation (acquiring corporation) of properties held by a domestic corporation (or a partnership) in exchange for stock of a foreign corporation (foreign issuing corporation) that is part of the expanded affiliated group that includes the acquiring corporation after the acquisition shall be treated as an acquisition by the foreign issuing corporation. See Example 3 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (c)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An acquisition by a partnership (acquiring partnership) of properties held by a domestic corporation (or a partnership) in exchange for stock of a foreign corporation that is part of the expanded affiliated group that would include the acquiring partnership after the acquisition (if the partnership were a corporation) shall be treated as an acquisition by the foreign issuing corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition of stock of a foreign corporation. An acquisition of stock of a foreign corporation that owns directly or indirectly stock of a domestic corporation (or an interest in a partnership) shall not constitute an indirect acquisition of any properties held by the domestic corporation (or the partnership). See Example 4 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Downstream transactions. An acquisition by a corporation of its stock from another corporation or a partnership (for example, as a result of a downstream merger) is an acquisition of the other corporation's or partnership's properties for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Acquisitions by multiple foreign corporations. If, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions), two or more foreign corporations complete, in the aggregate, an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), then each foreign corporation shall be treated as completing the acquisition for purposes of determining whether such foreign corporation is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation. See Examples 5 and 6 of paragraph (k) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acquisitions of multiple domestic entities. If, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions), a foreign corporation completes two or more acquisitions described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) involving domestic corporations and/or domestic partnerships (domestic entities), then, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), the acquisitions shall be treated as a single acquisition and the domestic entities shall be treated as a single domestic entity. If the transaction involves one or more domestic corporations and one or more domestic partnerships, the stock of the foreign corporation held by former shareholders and former partners by reason of holding stock or a partnership interest in the domestic entities shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the ownership condition of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) is satisfied. See Example 7 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Stock held by reason of holding stock in a domestic corporation or an interest in a domestic partnership--(1) Specified transactions. For purposes of section

7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), stock of a foreign corporation that is held by reason of holding stock in a domestic corporation (or an interest in a domestic partnership) includes, but is not limited to, the stock described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Specified transactions. For purposes of section

7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), stock of a foreign corporation that is held by reason of holding stock in a domestic corporation (or an interest in a domestic partnership) includes, but is not limited to, the stock described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock of a foreign corporation received in exchange for, or with respect to, stock of a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stock of a foreign corporation received in exchange for, or with respect to, an interest in a domestic partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent that paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section does not apply, stock of a foreign corporation received by a domestic partnership in exchange for all or part of its properties. In such a case, each partner in the domestic partnership shall be treated as holding its proportionate share of the stock of the foreign corporation by reason of holding an interest in the domestic partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions involving other property--(i) Stock of a domestic corporation. If, pursuant to the same transaction, stock of a foreign corporation is received in exchange for, or with respect to, stock of a domestic corporation and other property, the stock of the foreign corporation that was received in exchange for, or with respect to, the stock of the domestic corporation shall be determined based on the relative value of the stock of the domestic corporation compared to the aggregate value of such stock and the other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock of a domestic corporation. If, pursuant to the same transaction, stock of a foreign corporation is received in exchange for, or with respect to, stock of a domestic corporation and other property, the stock of the foreign corporation that was received in exchange for, or with respect to, the stock of the domestic corporation shall be determined based on the relative value of the stock of the domestic corporation compared to the aggregate value of such stock and the other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest in a domestic partnership. If, pursuant to the same transaction, stock of a foreign corporation is received in exchange for, or with respect to, an interest in a domestic partnership and other property, the stock of the foreign corporation that was received in exchange for, or with respect to, the interest in the domestic partnership shall be determined based on the relative value of the interest in the domestic partnership compared to the aggregate value of such interest and the other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> See Examples 8 through 10 of paragraph (k) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Publicly traded foreign partnerships--(1) Treatment as a foreign corporation. For purposes of section 7874, a publicly traded foreign partnership described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be treated as a foreign corporation that is organized in the foreign country in which, or under the law of which, the publicly traded foreign partnership was created or organized, and the partnership interests in the publicly traded foreign partnership shall be treated as stock of the foreign corporation. For purposes of determining whether the foreign corporation shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, a deemed acquisition of assets and liabilities by reason of Sec. 1.708-1(b)(4) shall not constitute an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment as a foreign corporation. For purposes of section 7874, a publicly traded foreign partnership described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be treated as a foreign corporation that is organized in the foreign country in which, or under the law of which, the publicly traded foreign partnership was created or organized, and the partnership interests in the publicly traded foreign partnership shall be treated as stock of the foreign corporation. For purposes of determining whether the foreign corporation shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, a deemed acquisition of assets and liabilities by reason of Sec. 1.708-1(b)(4) shall not constitute an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Publicly traded foreign partnership. A publicly traded foreign partnership described in this paragraph (g)(2) is any foreign partnership that would, but for section 7704(c), be treated as a corporation under section 7704(a)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At any time after the acquisition pursuant to a plan that existed at the time of the acquisition. For this purpose, a plan shall be deemed to exist at the time of the acquisition if the foreign partnership would, but for section 7704(c), be treated as a corporation under section 7704(a) at any time during the two-year period following the completion of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Surrogate foreign corporation to which section 7874(b) applies. If paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies to a publicly traded foreign partnership and the foreign corporation is a surrogate foreign corporation to which section 7874(b) applies, the publicly traded foreign partnership shall be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). See paragraph (g)(6) of this section for the timing and treatment of the conversion of the publicly traded foreign partnership to a domestic corporation. See Example 11 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (g)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Surrogate foreign corporation to which section 7874(b) does not apply. If paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies to a publicly traded foreign partnership

and the foreign corporation is a surrogate foreign corporation to which section 7874(b) does not apply, the publicly traded foreign partnership shall continue to be treated as a foreign partnership for purposes of the Code, but section 7874(a)(1) shall apply to any expatriated entity (as defined in section 7874(a)(2)(A)). See Example 13 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (g)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Foreign corporation not treated as a surrogate foreign corporation. If paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies to a publicly traded foreign partnership and the foreign corporation is not treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, the status of the publicly traded foreign partnership as a foreign partnership shall not be affected by section 7874. See Example 12 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (g)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Conversion to a domestic corporation. Except for purposes of determining whether the publicly traded foreign partnership is a surrogate foreign corporation, if paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies to a publicly traded foreign partnership and the foreign corporation is a surrogate foreign corporation to which section 7874(b) applies, then at the later of the end of the day immediately preceding the first date properties are acquired as part of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) or immediately after the formation of the publicly traded foreign partnership, the publicly traded foreign partnership shall be treated as transferring all of its assets and liabilities to a newly formed domestic corporation in exchange solely for stock of the domestic corporation, and then distributing such stock to its partners in proportion to their partnership interests in liquidation of the partnership. The treatment of the transfer of assets and liabilities to the domestic corporation and the distribution of the stock of the domestic corporation to the partners in liquidation of the partnership shall be determined under all relevant provisions of the Code and general tax principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Options--(1) Value. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (h), for purposes of section 7874, including for purposes of determining the membership of an expanded affiliated group under section 7874(c)(1), an option with respect to a corporation or partnership will be treated as stock in the corporation, or an interest in the partnership, as applicable, with a value equal to the holder's claim on the equity of the corporation or partnership. For this purpose, claim on the equity equals the value of the stock or partnership interest that may be acquired pursuant to the option, less the exercise price (but in no case is a claim on the equity less than zero). Also for this purpose, the equity of the corporation or partnership shall not include the amount of any property the holder of the option would be required to provide to the corporation or partnership under the terms of the option if such option were exercised. See Example 14 and Example 16 of paragraph (k) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (h)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Value. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (h), for purposes of section 7874, including for purposes of determining the membership of an expanded affiliated group under section 7874(c)(1), an option with respect to a corporation or partnership will be treated as stock in the corporation, or an interest in the partnership, as applicable, with a value equal to the holder's claim on the equity of the corporation or partnership. For this purpose, claim on the equity equals the value of the stock or partnership interest that may be acquired pursuant to the option, less the exercise price (but in no case is a claim on the equity less than zero). Also for this purpose, the equity of the corporation or partnership shall not include the amount of any property the holder of the option would be required to provide to the corporation or partnership under the terms of the option if such option were exercised. See Example 14 and Example 16 of paragraph (k) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (h)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Voting power. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (h), for purposes of determining the voting power of a foreign corporation under section 7874, including for purposes of determining the membership of an expanded affiliated group under section 7874(c)(1), an option will be treated as exercised only if a principal purpose of the issuance or transfer of the option is to avoid the foreign corporation being treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing. For purposes of this paragraph (h), the value of the holder's claim on the equity is determined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership, immediately before the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a foreign corporation or foreign partnership, immediately after the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain options disregarded. The rules of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall not apply to an option if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A principal purpose of the issuance or acquisition of the option is to avoid the foreign corporation being treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), the

probability of the option being exercised is remote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Options and interests similar to an option. For purposes of this paragraph (h), an option includes an interest similar to an option. Examples of options (including interests similar to options) include, but are not limited to, a warrant, a convertible debt instrument, an instrument other than debt that is convertible into stock or a partnership interest, a put, stock or a partnership interest subject to risk of forfeiture, a contract to acquire or sell stock or a partnership interest, and an exchangeable share or exchangeable partnership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Multiple claims on equity. Paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall not apply to an option to the extent treating the option as stock or a partnership interest would duplicate a shareholder's or partner's claim on the equity of the corporation or partnership by reason of holding stock in the corporation or an interest in the partnership. See Example 15 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (h)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interests treated as stock of a foreign corporation--(1) Stock or other interests. If the conditions of paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied, then, for purposes of section 7874, any interest (including stock or a partnership interest) that is not otherwise treated as stock of a foreign corporation (including under paragraph (h) of this section) shall be treated as stock of the foreign corporation. See Examples 17 and 18 of paragraph (k) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (i)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Stock or other interests. If the conditions of paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied, then, for purposes of section 7874, any interest (including stock or a partnership interest) that is not otherwise treated as stock of a foreign corporation (including under paragraph (h) of this section) shall be treated as stock of the foreign corporation. See Examples 17 and 18 of paragraph (k) of this section for illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (i)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The interest provides the holder distribution rights that are substantially similar in all material respects to the distribution rights provided by stock in the foreign corporation. For this purpose, distribution rights include rights to dividends (or partnership distributions), distributions in redemption of the interest (in whole or in part), distributions in liquidation, or other similar distributions that represent a return on, or of, the holder's investment in the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treating the interest as stock of the foreign corporation has the effect of treating the foreign corporation as a surrogate foreign corporation under section 7874(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Creditor claims--(i) Domestic corporation. For purposes of section 7874, if, immediately prior to the first date properties are acquired as part of an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), a domestic corporation is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)), or the liabilities of the domestic corporation exceed the value of its assets, then each creditor of the domestic corporation shall be treated as a shareholder of the domestic corporation and any claim of the creditor against the domestic corporation shall be treated as stock of the domestic corporation. See Example 19 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (i)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Domestic corporation. For purposes of section 7874, if, immediately prior to the first date properties are acquired as part of an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), a domestic corporation is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)), or the liabilities of the domestic corporation exceed the value of its assets, then each creditor of the domestic corporation shall be treated as a shareholder of the domestic corporation and any claim of the creditor against the domestic corporation shall be treated as stock of the domestic corporation. See Example 19 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (i)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Domestic or foreign partnership. For purposes of section 7874, if, immediately prior to the first date properties are acquired as part of an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), a partnership (foreign or domestic) is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)), or the liabilities of the partnership exceed the value of its assets, then each creditor of the partnership shall be treated as a partner in the partnership and any claim of the creditor against the partnership shall be treated as an interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of creditor as shareholder or partner. A creditor that is treated as a shareholder or partner under paragraph (i)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall be treated as a shareholder or partner for all purposes of section 7874. See, for example, Sec. 1.7874-1(c) and paragraph (f) of this section. See Example 19 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (i)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Application of section 7874(b)--(1) Conversion to a domestic corporation. Except for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, the conversion of a foreign corporation to a domestic corporation by reason of section 7874(b) shall constitute a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) that occurs at the later of

the end of the day immediately preceding the first date properties are acquired as part of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) or immediately after the formation of the foreign corporation. See, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.367(b)-2 and 1.367(b)-3 for certain consequences of the reorganization. The treatment of all other aspects of the conversion shall be determined under the relevant provisions of the Code and general tax principles. See Example 20 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (j)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conversion to a domestic corporation. Except for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, the conversion of a foreign corporation to a domestic corporation by reason of section 7874(b) shall constitute a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) that occurs at the later of

the end of the day immediately preceding the first date properties are acquired as part of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) or immediately after the formation of the foreign corporation. See, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.367(b)-2 and 1.367(b)-3 for certain consequences of the reorganization. The treatment of all other aspects of the conversion shall be determined under the relevant provisions of the Code and general tax principles. See Example 20 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (j)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Entity classification. A foreign corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b) is not an eligible entity as defined in Sec. 301.7701-3(a), and therefore may not elect to be classified as other than an association (and thus cannot be treated as other than a corporation) for Federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of section 367. If a foreign corporation is treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b), section 367 shall not apply to any transfer of property by a United States person to such foreign corporation as part of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i). However, section 367 shall apply to the conversion of the foreign corporation to a domestic corporation. See paragraph (j)(1) of this section. See Example 20 of paragraph (k) of this section for an illustration of the rules of this paragraph (j)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Examples--(1) Assumed facts.

Further, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring 40% of the properties held by DC1 on the date of the acquisition of the partnership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

Further, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FP is also treated as acquiring 100% of the properties held by DC1 on the date of the stock acquisition.

Pursuant to the same plan, the shareholders of DC1 transfer all of their DC1 stock equally to F1, F2, F3, and F4 in exchange solely for stock of each foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, in the aggregate F1, F2, F3, and F4 are treated as acquiring substantially all of the properties held by DC1. Because the acquisition was pursuant to the same plan, under paragraph (d) of this section, F1, F2, F3, and F4 are each treated as acquiring substantially all of the properties held by DC1 for purposes of determining whether each foreign corporation shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DC1. DC1 forms F1, F2, F3, and F4, and transfers an equal portion of its properties to each corporation in exchange solely for stock of the corporation. Pursuant to the same plan DC1 then distributes the stock of each foreign corporation to individual A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Because pursuant to the same plan F1, F2, F3, and F4 acquired, in the aggregate, substantially all of the properties held by DC1, under paragraph (d) of this section, F1, F2, F3, and F4 are each treated as acquiring substantially all of the properties held by DC1 for purposes of determining whether each foreign corporation shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DC1, and individual B wholly owns DC2. Pursuant to the same plan, individuals A and B transfer all of their DC1 stock and DC2 stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for all 100 shares of FA stock outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring all of the properties held by DC1 and DC2 on the date of the stock acquisition. Under paragraph (e) of this section, because pursuant to the same plan FA acquired substantially all of the properties held by DC1 and DC2, for purposes of determining whether FA shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, DC1 and DC2 shall be treated as a single domestic corporation, of which individuals A and B are former shareholders. Thus, individuals A and B are treated as holding all 100 shares of the FA stock by reason of holding stock of such domestic corporation, and the ownership fraction under section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) is 100/100, or 100%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DC1 and F1. DC1 has a $40x value and F1 has a $60x value. Individual A transfers all of the DC1 stock and F1 stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(2)(i) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), individual A is considered to hold 40% of the FA stock by reason of holding stock in DC1 ($100x FA stock multiplied by $40x/$100x, the relative value of the DC1 stock to all the property transferred by A to FA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Pursuant to a divisive reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), DC1 contributes substantially all of its properties to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for FA stock and then distributes the FA stock to its shareholders in a transaction qualifying under section 355.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), the FA stock received by the DC1 shareholders as a distribution with respect to the DC1 stock is considered held by reason of holding stock in DC1. The result would be the same if the transaction did not qualify as a reorganization (for example, if the distribution were subject to sections 301 and 311(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individuals A and B equally own DPS. DPS transfers substantially all of its properties constituting a trade or business to FA, a newly formed corporation, solely in exchange for FA stock. DPS retains the FA stock after the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), individuals A and B are treated as holding a proportionate amount (that is, an equal amount) of the FA stock held by DPS by reason of holding an interest in DPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Pursuant to a plan, DC1 and individual B organize a limited liability company (HPS) under the law of Country A. DC1 owns 90% of the membership interests in HPS, and B owns 10% of the membership interests in HPS. HPS is a foreign eligible entity under Sec. 301.7701-2, and DC1 and B make an election under Sec. 301.7701-3 to treat HPS as a partnership for Federal tax purposes as of the date of the formation of HPS. HPS forms DC2. One day after the formation of HPS, DC2 merges with and into DC1. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the DC1 shareholders exchange their DC1 stock solely for membership interests in HPS. After the merger HPS wholly owns DC1, and the former shareholders of DC1 own a greater than 80% interest in HPS by reason of holding stock of DC1. Public trading of the HPS ownership interests begins the day after the date on which

the merger is completed. HPS is not treated as a corporation under section 7704(a) by reason of section 7704(c). If HPS were a corporation, the condition of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(iii) would be satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. HPS is a publicly traded foreign partnership that is described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, HPS is treated as a foreign corporation organized under the law of Country A and the membership interests in HPS are treated as stock of the foreign corporation. The foreign corporation is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation under section 7874(a)(2)(B) because, pursuant to the merger, HPS acquired substantially all of the properties held by DC1, the former shareholders of DC1 hold at least 60% of the stock of the foreign corporation by reason of holding stock of DC1, and the expanded affiliated group that includes the foreign corporation does not have substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total business activities of the expanded affiliated group. Further, because the former shareholders of DC1 hold at least 80% of the stock of the foreign corporation by reason of holding stock of DC1, section 7874(b) applies to the surrogate foreign corporation, and therefore HPS is treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of the Code. Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, except for purposes of determining whether HPS is a surrogate foreign corporation, at the end of the day immediately preceding the date of the merger of DC2 with and into DC1, HPS is treated as transferring all of its assets and liabilities to a new domestic corporation in exchange solely for stock of the domestic corporation. HPS is then treated as proportionately distributing such stock to its membership interest holders in liquidation of the partnership. In addition, as a result of the merger of DC2 with and into DC1, the former shareholders of DC1 shall be treated as receiving stock of a domestic corporation in exchange for their DC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 11 of this section, except that, after the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that includes HPS (treated as a foreign corporation for this purpose) has substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total business activities of the expanded affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, HPS is treated as a foreign corporation and the membership interests in HPS are treated as stock of the foreign corporation. However, the foreign corporation is not treated as a surrogate foreign corporation under section 7874(a)(2)(B) because, after the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that includes HPS has substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total business activities of the expanded affiliated group. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(5) of this section, section 7874 does not apply and the status of HPS as a foreign partnership is not affected. In addition, DC1 is not treated as an expatriated entity under section 7874(a) by reason of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FPS is a publicly traded foreign partnership organized in Country A that, by reason of section 7704(c), is not treated as a corporation under section 7704(a). FPS acquires all the stock of DC1 in exchange for partnership interests in FPS. After the acquisition, the former shareholders of DC1 hold a 75%-interest in FPS by reason of holding DC1 stock. After the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that includes FPS (treated as a foreign corporation for this purpose) does not have substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total business activities of the expanded affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, FPS is treated as a foreign corporation and the partnership interests in FPS are treated as stock of the foreign corporation. FPS is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation because the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) are satisfied. However, because the former shareholders of DC1 hold less than an 80%-interest in FPS by reason of holding DC1 stock, section 7874(b) does not apply to FPS. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section FPS continues to be treated as a foreign partnership for purposes of the Code, but section 7874(a)(1) applies to DC1 and any other expatriated entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DC1. DC1 has a $200x value. Individual B wholly owns FA. The value of B's FA stock is $400x. Individual C holds a warrant to acquire FA stock from FA at an exercise price of $20x. Individual A transfers all of its DC1 stock to FA in exchange solely for FA stock with a value of $200x. At the time of the transfer, the FA stock that individual C can acquire pursuant to the warrant has a $70x value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (h)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, individual C is treated as owning FA stock with a $50x value. This amount represents individual C's claim on the equity of FA after the acquisition ($70x value of FA stock that may be acquired pursuant to the warrant, less the $20x exercise price), without taking into account the $20x individual C would be required to provide to FA upon the exercise of the warrant. Thus, for purposes of section 7874, the value of the stock of FA immediately after the transaction is $650x ($600x

of FA stock, plus C's $50x claim on the equity of FA). C's warrant is not taken into account for purposes of determining the voting power of FA under section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 14 except that, instead of holding a warrant issued by FA, individual C holds an option to acquire FA stock from individual B for an exercise price of $20x. At the time of the acquisition, the FA stock that individual C can acquire under the option has a $70x value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, individual C is not treated as owning FA stock by reason of holding the option because treating the option as FA stock would have the effect of partially duplicating individual B's claim on the equity of FA at the time of the acquisition by reason of holding FA stock. However, all of the FA stock owned by individual B will be taken into account for purposes of section 7874. C's warrant is not taken into account for purposes of determining voting power of FA under section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A DC1 employee holds a warrant to acquire DC1 stock from DC1. In connection with the acquisition by FA of substantially all of the properties held by DC1, the DC1 employee receives a warrant from FA to acquire 15 shares of FA stock in exchange for the warrant to acquire DC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (h)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, the warrant held by the DC1 employee is treated as DC1 stock with a value equal to the employee's claim on the equity of DC1 immediately before the acquisition. Further, for purposes of section 7874, the DC1 employee is treated as holding FA stock with a value equal to the employee's claim on the equity of FA after the acquisition by reason of holding the warrant to acquire DC1 stock (treated as DC1 stock for this purpose). The option held by the DC1 employee is not taken into account for purposes of determining the voting power of FA under section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. (A) Individuals A and B equally own DC1. FA, a newly formed corporation, issues stock in a public offering for cash. FA contributes part of the cash from the public offering to DC2, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for all the stock of DC2. DC2 merges with and into DC1 with DC1 surviving. Pursuant to the merger agreement, individuals A and B exchange their DC1 stock for cash and shares of class B stock of DC1. Following the merger FA owns all the class A stock of DC1. FA does not hold significant assets other than the class A stock of DC1. Individuals A and B own all the class B stock of DC1. DC1 has no other class of stock outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individuals A and B equally own DC1. FA, a newly formed corporation, issues stock in a public offering for cash. FA contributes part of the cash from the public offering to DC2, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for all the stock of DC2. DC2 merges with and into DC1 with DC1 surviving. Pursuant to the merger agreement, individuals A and B exchange their DC1 stock for cash and shares of class B stock of DC1. Following the merger FA owns all the class A stock of DC1. FA does not hold significant assets other than the class A stock of DC1. Individuals A and B own all the class B stock of DC1. DC1 has no other class of stock outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The class B stock entitles individuals A and B to dividend distributions approximately equal to any dividend distributions made by FA with respect to its publicly traded stock. In certain circumstances, the class B stock also permits individuals A and B to require DC1 to redeem the stock at fair market value. The class B stock does not provide individuals A and B voting rights with respect to FA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The dividend rights provided by the class B stock are substantially similar in all material respects to the dividend rights provided by the FA stock. In addition, because FA does not hold significant assets other than the class A stock, the value of the class B stock held by individuals A and B is approximately equal to the value of a corresponding amount of publicly traded FA stock. The distribution rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the class B stock, therefore, are substantially similar in all material respects to the distribution rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the FA stock. As a result, the distribution rights provided by the class B stock are substantially similar in all material respects to the distribution rights provided by the publicly traded FA stock. Thus, if treating the class B stock as FA stock would have the effect of treating FA as a surrogate foreign corporation, under paragraph (i)(1) of this section the class B stock will be treated as FA stock for purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. (A) Individuals A and B equally own DC1. FA, a newly formed corporation, issues stock in a public offering for cash. Individuals A and B and FA organize FPS. FA transfers part of the cash from the public offering to FPS in exchange for a class A partnership interest. FA does not hold any significant assets other than the class A partnership interest. Individuals A and B transfer their DC1 stock to FPS in exchange for class B partnership interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individuals A and B equally own DC1. FA, a newly formed corporation, issues stock in a public offering for cash. Individuals A and B and FA organize FPS. FA transfers part of the cash from the public offering to FPS in exchange for a class A partnership interest. FA does not hold any significant assets other than the class A partnership interest. Individuals A and B transfer their DC1 stock to FPS in exchange for class B partnership interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The class B partnership interests entitle individuals A and B to cash distributions from FPS approximately equal to any dividend distributions made by FA with respect to its publicly traded stock. In certain circumstances, the class B partnership interests also permit individuals A and B to require FPS to redeem the interests in exchange for cash equal to the value of an amount of FA stock as determined on the redemption date. The class B partnership interests do not provide individuals A or B voting rights with respect to FA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The non-liquidating distribution rights provided by the class B partnership interests are substantially similar in all

material respects to the dividend rights provided by the FA stock. Because FA does not hold any significant assets other than the class A partnership interest, the value of the class B partnership interests held by individuals A and B is approximately equal to a corresponding amount of FA stock. The distribution rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the class B partnership interests, therefore, are substantially similar in all material respects to distribution rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the FA stock. Thus, the distribution rights provided by the class B partnership interests are substantially similar in all material respects to the distribution rights provided by the publicly traded FA stock. As a result, if treating the class B partnership interests as FA stock would have the effect of treating FA as a surrogate foreign corporation, under paragraph (i)(1) of this section the class B partnership interests will be treated as FA stock for purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individuals A and B equally own DC1. The liabilities of DC1 exceed the value of its assets. Pursuant to a plan, FA, a newly formed corporation, acquires substantially all of the properties held by DC1 in exchange solely for FA stock. Pursuant to the plan, the DC1 stock held by individuals A and B is cancelled, and the creditors of DC1 receive all the FA stock in exchange for their claims against DC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Because immediately before the first date on which properties are acquired as part of the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) the liabilities of DC1 exceed the value of its assets, under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, the creditors of DC1 are treated as shareholders of DC1 and the creditors' claims against DC1 are treated as DC1 stock. Therefore, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), the FA stock received by the creditors of DC1 by reason of their claims against DC1 is considered held by former shareholders of DC1 by reason of holding DC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individuals A and B are United States persons and equally own DC1. Pursuant to a plan, individuals A and B transfer their DC1 stock to FA in exchange solely for 80% of the outstanding FA stock. After the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that includes FA does not have substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total business activities of the expanded affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring all of the properties held by DC1 on the date of the stock acquisition. After the acquisition, the former shareholders of DC1 own 80% of the stock of FA by reason of holding DC1 stock. Therefore, FA is a surrogate foreign corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b). Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, except for purposes of determining whether FA is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, the conversion of FA to a domestic corporation constitutes a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) that occurs at the end of the day immediately preceding the date of the stock acquisition. Section 367 applies to the conversion of FA to a domestic corporation. See, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.367(b)-2 and 1.367(b)-3 for the consequences of the conversion. Under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, section 367 does not apply to the transfers of DC1 stock by individuals A and B to FA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective/applicability date.

A group asset is considered to be located in the relevant foreign country only if the asset was physically present in such country at the close of the acquisition date and for more time than in any other country during the testing period. All group assets must be valued consistently and on a gross basis (that is, not reduced by liabilities) using either the adjusted tax basis or fair market value determined in U.S. dollars translated, if necessary, at the spot rate determined under the principles of Sec. 1.988-1(d)(1), (2), and (4). Tangible personal property or real property that is

rented by members of the expanded affiliated group from a person other than a member of the expanded affiliated group is also treated as a group asset, provided such property is used in the active conduct of a trade or business and is being rented by members of the expanded affiliated group at the close of the acquisition date. For purposes of this section, a group asset that is rented is valued at eight times the net annual rent paid or accrued with respect to the property by members of the expanded affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The term group employees means employees of members of the expanded affiliated group.

Sec. 1.7874-4T  Disregard of certain stock related to the acquisition(temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section identifies certain stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that is disregarded in determining the ownership fraction (as defined in paragraph (i)(9) of this section) and modifies the scope of section 7874(c)(2)(B). Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the general rule that certain stock of the foreign acquiring corporation, and only such stock, is treated as stock described in section 7874(c)(2)(B) and therefore is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction. Paragraph (c) of this section identifies the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that is subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a de minimis exception to the application of the general exclusion rule of paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section addresses transfers of stock of

the foreign acquiring corporation involving certain obligations. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for certain transfers of stock of the foreign acquiring corporation involving multiple properties or obligations. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules for the treatment of partnerships, and paragraph (h) of this section provides rules addressing the interaction of this section with the expanded affiliated group rules of section 7874(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.7874-1. Paragraph (i) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (j) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the rules of this section. Paragraph (k) of this section provides dates of applicability, and paragraph (l) of this section provides the date of expiration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion of disqualified stock under section 7874(c)(2)(B). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, disqualified stock (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) is treated as stock described in section 7874(c)(2)(B) and therefore is not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Section 7874(c)(2)(B) shall not apply to exclude stock from the denominator of the ownership fraction that is not disqualified stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disqualified stock--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, disqualified stock is stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that is transferred in an exchange described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section that is related to the acquisition. This paragraph (c) applies without regard to whether the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation is publicly traded at the time of the transfer or at any other time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, disqualified stock is stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that is transferred in an exchange described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section that is related to the acquisition. This paragraph (c) applies without regard to whether the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation is publicly traded at the time of the transfer or at any other time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Exchange for nonqualified property. The stock is transferred to a person other than the domestic entity in exchange for nonqualified property. See Example 1, Example 2, Example 5, Example 7, and Example 8 of paragraph (j) of this section for illustrations of this paragraph (c)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain obligations associated with property exchanged for stock. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), the stock is transferred to a person in exchange for property and, pursuant to the same plan (or series of related transactions), the transferee subsequently transfers such stock in exchange for the satisfaction or the assumption of one or more obligations associated with the property exchanged. An obligation is associated with property exchanged if, for example, the obligation arose from the conduct of a trade or business in which the property exchanged has been used, regardless of whether the obligation is a non-recourse obligation. If any of the property exchanged constitutes nonqualified property and the transferee is not the domestic entity, the amount of stock described in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) is limited to the product of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fair market value of the stock subsequently transferred by the transferee in exchange for the satisfaction or the assumption of such obligations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of qualified property exchanged by the transferee, and the denominator of which is the total amount of property exchanged by the transferee. See Example 5 of paragraph (j) of this section for an illustration of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock transferred in an exchange that does not increase the fair market value of the assets or decrease the amount of liabilities of the foreign acquiring corporation. Stock is disqualified stock only to the extent that the transfer of the stock in the exchange increases the fair market value of the assets of the foreign acquiring corporation or decreases the amount of its liabilities. This paragraph (c)(2) is applied to an exchange without regard to any other exchange described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section or any other transaction related to the acquisition. See Example 3 and Example 6 of paragraph (j) of this section for illustrations of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exception to exclusion of disqualified stock--(1) De minimis ownership. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if both:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> De minimis ownership. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if both:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The ownership percentage described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), determined without regard to the application of paragraph (b) of this section, is less than five percent (by vote and value); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After the acquisition and all transactions related to the acquisition, if any, are completed, former shareholders (within the meaning of Sec. 1.7874-2(b)(2)) or former partners (within the meaning of Sec. 1.7874-2(b)(3)), as applicable, in the aggregate, own (applying the attribution rules of section 318(a) with the modifications described in section 304(c)(3)(B)) less than five percent (by vote and value) of the stock of (or a partnership interest in) any member of the expanded affiliated group that includes the foreign acquiring corporation. See Example 4 of paragraph (j) of this section for an illustration of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stock issued to avoid the purposes of section 7874. The exception in paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply to disqualified stock that is transferred in a transaction (or series of transactions) related to the acquisition with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Satisfaction or assumption of obligations. Except to the extent paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section applies, this paragraph (e) applies if, in a transaction related to the acquisition, stock of the foreign acquiring corporation is transferred to a person other than the domestic entity in exchange for the satisfaction or the assumption of one or more obligations of the transferor. In such a case, solely for purposes of this section, the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation is treated as if it is transferred in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Transactions involving multiple properties. For purposes of this section, if stock and other property are exchanged for qualified property and nonqualified property, the stock is treated as transferred in exchange for the qualified property or nonqualified property, respectively, based on the relative value of the property. See also Sec. 1.7874-2(f)(2) (allocating stock of the foreign acquiring corporation between an interest in the domestic entity and other property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Treatment of partnerships. For purposes of this section, if one or more members of the expanded affiliated group own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent (by value) of the interests in a partnership, such partnership is treated as a corporation that is a member of the expanded affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Interaction with expanded affiliated group rules. Disqualified stock that is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is taken into account for purposes of determining whether an entity is a member of the expanded affiliated group for purposes of applying section 7874(c)(2)(A) and determining whether an acquisition qualifies as an internal group restructuring or results in a loss of control, as described in Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(2) and (c)(3), respectively. However, such disqualified stock is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) regardless of whether it would otherwise be included in the denominator of the ownership fraction as a result of the application of Sec. 1.7874-1(c). See Example 7 and Example 8 of paragraph (j) of this section for illustrations of this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An acquisition is an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A domestic entity is a domestic corporation or domestic partnership described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An expanded affiliated group is an affiliated group defined in section 7874(c)(1) determined as of the end of the day on which the acquisition is completed.

the acquisition, unless a principal purpose for acquiring such stock or partnership interest is to avoid the purposes of section 7874.

The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of the examples, unless otherwise indicated, assume the following facts in addition to the facts stated in the examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> FA, FMS, FS, and FT are foreign corporations, all of which have only one class of stock issued and outstanding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DMS and DT are domestic corporations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> P and R are corporations that may be either domestic or foreign;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> PRS is a partnership with individual partners;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The de minimis ownership exception in paragraph (d)(1) of this section does not apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> None of the shareholders or partners in the entities described in the examples are related persons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> All transactions described in each example occur pursuant to the same plan; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> No property is acquired with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT. PRS transfers marketable securities (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(6) of this section) to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for 25 shares of FA stock. Then Individual A transfers all the DT stock to FA in exchange solely for 75 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (i)(6) and (i)(7)(ii) of this section, the marketable securities constitute nonqualified property. Accordingly, the 25 shares of FA stock transferred by FA to PRS in exchange for the marketable securities constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the marketable securities increases the fair market value of the assets of FA by the fair market value of the marketable securities transferred. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25 shares of FA stock transferred to PRS are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Accordingly, the only FA stock included in the ownership fraction is the FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange for the DT stock, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT. PRS transfers

marketable securities (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(6) of this section) to FT, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for all the FT stock. Then PRS transfers the FT stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for 25 shares of FA stock. Finally, Individual A transfers all the DT stock to FA in exchange solely for 75 shares of FA stock. FA acquires the FT stock with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(iv) of this section, the FT stock constitutes nonqualified property because a principal purpose of FA acquiring the FT stock is to avoid the purposes of section 7874. Accordingly, the 25 shares of FA stock transferred by FA to PRS in exchange for the FT stock constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the FT stock increases the fair market value of FA's assets by the fair market value of the FT stock. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25 shares of FA stock transferred to PRS are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Accordingly, the only FA stock included in the ownership fraction is FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange for the DT stock, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FT, a publicly traded corporation, forms FA, and then FA forms DMS and FMS. FMS merges with and into FT, with FT surviving the merger (FMS-FT merger). Pursuant to the FMS-FT merger, the FT shareholders exchange their FT stock solely for 1,000 shares of FA stock and FT becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of FA. Following the FMS-FT merger, DMS merges with and into DT, also a publicly traded corporation, with DT surviving the merger (DMS-DT merger). Pursuant to the DMS-DT merger, the DT shareholders exchange their DT stock solely for the remaining 1,000 shares of FA stock, and DT becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of FA. After the completion of the plan, FA wholly owns FT and DT, DMS and FMS cease to exist, and the stock of FA is publicly traded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Because FT becomes a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA in a transaction related to FA's acquisition of substantially all the properties of DT, the FT stock does not constitute marketable securities (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(6) of this section) and therefore does not constitute nonqualified property pursuant to paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, no FA stock is disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and therefore the FA stock transferred in exchange for the FT stock and DT stock is included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 1,000/2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3, except that, instead of undertaking the FMS-FT merger, FT merges with and into FA with FA surviving the merger (FT-FA merger). Pursuant to the FT-FA merger, the FT shareholders exchange their FT stock solely for 1,000 shares of FA stock. At the time of the FT-FA merger, FT does not hold nonqualified property and has no obligations. Accordingly, FA stock transferred by FA to FT in exchange for the property of FT is not disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Furthermore, the 1,000 shares of FA stock transferred by FT to the shareholders of FT in exchange for their FT stock do not constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Although the FT stock is nonqualified property (the FT stock constitutes marketable securities within the meaning of paragraph (i)(7)(ii) of this section because the stock of FT is publicly traded and FT is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA after the acquisition), under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the transfer of FA stock by FT to the shareholders of FT neither increases the fair market value of the assets of FA nor decreases the liabilities of FA. Accordingly, no FA stock is disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and, therefore, the FA stock transferred in exchange for the assets of FT and the DT stock is included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 1,000/2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT. The fair market value of the DT stock is $100x. PRS transfers $96x of cash to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for 96 shares of FA stock. Then Individual A transfers the DT stock to FA in exchange for $96x of cash and 4 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section, cash constitutes nonqualified property. Accordingly, the 96 shares of FA stock transferred by FA to PRS in exchange for $96x of cash constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Furthermore, paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for $96x of cash increases the fair market value of the assets of FA by $96x. However, without regard to the application of paragraph (b) of this section,

the ownership percentage described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be less than 5% (by vote and value), or 4% (4/100, or 4 shares of FA stock held by Individual A by reason of owning the DT stock, determined under Sec. 1.7874-2(f)(2), over 100 shares of FA stock outstanding after the acquisition). Furthermore, after the acquisition and all transactions related to the acquisition, Individual A owns less than 5% (by vote and value) of the stock of FA and DT (the members of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA). Accordingly, the de minimis exception in paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies and therefore paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to exclude the FA stock transferred to PRS from the denominator of the ownership fraction. Therefore, the FA stock transferred to Individual A and PRS is included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 4/100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT. The stock of DT held by Individual A has a fair market value of $75x. Individual A also holds an obligation of DT with a value and face amount of $25x. DT holds property with a value of $100x, and the $25x obligation is associated with the property. FA, a newly formed corporation, transfers 100 shares of FA stock to Individual A in exchange for all the DT stock and the $25x obligation of DT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(iii)(A) of this section, the $25x obligation of DT constitutes nonqualified property because DT is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA. Thus, the shares of FA stock transferred by FA to Individual A in exchange for the obligation of DT constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Under Sec. 1.7874-2(f)(2), Individual A is treated as receiving 75 shares of FA stock in exchange for the DT stock (100 x $75x/$100x) and 25 shares of FA stock in exchange for the obligation of DT (100 x $25x/$100x). Thus, 25 shares of FA stock constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock for the $25x obligation increases the fair market value of FA's assets by $25x. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25 shares of FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange for the obligation of DT are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Accordingly, the only FA stock included in the ownership fraction is the 75 shares of FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange for the DT stock, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 5, except that instead of acquiring the stock of DT and the $25x obligation of DT, FA acquires the $100x of property from DT in exchange solely for 100 shares of FA stock. DT distributes 75 shares of FA stock to Individual A in exchange for Individual A's DT stock and transfers 25 shares of FA stock to Individual A in satisfaction of DT's obligation to Individual A, and liquidates. The 25 shares of FA stock used to satisfy DT's obligation to Individual A after being transferred by FA to DT in exchange for the property of DT constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the property of DT increases the fair market value of FA's assets by $100x (although the amount of disqualified stock is limited to 25 shares of FA stock in this case). Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25 shares of FA stock that constitute disqualified stock are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Accordingly, only 75 shares of FA stock are included in the ownership fraction, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT. Individual B holds all 100 outstanding shares of FA stock. Individual C acquires 20 shares of FA stock from Individual B for cash, and then FA acquires all of the stock of DT from Individual A in exchange solely for 100 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section, cash constitutes nonqualified property. Accordingly, absent the application of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the 20 shares of FA stock transferred by Individual B to Individual C in exchange for cash would constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Nevertheless, because Individual B's sale of FA stock neither increases the assets of FA nor decreases the liabilities of FA, such FA stock is not disqualified stock by reason of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Accordingly, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to Individual B's sale of the 20 shares of FA stock to Individual C, and that FA stock is included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. The 100 shares of FA stock received by Individual A are the only shares included in the numerator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 100/200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P holds 85 shares of DT stock. The remaining 15 shares of DT stock are held by Individual A. P and Individual A transfer their shares of DT stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 85 and 15 shares of FA stock, respectively, and PRS transfers $75x of cash to FA in exchange for the remaining 75 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section, cash constitutes nonqualified property. Accordingly, the 75 shares of FA stock transferred by FA to PRS in exchange for $75x of cash constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Furthermore, paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for $75x of cash increases the fair market value of the assets of FA by $75x. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the 75 shares of FA stock transferred to PRS are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Although PRS's shares of FA stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction under paragraph (b) of this section, such shares of FA stock nonetheless are taken into account for purposes of determining whether P is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA under paragraph (h) of this section. Because P holds 48.6% of the FA stock (85/175) after the acquisition, it is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA. In addition, the acquisition does not qualify as an internal group restructuring described in Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(2) because P does not hold, directly or indirectly, 80% or more of the shares of FA stock (by vote and value) after the acquisition. Therefore, the FA stock held by P (along with the FA stock held by Individual A) is included in the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 100/100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P wholly owns DT. P transfers all of its shares of DT stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 49 shares of FA stock, and R transfers marketable securities (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(6) of this section) to FA in exchange for the remaining 51 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (i)(6) and (i)(7)(ii) of this section, the marketable securities constitute nonqualified property. Accordingly, the shares of FA stock transferred by FA to R in exchange for the marketable securities constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the marketable securities increases the fair market value of the assets of FA by the fair market value of the marketable securities transferred. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the shares of FA stock transferred to R are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Although under paragraph (b) of this section R's shares of FA stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction, under paragraph (h) of this section such stock is taken into account for purposes of determining whether P or R is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA. Because P holds 49% of the shares of FA stock (49/100), P is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA, and P's FA stock is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Because R holds 51% of the shares of FA stock (51/100), R is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA and, before taking into account Sec. 1.7874-1(c), R's FA stock would be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the ownership fraction under section 7874(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.7874-1(b). However, the acquisition results in a loss of control described in Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(2) because P does not hold, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of FA stock (by vote or value) of R, FA, or DT after the acquisition. Accordingly, the FA stock held by R would be included in the denominator of the ownership fraction under Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(1). Nevertheless, the FA stock held by R is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction under paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section. Thus, the ownership fraction is 49/49.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 8, except that, in exchange for 51 shares of FA stock, R transfers marketable securities (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(6) of this section) with a value equal to that of 16 shares of FA stock and qualified property (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(7) of this section) with a value equal to that of 35 shares of FA stock. Accordingly, 16 of the 51 shares of FA stock transferred to R constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and 35 of such shares do not constitute disqualified stock. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the marketable securities increases the fair market value of the assets of FA by the fair market value of the marketable securities transferred. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, 16 of the 51 shares of FA stock transferred to R are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Although 16 of the 51 shares of FA stock that

are transferred to R are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction, under paragraph (h) of this section, all 51 of R's shares of FA stock are taken into account for purposes of determining whether P or R is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA. Because P holds 49% of the shares of FA stock (49/100), it is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA, and its FA stock is included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Because R holds 51% of the shares of FA stock (51/100), it is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA and, before taking into account Sec. 1.7874-1(c), its FA stock is excluded from the numerator and denominator of the ownership fraction under section 7874(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.7874-1(b). However, the acquisition results in a loss of control described in Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(2) because P does not hold, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of FA stock (by vote or value) of R, FA, or DT after the acquisition. Accordingly, the 51 shares of FA stock held by R would be included in the denominator of the ownership fraction under Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(1). Nevertheless, the 16 shares of FA stock that constitute disqualified stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction under paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section. In addition, the 35 shares of FA stock received by R that do not constitute disqualified stock are included in the denominator. Thus, the ownership fraction is 49/84.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effective/applicability dates--(1) General rule.

Sec. 1.7874-5T  Effect of certain transfers of stock related to theacquisition (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Stock of a foreign corporation that is described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) shall not cease to be so described as a result of any subsequent transfer of the stock by the former shareholder (within the meaning of Sec. 1.7874-2(b)(2)) or former partner (within the meaning of Sec. 1.7874-2(b)(3)) that received such stock, even if the subsequent transfer is related to the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The rule of this section is illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT, a domestic corporation. FA, a newly formed foreign corporation, acquires all of the stock of DT from Individual A in exchange solely for 100 shares of FA stock. Pursuant to a binding commitment that was entered into in connection with FA's acquisition of the DT stock, Individual A sells 25 shares of FA stock to B, an unrelated person, in exchange for cash. For federal income tax purposes, the form of the steps of the transaction is respected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under Sec. 1.7874-2(f)(1), the 100 shares of FA stock received by Individual A are stock of a foreign corporation (FA) that is held by reason of holding stock in a domestic corporation (DT). Accordingly, such stock is described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii). Under paragraph (a) of this section, all 100 shares of FA stock retain their status as being described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), even though Individual A sells 25 of the 100 shares in connection with the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) pursuant to

the binding commitment. Therefore, all 100 of the shares of FA stock are included in both the numerator and denominator of the ownership fraction (as defined in Sec. 1.7874-4T(i)(9)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective/applicability dates. This section applies to acquisitions that are completed on or after January 16, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Expiration date. The applicability of this section expires on January 13, 2017.
