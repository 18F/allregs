                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)(B)(i)</em>. Paragraph (f) of this  section provides rules to identify the stock of a foreign corporation  that is held by reason of holding stock in a domestic corporation (or an  interest in a domestic partnership). Paragraph (g) of this section  provides rules that treat certain publicly traded foreign partnerships  as foreign corporations for purposes of section 7874. Paragraph (h) of  this section provides rules concerning the treatment of certain options  (or similar interests) for purposes of section 7874. Paragraph (i) of  this section provides rules that treat certain interests (including  debt, stock, or a partnership interest) as stock of a foreign  corporation for purposes of section 7874. Paragraph (j) of this section  provides rules concerning the conversion of a foreign corporation to a  domestic corporation by reason of section 7874(b). Paragraph (k) of this  section provides examples that illustrate the rules of this section.  Paragraph (l) of this section provides the effective/applicability date  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions and special rules. Except as otherwise indicated,  the following definitions and special rules apply for purposes of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The rules of this section are subject to section 7874(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(B)(i)</em>, including any person that holds  stock in the domestic corporation both before and after the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A former partner of a domestic partnership is any person that  held an interest in the domestic partnership before the acquisition  described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), including any person that holds  an interest in the domestic partnership both before and after the  acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An interest in a partnership includes a capital or profits  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> References to properties held by a domestic corporation include  properties held directly or indirectly by the domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The rules and principles of sections 701 through 777 shall be  applied for purposes of determining a proportionate amount (or share) of  properties held by a partnership (such as stock).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any reference to the acquisition of properties held by a  domestic corporation (or a partnership) includes a direct or indirect  acquisition of such properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> In the case of an acquisition of stock of a domestic corporation  or an interest in a partnership, the proportionate amount of properties  held by the domestic corporation (or the partnership) that is treated as  indirectly acquired shall, as applicable, be determined at the time of  the acquisition based on the relative value of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The stock acquired compared to all outstanding stock of the  domestic corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The interest acquired compared to all interests in the  partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The determination of whether a foreign corporation is a  surrogate foreign corporation is made after the acquisition described in  section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i). A foreign corporation that is treated as a  surrogate foreign corporation (including a surrogate foreign corporation  treated as a domestic corporation described in section 7874(b)) shall  continue to be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation (or a   domestic corporation), even if the conditions of section  7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii) are not satisfied at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section. An acquisition of  less than all of the stock of a domestic corporation (or interests in a  partnership) shall constitute an indirect acquisition of a proportionate  amount of the properties held by the domestic corporation or the  partnership. See paragraph (b)(8) of this section for rules determining  the proportionate amount of properties indirectly acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An acquisition by a partnership (acquiring partnership) of  properties held by a domestic corporation (or a partnership) in exchange  for stock of a foreign corporation that is part of the expanded  affiliated group that would include the acquiring partnership after the  acquisition (if the partnership were a corporation) shall be treated as  an acquisition by the foreign issuing corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Downstream transactions. An acquisition by a corporation of its  stock from another corporation or a partnership (for example, as a  result of a downstream merger) is an acquisition of the other  corporation's or partnership's properties for purposes of section  7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock of a foreign corporation received in exchange for, or with  respect to, stock of a domestic corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stock of a foreign corporation received in exchange for, or  with respect to, an interest in a domestic partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent that paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section does  not apply, stock of a foreign corporation received by a domestic  partnership in exchange for all or part of its properties.

If, pursuant to the same transaction, stock of a foreign  corporation is received in exchange for, or with respect to, stock of a  domestic corporation and other property, the stock of the foreign  corporation that was received in exchange for, or with respect to, the  stock of the domestic corporation shall be determined based on the  relative value of the stock of the domestic corporation compared to the  aggregate value of such stock and the other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest in a domestic partnership. If, pursuant to the same  transaction, stock of a foreign corporation is received in exchange for,  or with respect to, an interest in a domestic partnership and other  property, the stock of the foreign corporation that was received in  exchange for, or with respect to, the interest in the domestic  partnership shall be determined based on the relative value of the  interest in the domestic partnership compared to the aggregate value of  such interest and the other property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> See Examples 8 through 10 of paragraph (k) of this section for  illustrations of the rules of this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Publicly traded foreign partnerships--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment as a foreign  corporation. For purposes of section 7874, a publicly traded foreign  partnership described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be  treated as a foreign corporation that is organized in the foreign  country in which, or under the law of which, the publicly traded foreign  partnership was created or organized, and the partnership interests in  the publicly traded foreign partnership shall be treated as stock of the  foreign corporation. For purposes of determining whether the foreign  corporation shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation, a  deemed acquisition of assets and liabilities by reason of Sec. 1.708- 1(b)(4) shall not constitute an acquisition described in section  7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> is any foreign  partnership that would, but for section 7704(c), be treated as a  corporation under section 7704(a)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At any time after the acquisition pursuant to a plan that  existed at the time of the acquisition. For this purpose, a plan shall  be deemed to exist at the time of the acquisition if the foreign  partnership would, but for section 7704(c), be treated as a corporation  under section 7704(a) at any time during the two-year period following  the completion of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Conversion to a domestic corporation. Except for purposes of  determining whether the publicly traded foreign partnership is a  surrogate foreign corporation, if paragraph (g)(1) of this section  applies to a publicly traded foreign partnership and the foreign  corporation is a surrogate foreign corporation to which section 7874(b)  applies, then at the later of the end of the day immediately preceding  the first date properties are acquired as part of the acquisition  described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i) or immediately after the formation  of the publicly traded foreign partnership, the publicly traded foreign  partnership shall be treated as transferring all of its assets and  liabilities to a newly formed domestic corporation in exchange solely  for stock of the domestic corporation, and then distributing such stock  to its partners in proportion to their partnership interests in  liquidation of the partnership. The treatment of the transfer of assets  and liabilities to the domestic corporation and the distribution of the  stock of the domestic corporation to the partners in liquidation of the  partnership shall be determined under all relevant provisions of the  Code and general tax principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Voting power. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this  paragraph (h), for purposes of determining the voting power of a foreign  corporation under section 7874, including for purposes of determining  the membership of an expanded affiliated group under section 7874(c)(1),  an option will be treated as exercised only if a principal purpose of  the issuance or transfer of the option is to avoid the foreign  corporation being treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing. For purposes of this paragraph (h), the value of the  holder's claim on the equity is determined--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a foreign corporation or foreign partnership,  immediately after the acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain options disregarded. The rules of paragraph (h)(1) of  this section shall not apply to an option if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A principal purpose of the issuance or acquisition of the option  is to avoid the foreign corporation being treated as a surrogate foreign  corporation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the acquisition described in section  7874(a)(2)(B)(i), the   probability of the option being exercised is remote.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Options and interests similar to an option. For purposes of this  paragraph (h), an option includes an interest similar to an option.  Examples of options (including interests similar to options) include,  but are not limited to, a warrant, a convertible debt instrument, an  instrument other than debt that is convertible into stock or a  partnership interest, a put, stock or a partnership interest subject to  risk of forfeiture, a contract to acquire or sell stock or a partnership  interest, and an exchangeable share or exchangeable partnership  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The interest provides the holder distribution rights that are  substantially similar in all material respects to the distribution  rights provided by stock in the foreign corporation. For this purpose,  distribution rights include rights to dividends (or partnership  distributions), distributions in redemption of the interest (in whole or  in part), distributions in liquidation, or other similar distributions  that represent a return on, or of, the holder's investment in the  interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treating the interest as stock of the foreign corporation has  the effect of treating the foreign corporation as a surrogate foreign  corporation under section 7874(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Domestic or foreign partnership. For purposes of section 7874,  if, immediately prior to the first date properties are acquired as part  of an acquisition described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), a partnership  (foreign or domestic) is in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in  section 368(a)(3)), or the liabilities of the partnership exceed the  value of its assets, then each creditor of the partnership shall be  treated as a partner in the partnership and any claim of the creditor  against the partnership shall be treated as an interest in the  partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Entity classification. A foreign corporation that is treated as  a domestic corporation under section 7874(b) is not an eligible entity  as defined in Sec. 301.7701-3(a), and therefore may not elect to be  classified as other than an association (and thus cannot be treated as  other than a corporation) for Federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Examples--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assumed facts. Except as otherwise stated, assume  the following for purposes of the examples included in paragraph (k)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> DC1 and DC2 are domestic corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FA, FP, F1, F2, F3, and F4 are foreign corporations organized  in Country A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> DPS is a domestic partnership that conducts a trade or  business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> FPS is a foreign partnership that is not publicly traded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under the terms of the partnership agreements of DPS and FPS,  each partner's share in the partnership's items of income, gain,  deduction, and loss is determined in accordance with the partner's  partnership interest percentage in the partnership, as stated in the  examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A, B, and C are unrelated individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Each entity has a single class of equity outstanding and is  unrelated to all other entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> All transactions are completed pursuant to a plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> All acquisitions of properties are completed after March 4,  2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Section 7874(c)(4) does not apply, and no option is issued or  acquired with a principal purpose to avoid a foreign corporation being  treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. FA acquires 25% of the outstanding stock of DC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for  purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring 25% of  the properties held by DC1 on the date of the stock acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. DPS  wholly owns DC1. FA acquires a 40% interest in DPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, for  purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring 40  percent of the DC1 stock held by DPS on the date of the acquisition of  the partnership interest. Further, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section, for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as  acquiring 40% of the properties held by DC1 on the date of the  acquisition of the partnership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. FP  wholly owns FA. FA acquires all the outstanding stock of DC1 in exchange  solely for FP stock. FP and FA are members of the same expanded  affiliated group after the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for  purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring 100% of  the properties held by DC1 on the date of the stock acquisition.  Further, under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, for purposes of  section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FP is also treated as acquiring 100% of the  properties held by DC1 on the date of the stock acquisition. The result  would be the same if instead FA had directly acquired all the properties  held by DC1 in exchange for FP stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  FP wholly owns DC1. FA acquires all of the outstanding stock of FP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for purposes  of section   7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is not treated as acquiring any properties held by  DC1 on the date of the acquisition of the FP stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Pursuant to the same plan, the shareholders of DC1 transfer  all of their DC1 stock equally to F1, F2, F3, and F4 in exchange solely  for stock of each foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, in the  aggregate F1, F2, F3, and F4 are treated as acquiring substantially all  of the properties held by DC1. Because the acquisition was pursuant to  the same plan, under paragraph (d) of this section, F1, F2, F3, and F4  are each treated as acquiring substantially all of the properties held  by DC1 for purposes of determining whether each foreign corporation  shall be treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DC1. DC1 forms F1, F2, F3, and F4,  and transfers an equal portion of its properties to each corporation in  exchange solely for stock of the corporation. Pursuant to the same plan  DC1 then distributes the stock of each foreign corporation to individual  A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Because pursuant to the same plan F1, F2, F3, and F4  acquired, in the aggregate, substantially all of the properties held by  DC1, under paragraph (d) of this section, F1, F2, F3, and F4 are each  treated as acquiring substantially all of the properties held by DC1 for  purposes of determining whether each foreign corporation shall be  treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  Individual A wholly owns DC1, and individual B wholly owns DC2. Pursuant  to the same plan, individuals A and B transfer all of their DC1 stock  and DC2 stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for  all 100 shares of FA stock outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> is 100/100, or 100%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  Individual A wholly owns DC1 and F1. DC1 has a $40x value and F1 has a  $60x value. Individual A transfers all of the DC1 stock and F1 stock to  FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, individual A is  considered to hold 40% of the FA stock by reason of holding stock in DC1  ($100x FA stock multiplied by $40x/$100x, the relative value of the DC1  stock to all the property transferred by A to FA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Pursuant to  a divisive reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), DC1  contributes substantially all of its properties to FA, a newly formed  corporation, in exchange solely for FA stock and then distributes the FA  stock to its shareholders in a transaction qualifying under section 355.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the FA stock received by the DC1  shareholders as a distribution with respect to the DC1 stock is  considered held by reason of holding stock in DC1. The result would be  the same if the transaction did not qualify as a reorganization (for  example, if the distribution were subject to sections 301 and 311(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. Individuals A and B equally own DPS. DPS transfers substantially  all of its properties constituting a trade or business to FA, a newly  formed corporation, solely in exchange for FA stock. DPS retains the FA  stock after the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, individuals A and B are treated  as holding a proportionate amount (that is, an equal amount) of the FA  stock held by DPS by reason of holding an interest in DPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Pursuant to a plan, DC1 and individual B  organize a limited liability company (HPS) under the law of Country A.  DC1 owns 90% of the membership interests in HPS, and B owns 10% of the  membership interests in HPS. HPS is a foreign eligible entity under  Sec. 301.7701-2, and DC1 and B make an election under Sec. 301.7701-3  to treat HPS as a partnership for Federal tax purposes as of the date of  the formation of HPS. HPS forms DC2. One day after the formation of HPS,  DC2 merges with and into DC1. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the DC1  shareholders exchange their DC1 stock solely for membership interests in  HPS. After the merger HPS wholly owns DC1, and the former shareholders  of DC1 own a greater than 80% interest in HPS by reason of holding stock  of DC1. Public trading of the HPS ownership interests begins the day  after the date on which   the merger is completed. HPS is not treated as a corporation under  section 7704(a) by reason of section 7704(c). If HPS were a corporation,  the condition of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(iii) would be satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. HPS is a publicly traded foreign partnership that is  described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Therefore, under  paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 7874, HPS is  treated as a foreign corporation organized under the law of Country A  and the membership interests in HPS are treated as stock of the foreign  corporation. The foreign corporation is treated as a surrogate foreign  corporation under section 7874(a)(2)(B) because, pursuant to the merger,  HPS acquired substantially all of the properties held by DC1, the former  shareholders of DC1 hold at least 60% of the stock of the foreign  corporation by reason of holding stock of DC1, and the expanded  affiliated group that includes the foreign corporation does not have  substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total  business activities of the expanded affiliated group. Further, because  the former shareholders of DC1 hold at least 80% of the stock of the  foreign corporation by reason of holding stock of DC1, section 7874(b)  applies to the surrogate foreign corporation, and therefore HPS is  treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of the Code. Under  paragraph (g)(6) of this section, except for purposes of determining  whether HPS is a surrogate foreign corporation, at the end of the day  immediately preceding the date of the merger of DC2 with and into DC1,  HPS is treated as transferring all of its assets and liabilities to a  new domestic corporation in exchange solely for stock of the domestic  corporation. HPS is then treated as proportionately distributing such  stock to its membership interest holders in liquidation of the  partnership. In addition, as a result of the merger of DC2 with and into  DC1, the former shareholders of DC1 shall be treated as receiving stock  of a domestic corporation in exchange for their DC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in  Example 11 of this section, except that, after the acquisition, the  expanded affiliated group that includes HPS (treated as a foreign  corporation for this purpose) has substantial business activities in  Country A when compared to the total business activities of the expanded  affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for purposes  of section 7874, HPS is treated as a foreign corporation and the  membership interests in HPS are treated as stock of the foreign  corporation. However, the foreign corporation is not treated as a  surrogate foreign corporation under section 7874(a)(2)(B) because, after  the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that includes HPS has  substantial business activities in Country A when compared to the total  business activities of the expanded affiliated group. Therefore, under  paragraph (g)(5) of this section, section 7874 does not apply and the  status of HPS as a foreign partnership is not affected. In addition, DC1  is not treated as an expatriated entity under section 7874(a) by reason  of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. FPS is a publicly traded foreign partnership organized in Country  A that, by reason of section 7704(c), is not treated as a corporation  under section 7704(a). FPS acquires all the stock of DC1 in exchange for  partnership interests in FPS. After the acquisition, the former  shareholders of DC1 hold a 75%-interest in FPS by reason of holding DC1  stock. After the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that  includes FPS (treated as a foreign corporation for this purpose) does  not have substantial business activities in Country A when compared to  the total business activities of the expanded affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for purposes  of section 7874, FPS is treated as a foreign corporation and the  partnership interests in FPS are treated as stock of the foreign  corporation. FPS is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation because  the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) are satisfied. However, because  the former shareholders of DC1 hold less than an 80%-interest in FPS by  reason of holding DC1 stock, section 7874(b) does not apply to FPS.  Therefore, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section FPS continues to be  treated as a foreign partnership for purposes of the Code, but section  7874(a)(1) applies to DC1 and any other expatriated entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DC1. DC1 has a $200x value.  Individual B wholly owns FA. The value of B's FA stock is $400x.  Individual C holds a warrant to acquire FA stock from FA at an exercise  price of $20x. Individual A transfers all of its DC1 stock to FA in  exchange solely for FA stock with a value of $200x. At the time of the  transfer, the FA stock that individual C can acquire pursuant to the  warrant has a $70x value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (h)(1) of this section, for purposes  of section 7874, individual C is treated as owning FA stock with a $50x  value. This amount represents individual C's claim on the equity of FA  after the acquisition ($70x value of FA stock that may be acquired  pursuant to the warrant, less the $20x exercise price), without taking  into account the $20x individual C would be required to provide to FA  upon the exercise of the warrant. Thus, for purposes of section 7874,  the value of the stock of FA immediately after the transaction is $650x  ($600x   of FA stock, plus C's $50x claim on the equity of FA). C's warrant is  not taken into account for purposes of determining the voting power of  FA under section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 14 except that, instead of  holding a warrant issued by FA, individual C holds an option to acquire  FA stock from individual B for an exercise price of $20x. At the time of  the acquisition, the FA stock that individual C can acquire under the  option has a $70x value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, for purposes  of section 7874, individual C is not treated as owning FA stock by  reason of holding the option because treating the option as FA stock  would have the effect of partially duplicating individual B's claim on  the equity of FA at the time of the acquisition by reason of holding FA  stock. However, all of the FA stock owned by individual B will be taken  into account for purposes of section 7874. C's warrant is not taken into  account for purposes of determining voting power of FA under section  7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A DC1 employee holds a warrant to acquire DC1 stock from DC1.  In connection with the acquisition by FA of substantially all of the  properties held by DC1, the DC1 employee receives a warrant from FA to  acquire 15 shares of FA stock in exchange for the warrant to acquire DC1  stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraphs (h)(1) of this section, for purposes  of section 7874, the warrant held by the DC1 employee is treated as DC1  stock with a value equal to the employee's claim on the equity of DC1  immediately before the acquisition. Further, for purposes of section  7874, the DC1 employee is treated as holding FA stock with a value equal  to the employee's claim on the equity of FA after the acquisition by  reason of holding the warrant to acquire DC1 stock (treated as DC1 stock  for this purpose). The option held by the DC1 employee is not taken into  account for purposes of determining the voting power of FA under section  7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individuals A and B equally own DC1.  FA, a newly formed corporation, issues stock in a public offering for  cash. FA contributes part of the cash from the public offering to DC2, a  newly formed corporation, in exchange for all the stock of DC2. DC2  merges with and into DC1 with DC1 surviving. Pursuant to the merger  agreement, individuals A and B exchange their DC1 stock for cash and  shares of class B stock of DC1. Following the merger FA owns all the  class A stock of DC1. FA does not hold significant assets other than the  class A stock of DC1. Individuals A and B own all the class B stock of  DC1. DC1 has no other class of stock outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The class B stock entitles individuals A and B to dividend  distributions approximately equal to any dividend distributions made by  FA with respect to its publicly traded stock. In certain circumstances,  the class B stock also permits individuals A and B to require DC1 to  redeem the stock at fair market value. The class B stock does not  provide individuals A and B voting rights with respect to FA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The dividend rights provided by the class B stock are  substantially similar in all material respects to the dividend rights  provided by the FA stock. In addition, because FA does not hold  significant assets other than the class A stock, the value of the class  B stock held by individuals A and B is approximately equal to the value  of a corresponding amount of publicly traded FA stock. The distribution  rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the class B stock,  therefore, are substantially similar in all material respects to the  distribution rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the FA  stock. As a result, the distribution rights provided by the class B  stock are substantially similar in all material respects to the  distribution rights provided by the publicly traded FA stock. Thus, if  treating the class B stock as FA stock would have the effect of treating  FA as a surrogate foreign corporation, under paragraph (i)(1) of this  section the class B stock will be treated as FA stock for purposes of  section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Individuals A and B equally own  DC1. FA, a newly formed corporation, issues stock in a public offering  for cash. Individuals A and B and FA organize FPS. FA transfers part of  the cash from the public offering to FPS in exchange for a class A  partnership interest. FA does not hold any significant assets other than  the class A partnership interest. Individuals A and B transfer their DC1  stock to FPS in exchange for class B partnership interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The class B partnership interests entitle individuals A and B to  cash distributions from FPS approximately equal to any dividend  distributions made by FA with respect to its publicly traded stock. In  certain circumstances, the class B partnership interests also permit  individuals A and B to require FPS to redeem the interests in exchange  for cash equal to the value of an amount of FA stock as determined on  the redemption date. The class B partnership interests do not provide  individuals A or B voting rights with respect to FA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The non-liquidating distribution rights provided by  the class B partnership interests are substantially similar in all   material respects to the dividend rights provided by the FA stock.  Because FA does not hold any significant assets other than the class A  partnership interest, the value of the class B partnership interests  held by individuals A and B is approximately equal to a corresponding  amount of FA stock. The distribution rights on liquidation (or  redemption) provided by the class B partnership interests, therefore,  are substantially similar in all material respects to distribution  rights on liquidation (or redemption) provided by the FA stock. Thus,  the distribution rights provided by the class B partnership interests  are substantially similar in all material respects to the distribution  rights provided by the publicly traded FA stock. As a result, if  treating the class B partnership interests as FA stock would have the  effect of treating FA as a surrogate foreign corporation, under  paragraph (i)(1) of this section the class B partnership interests will  be treated as FA stock for purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.  Individuals A and B equally own DC1. The liabilities of DC1 exceed the  value of its assets. Pursuant to a plan, FA, a newly formed corporation,  acquires substantially all of the properties held by DC1 in exchange  solely for FA stock. Pursuant to the plan, the DC1 stock held by  individuals A and B is cancelled, and the creditors of DC1 receive all  the FA stock in exchange for their claims against DC1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, the FA stock received by the  creditors of DC1 by reason of their claims against DC1 is considered  held by former shareholders of DC1 by reason of holding DC1 stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individuals A and B are United States persons  and equally own DC1. Pursuant to a plan, individuals A and B transfer  their DC1 stock to FA in exchange solely for 80% of the outstanding FA  stock. After the acquisition, the expanded affiliated group that  includes FA does not have substantial business activities in Country A  when compared to the total business activities of the expanded  affiliated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for  purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(i), FA is treated as acquiring all of  the properties held by DC1 on the date of the stock acquisition. After  the acquisition, the former shareholders of DC1 own 80% of the stock of  FA by reason of holding DC1 stock. Therefore, FA is a surrogate foreign  corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section  7874(b). Under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, except for purposes of  determining whether FA is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation,  the conversion of FA to a domestic corporation constitutes a  reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) that occurs at the end  of the day immediately preceding the date of the stock acquisition.  Section 367 applies to the conversion of FA to a domestic corporation.  See, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.367(b)-2 and 1.367(b)-3 for the  consequences of the conversion. Under paragraph (j)(3) of this section,  section 367 does not apply to the transfers of DC1 stock by individuals  A and B to FA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not  reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)  of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the  marketable securities increases the fair market value of the assets of  FA by the fair market value of the marketable securities transferred.  Under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25 shares of FA stock  transferred to PRS are not included in the denominator of the ownership  fraction. Accordingly, the only FA stock included in the ownership  fraction is the FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange for the  DT stock, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator and the  denominator of the ownership fraction.

Then PRS transfers the FT stock to FA, a newly formed  corporation, in exchange solely for 25 shares of FA stock. Finally,  Individual A transfers all the DT stock to FA in exchange solely for 75  shares of FA stock. FA acquires the FT stock with a principal purpose of  avoiding the purposes of section 7874.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(iv) of this section, the FT  stock constitutes nonqualified property because a principal purpose of  FA acquiring the FT stock is to avoid the purposes of section 7874.  Accordingly, the 25 shares of FA stock transferred by FA to PRS in  exchange for the FT stock constitute disqualified stock described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of  this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the  amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the FT stock  increases the fair market value of FA's assets by the fair market value  of the FT stock. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25 shares of  FA stock transferred to PRS are not included in the denominator of the  ownership fraction. Accordingly, the only FA stock included in the  ownership fraction is FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange  for the DT stock, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator  and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership  fraction is 75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. FT, a publicly traded corporation, forms FA, and then FA forms  DMS and FMS. FMS merges with and into FT, with FT surviving the merger  (FMS-FT merger). Pursuant to the FMS-FT merger, the FT shareholders  exchange their FT stock solely for 1,000 shares of FA stock and FT  becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of FA. Following the FMS-FT merger,  DMS merges with and into DT, also a publicly traded corporation, with DT  surviving the merger (DMS-DT merger). Pursuant to the DMS-DT merger, the  DT shareholders exchange their DT stock solely for the remaining 1,000  shares of FA stock, and DT becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of FA.  After the completion of the plan, FA wholly owns FT and DT, DMS and FMS  cease to exist, and the stock of FA is publicly traded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section. Accordingly,  no FA stock is disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section and therefore the FA stock transferred in exchange for the FT  stock and DT stock is included in the denominator of the ownership  fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 1,000/2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)  of this Example 3, except that, instead of undertaking the FMS-FT  merger, FT merges with and into FA with FA surviving the merger (FT-FA  merger). Pursuant to the FT-FA merger, the FT shareholders exchange  their FT stock solely for 1,000 shares of FA stock. At the time of the  FT-FA merger, FT does not hold nonqualified property and has no  obligations. Accordingly, FA stock transferred by FA to FT in exchange  for the property of FT is not disqualified stock described in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section. Furthermore, the 1,000 shares of FA stock  transferred by FT to the shareholders of FT in exchange for their FT  stock do not constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)  of this section. Although the FT stock is nonqualified property (the FT  stock constitutes marketable securities within the meaning of paragraph  (i)(7)(ii) of this section because the stock of FT is publicly traded  and FT is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA  after the acquisition), under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the  transfer of FA stock by FT to the shareholders of FT neither increases  the fair market value of the assets of FA nor decreases the liabilities  of FA. Accordingly, no FA stock is disqualified stock described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section and, therefore, the FA stock  transferred in exchange for the assets of FT and the DT stock is  included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the  ownership fraction is 1,000/2,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns  DT. The fair market value of the DT stock is $100x. PRS transfers $96x  of cash to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange solely for 96  shares of FA stock. Then Individual A transfers the DT stock to FA in  exchange for $96x of cash and 4 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> would be  less than 5% (by vote and value), or 4% (4/100, or 4 shares of FA stock  held by Individual A by reason of owning the DT stock, determined under  Sec. 1.7874-2(f)(2), over 100 shares of FA stock outstanding after the  acquisition). Furthermore, after the acquisition and all transactions  related to the acquisition, Individual A owns less than 5% (by vote and  value) of the stock of FA and DT (the members of the expanded affiliated  group that includes FA). Accordingly, the de minimis exception in  paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies and therefore paragraph (b) of  this section does not apply to exclude the FA stock transferred to PRS  from the denominator of the ownership fraction. Therefore, the FA stock  transferred to Individual A and PRS is included in the denominator of  the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is 4/100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A wholly owns DT. The stock of DT held  by Individual A has a fair market value of $75x. Individual A also holds  an obligation of DT with a value and face amount of $25x. DT holds  property with a value of $100x, and the $25x obligation is associated  with the property. FA, a newly formed corporation, transfers 100 shares  of FA stock to Individual A in exchange for all the DT stock and the  $25x obligation of DT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(iii)(A) of this section, the  $25x obligation of DT constitutes nonqualified property because DT is a  member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA. Thus, the  shares of FA stock transferred by FA to Individual A in exchange for the  obligation of DT constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section. Under Sec. 1.7874-2(f)(2), Individual A is  treated as receiving 75 shares of FA stock in exchange for the DT stock  (100 x $75x/$100x) and 25 shares of FA stock in exchange for the  obligation of DT (100 x $25x/$100x). Thus, 25 shares of FA stock  constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Paragraph  (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock  described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of  FA stock for the $25x obligation increases the fair market value of FA's  assets by $25x. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, the 25  shares of FA stock transferred to Individual A in exchange for the  obligation of DT are not included in the denominator of the ownership  fraction. Accordingly, the only FA stock included in the ownership  fraction is the 75 shares of FA stock transferred to Individual A in  exchange for the DT stock, and that FA stock is included in both the  numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the  ownership fraction is 75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)  of this Example 5, except that instead of acquiring the stock of DT and  the $25x obligation of DT, FA acquires the $100x of property from DT in  exchange solely for 100 shares of FA stock. DT distributes 75 shares of  FA stock to Individual A in exchange for Individual A's DT stock and  transfers 25 shares of FA stock to Individual A in satisfaction of DT's  obligation to Individual A, and liquidates. The 25 shares of FA stock  used to satisfy DT's obligation to Individual A after being transferred  by FA to DT in exchange for the property of DT constitute disqualified  stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of  paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section  does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange  for the property of DT increases the fair market value of FA's assets by  $100x (although the amount of disqualified stock is limited to 25 shares  of FA stock in this case). Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this  section, the 25 shares of FA stock that constitute disqualified stock  are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction.  Accordingly, only 75 shares of FA stock are included in the ownership  fraction, and that FA stock is included in both the numerator and the  denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is  75/75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A  wholly owns DT. Individual B holds all 100 outstanding shares of FA  stock. Individual C acquires 20 shares of FA stock from Individual B for  cash, and then FA acquires all of the stock of DT from Individual A in  exchange solely for 100 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section, cash  constitutes nonqualified property. Accordingly, absent the application  of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the 20 shares of FA stock  transferred by Individual B to Individual C in exchange for cash would  constitute disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Nevertheless,  because Individual B's sale of FA stock neither increases the assets of  FA nor decreases the liabilities of FA, such FA stock is not  disqualified stock by reason of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  Accordingly, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to Individual  B's sale of the 20 shares of FA stock to Individual C, and that FA stock  is included in the denominator of the ownership fraction. The 100 shares  of FA stock received by Individual A are the only shares included in the  numerator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the ownership fraction is  100/200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. P holds 85 shares of DT stock. The remaining 15 shares of DT  stock are held by Individual A. P and Individual A transfer their shares  of DT stock to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 85 and 15  shares of FA stock, respectively, and PRS transfers $75x of cash to FA  in exchange for the remaining 75 shares of FA stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (i)(7)(i) of this section, cash  constitutes nonqualified property. Accordingly, the 75 shares of FA  stock transferred by FA to PRS in exchange for $75x of cash constitute  disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by  reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Furthermore, paragraph  (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the amount of disqualified stock  described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of  FA stock in exchange for $75x of cash increases the fair market value of  the assets of FA by $75x. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this  section, the 75 shares of FA stock transferred to PRS are not included  in the denominator of the ownership fraction. Although PRS's shares of  FA stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction  under paragraph (b) of this section, such shares of FA stock nonetheless  are taken into account for purposes of determining whether P is a member  of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA under paragraph (h) of  this section. Because P holds 48.6% of the FA stock (85/175) after the  acquisition, it is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that  includes FA. In addition, the acquisition does not qualify as an  internal group restructuring described in Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(2) because P  does not hold, directly or indirectly, 80% or more of the shares of FA  stock (by vote and value) after the acquisition. Therefore, the FA stock  held by P (along with the FA stock held by Individual A) is included in  the numerator and the denominator of the ownership fraction. Thus, the  ownership fraction is 100/100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(6)</em>  of this section) to FA in exchange for the remaining 51 shares of FA  stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this  section, the marketable securities constitute nonqualified property.  Accordingly, the shares of FA stock transferred by FA to R in exchange  for the marketable securities constitute disqualified stock described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of  this section. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not reduce the  amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange for the marketable  securities increases the fair market value of the assets of FA by the  fair market value of the marketable securities transferred. Therefore,  under paragraph (b) of this section, the shares of FA stock transferred  to R are not included in the denominator of the ownership fraction.  Although under paragraph (b) of this section R's shares of FA stock are  excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction, under paragraph  (h) of this section such stock is taken into account for purposes of  determining whether P or R is a member of the expanded affiliated group  that includes FA. Because P holds 49% of the shares of FA stock (49/ 100), P is not a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes  FA, and P's FA stock is included in both the numerator and the  denominator of the ownership fraction. Because R holds 51% of the shares  of FA stock (51/100), R is a member of the expanded affiliated group  that includes FA and, before taking into account Sec. 1.7874-1(c), R's  FA stock would be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the  ownership fraction under section 7874(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.7874-1(b).  However, the acquisition results in a loss of control described in Sec.  1.7874-1(c)(2) because P does not hold, in the aggregate, directly or  indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of FA stock (by vote or value)  of R, FA, or DT after the acquisition. Accordingly, the FA stock held by  R would be included in the denominator of the ownership fraction under  Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(1). Nevertheless, the FA stock held by R is excluded  from the denominator of the ownership fraction under paragraphs (b) and  (h) of this section. Thus, the ownership fraction is 49/49.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative facts. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)  of this Example 8, except that, in exchange for 51 shares of FA stock, R  transfers marketable securities (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(6)  of this section) with a value equal to that of 16 shares of FA stock and  qualified property (within the meaning of paragraph (i)(7) of this  section) with a value equal to that of 35 shares of FA stock.  Accordingly, 16 of the 51 shares of FA stock transferred to R constitute  disqualified stock described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by  reason of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and 35 of such shares do  not constitute disqualified stock. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does  not reduce the amount of disqualified stock described in paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section because the transfer of FA stock in exchange  for the marketable securities increases the fair market value of the  assets of FA by the fair market value of the marketable securities  transferred. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, 16 of the  51 shares of FA stock transferred to R are not included in the  denominator of the ownership fraction. Although 16 of the 51 shares of  FA stock that   are transferred to R are excluded from the denominator of the ownership  fraction, under paragraph (h) of this section, all 51 of R's shares of  FA stock are taken into account for purposes of determining whether P or  R is a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA. Because  P holds 49% of the shares of FA stock (49/100), it is not a member of  the expanded affiliated group that includes FA, and its FA stock is  included in both the numerator and the denominator of the ownership  fraction. Because R holds 51% of the shares of FA stock (51/100), it is  a member of the expanded affiliated group that includes FA and, before  taking into account Sec. 1.7874-1(c), its FA stock is excluded from the  numerator and denominator of the ownership fraction under section  7874(c)(2)(A) and Sec. 1.7874-1(b). However, the acquisition results in  a loss of control described in Sec. 1.7874-1(c)(2) because P does not  hold, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the  shares of FA stock (by vote or value) of R, FA, or DT after the  acquisition. Accordingly, the 51 shares of FA stock held by R would be  included in the denominator of the ownership fraction under Sec.  1.7874-1(c)(1). Nevertheless, the 16 shares of FA stock that constitute  disqualified stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership  fraction under paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section. In addition, the  35 shares of FA stock received by R that do not constitute disqualified  stock are included in the denominator. Thus, the ownership fraction is  49/84.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Effective/applicability dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.
