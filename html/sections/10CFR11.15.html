                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application for special nuclear material access  authorization, renewal, or change in level must be filed by the licensee  on behalf of the applicant with the Director, Division of Facilities and  Security, Mail Stop T7-D57, either by mail addressed to the U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001; by hand delivery to  the NRC's offices at 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland; or,  where practicable, by electronic submission, for example, via Electronic  Information Exchange, or CD-ROM. Electronic submissions must be made in  a manner that enables the NRC to receive, read, authenticate,  distribute, and archive the submission, and process and retrieve it a  single page at a time. Detailed guidance on making electronic  submissions can be obtained by visiting the NRC's Web site at http:// www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html; by e-mail to  MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov; or by writing the Office of Information Services,  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. The  guidance discusses, among other topics, the formats the NRC can accept,  the use of electronic signatures, and the treatment of nonpublic  information. Applications for affected individuals employed on October  28, 1985, shall be submitted within 60 days of notification of  Commission approval of the amended security plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensees who wish to secure NRC-U or NRC-R special nuclear  material access authorizations for individuals in possession of an  active NRC Q or L access authorization or other security clearance  granted by another Federal agency based on an equivalent investigation  shall submit a ``Security Acknowledgment'' (NRC Form 176) and a  ``Request for Access Authorization'' (NRC Form 237). NRC will process  these requests by verifying the data on an NRC-cleared individual, or by  contacting the Federal agency that granted the clearance, requesting  certification of the security clearance, and determining the  investigative basis and level of the clearance. Licensees may directly  request the Federal agency that administered the security clearance, if  other than NRC, to certify to the NRC that it has on file an active  security clearance for an individual and to specify the investigative  basis and level of the clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applications for special nuclear material access authorization  for individuals, other than those qualifying under the provisions of  Sec. 11.15(a)(2), must be made on forms supplied by the Commission,  including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86, Parts 1  and 2);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two completed standard fingerprint cards (FD-258);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Security Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other related forms where specified in accompanying instruction  (NRC-254); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement by the employer, prospective employer, or contractor  identifying the job to be assigned to or assumed by the individual and  the level of authorization needed, justified by appropriate reference to  the licensee's security plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, NRC-U  special nuclear material access authorizations must be renewed every  five years from the date of issuance. Except as provided in paragraph  (c)(3) of this section, NRC-R special nuclear material access  authorizations must be renewed every ten years from the date of  issuance. An application for renewal must be submitted at least 120 days  before the expiration of the five-year period for NRC-U and ten-year  period for NRC-R, respectively, and must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement by the licensee that at the time of application for  renewal the individual's assigned or assumed job requires an NRC-U or an  NRC-R special nuclear material access authorization, justified by  appropriate reference to the licensee's security plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86, Parts  1 and 2);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Two completed standard fingerprint cards (FD-258); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other related forms specified in accompanying NRC instructions  (NRC Form 254).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An exception to the time for submission of NRC-U special nuclear  material access authorization renewal applications and the paperwork  required is provided for individuals who have a current and active DOE-Q  access authorization and are subject to DOE Reinvestigation Program  requirements. For these individuals, the submission to DOE of the SF-86  pursuant to DOE Reinvestigation Program requirements (generally every  five years) will satisfy the NRC renewal submission and paperwork  requirements even if less than five years has passed since the date of  issuance or renewal of the NRC-U access authorization. Any NRC-U special  nuclear material access authorization renewed in response to provisions  of this paragraph will not be due for renewal until the date set by DOE  for the next reinvestigation of the individual pursuant to DOE's  Reinvestigation Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An exception to the time for submission of NRC-R special nuclear  material access authorization renewal applications and the paperwork  required is provided for individuals who have a current and active DOE-L  or DOE-Q access authorization and are subject to DOE Reinvestigation  Program requirements. For these individuals, the submission to DOE of  the SF-86 pursuant to DOE Reinvestigation Program requirements will  satisfy the NRC renewal submission and paperwork requirements even if  less than ten years have passed since the date of issuance or renewal of  the NRC-R access authorization. Any NRC-R special nuclear material  access authorization renewed   pursuant to this paragraph will not be due for renewal until the date  set by DOE for the next reinvestigation of the individual pursuant to  DOE's Reinvestigation Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this  section, the period of time for the initial and each subsequent NRC-U  renewal application to NRC may not exceed seven years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this  section, the period of time for the initial and each subsequent NRC-R  renewal application to NRC may not exceed twelve years. Any individual  who is subject to the DOE Reinvestigation Program requirements but, for  administrative or other reasons, does not submit reinvestigation forms  to DOE within seven years of the previous submission, for a NRC-U  renewal or twelve years of the previous submission for a NRC-R renewal,  shall submit a renewal application to NRC using the forms prescribed in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section before the expiration of the seven year  period for NRC-U or twelve year period for NRC-R renewal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If at any time, due to new assignment or assumption of duties, a  change in a special nuclear material access authorization level from NRC  ``R'' to ``U'' is required, the individual shall apply for a change of  level of special nuclear material access authorization. The application  must include a description of the new duties to be assigned or assumed,  justified by appropriate reference to the licensee's security plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) bills the NRC for the  cost of each background investigation conducted in support of an  application for special nuclear material access authorization  (application). The combined cost of the OPM investigation and the NRC's  application processing overhead (NRC processing fee) are recovered  through a material access authorization fee imposed on applicants for  special nuclear material access authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each application for a special nuclear material access  authorization, renewal, or change in level must be accompanied by a  remittance, payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is  equal to the NRC material access authorization fee. This fee must be  determined using the following formula: the OPM investigation billing  rates on the day of NRC receipt of the application + the NRC processing  fee = the NRC material access authorization fee. The NRC processing fee  is determined by multiplying the OPM investigation billing rate on the  day of NRC receipt of the application by 55.8 percent (i.e., OPM rate x  55.8 percent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Updated OPM investigation billing rates are published  periodically in a Federal Investigations Notice (FIN) issued by the  OPM's Federal Investigative Services. Copies of the current OPM  investigation billing rates schedule can be obtained by contacting the  NRC's Personnel Security Branch, Division of Facilities Security, Office  of Administration by email to: Licensee--  Access--Authorization--Fee.Resource@  nrc.gov.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The NRC's Material Access Authorization Program (MAAP) is  considered reimbursable work representing services provided to an  organization for which the NRC is entitled payment. The NRC is  authorized to receive and retain fees from licensees for services  performed. The NRC's Office of the Chief Financial Officer periodically  reviews the fees charged for MAAP and makes recommendations on revising  those charges to reflect costs incurred by the NRC in providing those  services. The reviews are performed using cost analysis techniques to  determine the direct and indirect costs. Based on this review the MAAP  fees are adjusted to reflect the current cost for the program. Copies of  the current NRC material access authorization fee may be obtained by  contacting the NRC's Personnel Security Branch, Division of Facilities  Security, Office of Administration by email to: Licensee--Access--  Authorization--Fee.Resource@nrc.gov. Any change in the NRC's access  authorization fees will be applicable to each access authorization  request received on or after the effective date of the OPM's most  recently published investigation billing rates schedule. Applicants  shall calculate the access authorization fee according to the stated  formula (i.e., OPM rate x 55.8 percent) and with reference to the  following table:     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Plus the NRC's processing fee (rounded to</p><p class="depth3">Is the sum of the current OPM    the nearest dollar), which is equal to</p><p class="depth3">The NRC application fee for an access    investigation billing rate     the OPM investigation billing rate for</p><p class="depth3">authorization of type . . .        charged for an investigation     the type of investigation referenced</p><p class="depth3">of type . . .                     multiplied by . . . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i.

An NRC or DOE-L access authorization or an  equivalent security clearance (``Secret''), based on a background  investigation or national agency check with credit granted or being  processed by another Federal agency before January 1, 1998, is  acceptable to meet this requirement.
