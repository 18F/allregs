(hereinafter referred to as the FLSA), it has the same basic coverage as the FLSA with two principal exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The EPA applies to executive, administrative, and professional employees who are normally exempted from the FLSA for most purposes by section 13(a)(1) of that statute, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The EPA covers all State and local government employees unless they are specifically exempted under section 3(e)(2)(C) of the FLSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The EPA does not apply where the employer has no employees who are engaged in commerce or in the handling of goods that have moved in commerce and the employer is not an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Men are protected under the Act equally with women. While the EPA was motivated by concern for the weaker bargaining position of women, the Act by its express terms applies to both sexes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Most employees of the United States Government, as described in section 3(e)(2) (A) and (B) of the FLSA, are covered by the EPA. Accordingly, these interpretations and principles may generally be applied to Federal sector employment.</p>
