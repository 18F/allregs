As used in this part, ALARA is not a dose limit but a process which has the objective of attaining doses as far below the applicable limits of this part as is reasonably achievable.</p><p class="depth0">Annual limit on intake (ALI) means the derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. ALI is the smaller value of intake of a given radionuclide in a year by the reference man (ICRP Publication 23) that would result in a committed effective dose of 5 rems (0.05 sieverts (Sv)) (1 rem = 0.01 Sv) or a committed equivalent dose of 50 rems (0.5 Sv) to any individual organ or tissue. ALI values for intake by ingestion and inhalation of selected radionuclides are based on International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 68, Dose Coefficients for Intakes of Radionuclides by Workers, published July, 1994 (ISBN 0 08 042651 4). This document is available from Elsevier Science Inc., Tarrytown, NY.</p><p class="depth0">Authorized limit means a limit on the concentration of residual radioactive material on the surfaces or within the property that has been derived consistent with DOE directives including the as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA) process requirements, given the anticipated use of the property and has been authorized by DOE to permit the release of the property from DOE radiological control.</p><p class="depth0">Background means radiation from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Naturally occurring radioactive materials which have not been technologically enhanced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cosmic sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Global fallout as it exists in the environment (such as from the testing of nuclear explosive devices);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Radon and its progeny in concentrations or levels existing in buildings or the environment which have not been elevated as a result of current or prior activities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consumer products containing nominal amounts of radioactive material or producing nominal amounts of radiation.</p><p class="depth0">Bioassay means the determination of kinds, quantities, or concentrations, and, in some cases, locations of radioactive material in the human body, whether by direct measurement or by analysis and evaluation of radioactive materials excreted or removed from the human body.</p><p class="depth0">Calibration means to adjust and/or determine either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The response or reading of an instrument relative to a standard (e.g., primary, secondary, or tertiary) or to a series of conventionally true values; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The strength of a radiation source relative to a standard (e.g., primary, secondary, or tertiary) or conventionally true value.</p><p class="depth0">Contamination area means any area, accessible to individuals, where removable surface contamination levels exceed or are likely to exceed the removable surface contamination values specified in appendix D of this part, but do not exceed 100 times those values.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled area means any area to which access is managed by or for DOE to protect individuals from exposure to radiation and/or radioactive material.</p><p class="depth0">Declared pregnant worker means a woman who has voluntarily declared to her employer, in writing, her pregnancy for the purpose of being subject to the occupational dose limits to the embryo/fetus as provided in Sec. 835.206.

For the radionuclides listed in appendix C of this part, the air immersion DACs were calculated for a continuous, non-shielded exposure via immersion in a semi-infinite cloud of radioactive material. Except as noted in the footnotes to appendix A of this part, the values are based on dose coefficients from International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 68, Dose Coefficients for Intakes of Radionuclides by Workers, published July, 1994 (ISBN 0 08 042651 4) and the associated ICRP computer program, The ICRP Database of Dose Coefficients: Workers and Members of the Public, (ISBN 0 08 043 8768). These materials are available from Elsevier Science Inc., Tarrytown, NY.</p><p class="depth0">Derived air concentration-hour (DAC-hour) means the product of the concentration of radioactive material in air (expressed as a fraction or multiple of the DAC for each radionuclide) and the time of exposure to that radionuclide, in hours.</p><p class="depth0">Deterministic effects means effects due to radiation exposure for which the severity varies with the dose and for which a threshold normally exists (e.g., radiation-induced opacities within the lens of the eye).</p><p class="depth0">DOE means the United States Department of Energy.</p><p class="depth0">DOE activity means an activity taken for or by DOE in a DOE operation or facility that has the potential to result in the occupational exposure of an individual to radiation or radioactive material.

Where wRemainder is the tissue weighting factor assigned to the remainder organs and tissues and HRemainder,50 is the committed equivalent dose to the remainder organs and tissues. Committed effective dose is expressed in units of rem (or Sv).</p><p class="depth0">Committed equivalent dose (HT,50) means the equivalent dose calculated to be received by a tissue or organ over a 50-year period after the intake of a radionuclide into the body.
