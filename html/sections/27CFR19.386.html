                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A proprietor may add trace amounts of acidic or caustic chemical  compounds to adjust or neutralize the pH of denatured spirits. However,  a proprietor may not adjust the pH with any substance that will  counteract or reduce the effect of the denaturants. A proprietor who  adjusts the pH of denatured spirits must keep a record of the adjustment  with reference to the formula number of the treated denatured spirits.  The record must include the kinds and quantities of chemical compounds  used for each batch of denatured spirits treated.  (26 U.S.C. 5241, 5242)</p>
