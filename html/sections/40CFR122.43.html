Sec. 122.41 and 122.42), the Director shall establish conditions, as required on a case-by-case basis, to provide for and assure compliance with all applicable requirements of CWA and regulations. These shall include conditions under Sec. Sec. 122.46 (duration of permits), 122.47(a) (schedules of compliance), 122.48 (monitoring), and for EPA permits only 122.47(b) (alternates schedule of compliance) and 122.49 (considerations under Federal law).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> For a State issued permit, an applicable requirement is a State statutory or regulatory requirement which

takes effect prior to final administrative disposition of a permit. For a permit issued by EPA, an applicable requirement is a statutory or regulatory requirement (including any interim final regulation) which takes effect prior to the issuance of the permit. Section 124.14 (reopening of comment period) provides a means for reopening EPA permit proceedings at the discretion of the Director where new requirements become effective during the permitting process and are of sufficient magnitude to make additional proceedings desirable. For State and EPA administered programs, an applicable requirement is also any requirement which takes effect prior to the modification or revocation and reissuance of a permit, to the extent allowed in Sec. 122.62.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a State issued permit, an applicable requirement is a State statutory or regulatory requirement which
