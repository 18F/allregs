                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator shall provide an opportunity for a public  hearing before a final determination pursuant to Sec.  142.11 that the  State meets or does not meet the requirements for obtaining primary  enforcement responsibility, or a final determination pursuant to Sec.   142.12(d)(3) to approve or disapprove a State request for approval of a  program revision, or a final determination pursuant to Sec.  142.17 that  a State no longer meets the requirements for primary enforcement  responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator shall publish notice of any determination  specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the Federal Register and  in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the State  involved within 15 days after making such determination, with a  statement of his reasons for the determination. Such notice shall inform  interested persons that they may request a public hearing on the  Administrator's determination. Such notice shall also indicate one or  more locations in the State where information submitted by the State  pursuant to Sec.  142.11 is available for inspection by the general  public. A public hearing may be requested by any interested person other  than a Federal agency. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for hearing  may be denied by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for hearing submitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  section shall be submitted to the Administrator within 30 days after  publication of notice of opportunity for hearing in the Federal  Register.

Notice of the hearing shall also  be sent to the person   requesting a hearing, if any, and to the State involved. Notice of the  hearing shall include a statement of the purpose of the hearing,  information regarding the time and location or locations for the hearing  and the address and telephone number of an office at which interested  persons may obtain further information concerning the hearing.

Following the conclusion of the  hearing, the hearing officer shall forward the record of the hearing to  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After reviewing the record of the hearing, the Administrator  shall issue an order affirming the determination referred to in  paragraph (a) of this section or rescinding such determination. If the  determination is affirmed, it shall become effective as of the date of  the Administrator's order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If no timely request for hearing is received and the  Administrator does not determine to hold a hearing on his own motion,  the Administrator's determination shall become effective 30 days after  notice is issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a determination of the Administrator that a State no longer  meets the requirements for primary enforcement responsibility becomes  effective, the State may subsequently apply for a determination that it  meets such requirements by submitting to the Administrator information  demonstrating that it has remedied the deficiencies found by the  Administrator without adversely sacrificing other aspects of its program  required for primary enforcement responsibility.
