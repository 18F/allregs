The County Supervisor  will make a special effort to insure that prospective purchasers, who  traditionally would not be expected to apply for farm ownership loan  assistance because of existing racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice, are  informed of the availability of the Socially Disadvantaged Program.  Emphasis will be placed on providing assistance to such socially  disadvantaged applicants in accordance with the applicable sections of  subpart A of part 1943 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonprogram (NP) borrowers. Nonprogram (NP) borrowers are not  eligible for Homestead Protection provisions as set forth in subpart S  of part 1951 of this chapter. When it is determined that all conditions  of Sec. 1951.558(b) of subpart L of part 1951 of this chapter have been  met, loans for unauthorized assistance will be treated as authorized  loans and will be eligible for homestead protection.
