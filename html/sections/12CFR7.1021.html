                            <p class="depth0">A national bank may participate in a financial literacy program on  the premises of, or at a facility used by, a school. The school premises  or facility will not be considered a branch of the bank if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The bank does not establish and operate the school premises or  facility on which the financial literacy program is conducted; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The principal purpose of the financial literacy program is  educational. For example, a program is educational if it is designed to  teach students the principles of personal economics or the benefits of  saving for the future, and is not designed for the purpose of profit- making.
