                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For turbojet reversing systems--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each system intended for ground operation only must be designed  so that during any reversal in flight the engine will produce no more  than flight idle thrust. In addition, it must be shown by analysis or  test, or both, that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each operable reverser can be restored to the forward thrust  position; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The airplane is capable of continued safe flight and landing  under any possible position of the thrust reverser.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each system intended for inflight use must be designed so that  no unsafe condition will result during normal operation of the system,  or from any failure (or reasonably likely combination   of failures) of the reversing system, under any anticipated condition of  operation of the airplane including ground operation. Failure of  structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this  kind of failure is extremely remote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each system must have means to prevent the engine from producing  more than idle thrust when the reversing system malfunctions, except  that it may produce any greater forward thrust that is shown to allow  directional control to be maintained, with aerodynamic means alone,  under the most critical reversing condition expected in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For propeller reversing systems--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each system intended for ground operation only must be designed  so that no single failure (or reasonably likely combination of failures)  or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse thrust  under any expected operating condition. Failure of structural elements  need not be considered if this kind of failure is extremely remote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with this section may be shown by failure analysis or  testing, or both, for propeller systems that allow propeller blades to  move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is  substantially less than that at the normal flight low-pitch position.  The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made to show  compliance with the requirements of Sec. 35.21 of this chapter for the  propeller and associated installation components.
