                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Any person operating or desiring to operate a treatment facility for garbage that is to be treated

and fed to swine shall apply for a license on a form which will be furnished, upon request, by the Area Veterinarian in Charge or, in States with primary enforcement responsibility, by the State animal health official in the State in which the person operates or intends to operate. When a person operates more than one treatment facility, a separate application to be licensed shall be made for each facility. Exemptions to the requirements of this paragraph may be granted in States other than those with primary enforcement responsibility by the Administrator, if he finds that there would not be a risk to the swine industry in the United States. Any person operating or desiring to operate a facility to treat garbage to be fed to swine who would otherwise be required under this part to obtain a license to treat garbage only because it contains one or more of the items allowed to be fed to swine under Sec. 166.2(a) of this part is exempted from the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acknowledgement of Act and regulations. A copy of the Act and regulations shall be supplied to the applicant at the time the applicant is given a license application. The applicant shall sign a receipt at the time of the prelicensing inspection acknowledging that the applicant has received a copy of the Act and regulations, that the applicant understands them, and agrees to comply with the Act and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstration of compliance with the regulations. (1) Prior to licensing, each applicant shall demonstrate during an inspection of the premises, facilities, and equipment that the facilities and equipment to be used in the treatment of garbage comply with these regulations. If the applicant's facilities and equipment do not meet the standards established by the regulations, the applicant shall not be licensed and shall be advised of the deficiencies and the measures that must be taken to comply with the regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to licensing, each applicant shall demonstrate during an inspection of the premises, facilities, and equipment that the facilities and equipment to be used in the treatment of garbage comply with these regulations. If the applicant's facilities and equipment do not meet the standards established by the regulations, the applicant shall not be licensed and shall be advised of the deficiencies and the measures that must be taken to comply with the regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee shall make the premises, facilities, and equipment available during normal business hours for inspections by an inspector to determine continuing compliance with the Act and regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The facilities and equipment of an applicant for a license shall be in compliance with all applicable governmental environmental regulations before the applicant will be licensed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance of license. A license will be issued to an applicant when the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section have been met, provided that such facility is not located in a State which prohibits the feeding of garbage to swine; and further, that if the Administrator has reason to believe that the applicant for a license is unfit to engage in the activity for which application has been made by reason of the fact that the applicant is engaging in or has, in the past, engaged in any activity in apparent violation of the Act or the regulations which has not been the subject of an administrative proceeding under the Act, an administrative proceeding shall be promptly instituted in which the applicant will be afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the rules of practice under the Act, for the purpose of giving the applicant an opportunity to show cause why the application for license should not be denied. In the event it is determined that the application should be denied, the applicant shall be precluded from reapplying for a license for 1 year from the date of the order denying the application.
