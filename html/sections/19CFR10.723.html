                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Claim. An importer may make a claim for AFTA preferential tariff  treatment, including an exemption from the merchandise processing fee,  based on the importer's knowledge or information in the importer's  possession that the good qualifies as an originating good. The claim is  made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, the  letters ``AU'' as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which  each qualifying good is classified, or by the method specified for  equivalent reporting via an authorized electronic data interchange  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Corrected claim. If, after making the claim required under  paragraph (a) of this section, the importer becomes aware that the claim  is invalid, the importer must promptly and voluntarily correct the claim  and pay any duties that may be due. The importer must submit a statement  either in writing or via an authorized electronic data interchange  system to the CBP office where the original claim was filed specifying  the correction (see Sec. Sec. 10.746 and 10.747 of this subpart).</p>
