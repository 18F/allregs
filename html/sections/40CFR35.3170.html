                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Causes. If the RA determines that the State has not complied  with requirements under title VI, the RA will notify the State of such  noncompliance and prescribe the necessary corrective action. Failure to  satisfy the terms of the capitalization grant agreement, including unmet  conditions or assurances or invalid certifications, is grounds for a  finding of noncompliance. In addition, if the State does not manage the  SRF in a financially sound manner (e.g. allows consistent and  substantial failures of loan repayments), the RA may take corrective  action as provided under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RA's course of action. In making a determination of  noncompliance with the capitalization grant agreement and devising the  corrective action, the RA will identify the nature and cause of the  problems. The State's corrective action must remedy the specific  instance of noncompliance and adjust program management to avoid  noncompliance in the future.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consequences for failure to take corrective action. If within 60  days of receipt of the noncompliance notice, a State fails to take the  necessary actions to obtain the results required by the RA, or to  provide an acceptable plan to achieve the results required, the RA shall  withhold payments to the SRF until the State has taken acceptable  actions. If the State fails to take the necessary corrective action  deemed adequate by the RA within twelve months of receipt of the  original notice, any withheld payments shall be deobligated and  reallotted to other States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Releasing payments. Once the State has taken the corrective  action deemed necessary and adequate by the   RA, the withheld payments will be released and scheduled payments will  recommence.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Subpart K of Part 35--Criteria for evaluating a</p><p class="depth2">State's proposed NEPA-Like process</p><p class="depth2">The following criteria will be used by the RA to evaluate a proposed  SERP.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(A)</em> Legal foundation. Adequate documentation of the legal authority,  including legislation, regulations or executive orders and/or Attorney  General certification that authority exists.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(B)</em> Interdisciplinary approach. The availability of expertise either  in-house or otherwise accessible to the State Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(C)</em> Decision documentation. A description of a documentation process  adequate to explain the basis for decisions to the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(D)</em> Public notice and participation. A description of the process,  including routes of publication (e.g., local newspapers and project  mailing list), and use of established State legal notification systems  for notices of intent, and criteria for determining whether a public  hearing is required. The adequacy of a rationale where the comment  period differs from that under NEPA and is inconsistent with other State  review periods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(E)</em> Consider alternatives. The extent to which the SERP will  adequately consider:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(1)</em> Designation of a study area comparable to the final system;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(2)</em> A range of feasible alternatives, including the no action  alternative;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(3)</em> Direct and indirect impacts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(4)</em> Present and future conditions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(5)</em> Land use and other social parameters including recreation and  open-space considerations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(6)</em> Consistency with population projections used to develop State  implementation plans under the Clean Air Act;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(7)</em> Cumulative impacts including anticipated community growth  (residential, commercial, institutional and industrial) within the  project study area; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(8)</em> Other anticipated public works projects including coordination  with such projects.</p>
