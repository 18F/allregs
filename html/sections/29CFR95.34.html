                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally, sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Activities sponsored by the DOL agency which funded the original project, then</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the DOL agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the grant officer. User charges shall be treated as program income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the written approval of the grant officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired

with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A description of the equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Source of the equipment, including the award number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Unit acquisition cost.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates DOL for its share.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the grant officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original DOL agency. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from DOL. The DOL agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within the DOL agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOL to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. DOL shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOL an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which

is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The DOL agency reserves the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The DOL agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOL fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When DOL exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.</p>
