Electronic formats for submission of reports should be used to the maximum extent practical. Before electronically submitting reports containing scientific and technical information (STI) that is export-controlled or

limited or restricted, contact the Contracting Officer to determine the requirements to electronically transmit these forms of STI. If appropriate electronic safeguards are not available at the time of submission, a paper copy or a CD-ROM of the report shall be required.

Should the Contractor seek to publish or otherwise disseminate the final report, or any additional reports required by 1852.235-74 if applicable, as delivered to NASA under this contract, the Contractor may do so once NASA has completed its document availability authorization review, and availability of the report has been determined.</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I (FEB 2003) As prescribed by 1835.070(d)(1), insert the following as paragraph (e) of the basic clause:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The data resulting from this research activity is ``fundamental research'' which will be broadly shared within the scientific community.
