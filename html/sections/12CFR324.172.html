                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution that is an advanced approaches  FDIC-supervised institution that has completed the parallel run process  and that has received notification from the FDIC pursuant to  Sec. 324.121(d) must publicly disclose each quarter its total and tier 1  risk-based capital ratios and their components as calculated under this  subpart (that is, common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1  capital, tier 2 capital, total qualifying capital, and total risk- weighted assets).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution that is an advanced approaches  FDIC-supervised institution that has completed the parallel run process  and that has received notification from the FDIC pursuant to  sectionSec. 324.121(d) must comply with paragraph (c) of this section  unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company,  savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is  subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S.  banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure  requirements in its home jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution described in paragraph (b) of  this section must provide timely public disclosures each calendar  quarter of the information in the applicable tables in Sec. 324.173. If  a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported   amounts are no longer reflective of the FDIC-supervised institution's  capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this  change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable  thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each  quarter (for example, a general summary of the FDIC-supervised  institution's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system,  and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth  calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes to these are  disclosed in the interim. Management may provide all of the disclosures  required by this subpart in one place on the FDIC-supervised  institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more  than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided  that the FDIC-supervised institution publicly provides a summary table  specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution described in paragraph (b) of  this section must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board  of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures  it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and  disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior  management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective  internal control structure over financial reporting, including the  disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate  review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of  the FDIC-supervised institution must attest that the disclosures meet  the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an FDIC-supervised institution described in paragraph (b) of  this section believes that disclosure of specific commercial or  financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making  public information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature,  the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to disclose those  specific items, but must disclose more general information about the  subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the  reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.
