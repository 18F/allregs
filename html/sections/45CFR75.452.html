keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable. Costs incurred for improvements which add to the permanent value of the buildings and equipment or appreciably prolong their intended life must be treated as capital expenditures (see Sec. 75.439). These costs are only allowable to the extent not paid through rental or other agreements.</p>
