Any word or coined word which is  phonetically similar to the name or designation of a fiber or which is  only a slight variation in spelling from the name or designation of a  fiber shall not be used in such a manner as to represent or imply that  such fiber is present in the product when the fiber is not present as  represented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a word, coined word, symbol, or depiction which connotes  or implies the presence of a fiber is used on any label, whether  required or non-required, a full fiber content disclosure with  percentages shall be made on such label in accordance with the Act and  regulations. Where a word, coined word, symbol, or depiction which  connotes or implies the presence of a fiber is used on any hang-tag  attached to a wool product that has a label providing required  information and the hang-tag provides non-required information, such as  a hang-tag providing information about a particular fiber's  characteristics, the hang-tag need not provide a full fiber content  disclosure; however, if the wool product contains any fiber other than  the fiber identified on the hang-tag, the hang-tag must disclose clearly  and conspicuously that it does not provide the product's full fiber  content; for example:</p><p class="depth2">``This tag does not disclose the product's full fiber content.'' or</p><p class="depth2">``See label for the product's full fiber content.''
