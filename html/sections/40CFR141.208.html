                                Sec.  141.208  Special notice for exceedance of the SMCL for fluoride.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When is the special notice to be given? Community water systems  that exceed the fluoride secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) of 2  mg/l as specified in Sec.  143.3 (determined by the last single sample  taken in accordance with Sec.  141.23), but do not exceed the maximum  contaminant level (MCL) of 4 mg/l for fluoride (as specified in Sec.   141.62), must provide the public notice in paragraph (c) of this section  to persons served. Public notice must be provided as soon as practical  but no later than 12 months from the day the water system learns of the  exceedance. A copy of the notice must also be sent to all new billing  units and new customers at the time service begins and to the State  public health officer. The public water system must repeat the notice at  least annually for as long as the SMCL is exceeded. If the public notice  is posted, the notice must remain in place for as long as the SMCL is  exceeded, but in no case less than seven days (even if the exceedance is  eliminated). On a case-by-case basis, the primacy agency may require an  initial notice sooner than 12 months and repeat notices more frequently  than annually.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What is the form and manner of the special notice? The form and  manner of the public notice (including repeat notices) must follow the  requirements for a Tier 3 public notice in Sec.  141.204(c) and (d)(1)  and (d)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What mandatory language must be contained in the special notice?  The notice must contain the following language, including the language  necessary to fill in the blanks:</p><p class="depth2">This is an alert about your drinking water and a cosmetic dental  problem that might affect children under nine years of age. At low  levels, fluoride can help prevent cavities, but children drinking water  containing more than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of fluoride may  develop cosmetic discoloration of their permanent teeth (dental  fluorosis). The drinking water provided by your community water system  [name] has a fluoride concentration of [insert value] mg/l.</p><p class="depth2">Dental fluorosis, in its moderate or severe forms, may result in a  brown staining and/or pitting of the permanent teeth. This problem  occurs only in developing teeth, before they erupt from the gums.  Children under nine should be provided with alternative sources of  drinking water or water that has been treated to remove the fluoride to  avoid the possibility of staining and pitting of their permanent teeth.  You may also want to contact your dentist about proper use by young  children of fluoride-containing products. Older children and adults may  safely drink the water.</p><p class="depth2">Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride (the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency's drinking water standard) can increase  your risk of developing bone disease. Your drinking water does not  contain more than 4 mg/l of fluoride, but we're required to notify you  when we discover that the fluoride levels in your drinking water exceed  2 mg/l because of this cosmetic dental problem.</p><p class="depth2">For more information, please call [name of water system contact] of  [name of community water system] at [phone number]. Some home water  treatment units are also available to remove fluoride from drinking  water. To learn more about available home water treatment units, you may  call NSF International at 1-877-8-NSF-HELP.''</p>
