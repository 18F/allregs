                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A person must meet the requirements of this section to  be approved to inspect, test, certify, repair, or rebuild a cylinder in  accordance with a DOT specification or a UN pressure receptacle under  subpart C of part 178 or subpart C of part 180 of this chapter, or under  the terms of a special permit issued under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Independent Inspection Agency Review. Each applicant must  arrange for an independent inspection agency, approved by the Associate  Administrator pursuant to this subpart, to perform a review of its  inspection or requalification operation. The person seeking approval  must bear the cost of the inspection. A list of approved independent  inspection agencies is available from the Associate Administrator at the  address listed in Sec. 107.705. Assistance in obtaining an approval is  available from the same address.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application for approval. If the inspection performed by an  independent inspection agency is completed with satisfactory results,  the applicant must submit a letter of recommendation from the  independent inspection agency, an inspection report, and an application  containing the information   prescribed in Sec. 107.705(a). In addition, the application must  contain--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the facility manager;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The types of DOT specification or special permit cylinders, or  UN pressure receptacles that will be inspected, tested, repaired, or  rebuilt at the facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A certification that the facility will operate in compliance  with the applicable requirements of subchapter C of this chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The signature of the person making the certification and the  date on which it was signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance of requalifier identification number (RIN). The  Associate Administrator issues a RIN as evidence of approval to  requalify DOT specification or special permit cylinders, or UN pressure  receptacles if it is determined, based on the applicant's submission and  other available information, that the applicant's qualifications and,  when applicable, facility are adequate to perform the requested  functions in accordance with the criteria prescribed in subpart C of  part 180 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expiration of RIN. Unless otherwise provided in the issuance  letter, an approval expires five years from the date of issuance,  provided the applicant's facility and qualifications are maintained at  or above the level observed at the time of inspection by the independent  inspection agency, or at the date of the certification in the  application for approval for requalifiers only performing inspections  made under Sec. 180.209(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exceptions. Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section, a person who only performs inspections in  accordance with Sec. 180.209(g) of this chapter may submit an  application that, in addition to the information prescribed in  Sec. 107.705(a), identifies the DOT specification/special permit  cylinders to be inspected; certifies the requalifier will operate in  compliance with the applicable requirements of subchapter C of this  chapter; certifies the persons performing inspections have been trained  and have the information contained in each applicable CGA pamphlet  incorporated by reference in Sec. 171.7 of this chapter applicable to  the requalifiers' activities; and includes the signature of the person  making the certification and the date on which it was signed. Each  person must comply with the applicable requirements in this subpart. In  addition, the procedural requirements in subpart H of this part apply to  the filing, processing and termination of an approval issued under this  subpart. No person may requalify a DOT specification/special permit  cylinder in accordance with Sec. 180.209(g) of this chapter unless that  person has been issued a RIN as provided in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each holder of a current RIN shall report in writing any change  in its name, address, ownership, testing equipment, or management or  personnel performing any function under this section, to the Associate  Administrator (PHH-32) within 20 days of the change.
