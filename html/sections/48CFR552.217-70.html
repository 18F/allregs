When option year pricing is  based on a formula (e.g., changes in the Producer Price Index or other  common standard); option year pricing is automatically considered when  evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly  related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore  considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the  Government to exercise the option(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Government will reject the offer if exceptions are taken to  the price provisions of the Economic Price Adjustment clause, unless the  exception results in a lower maximum option year price. Such offers will  be evaluated without regard to the lower option year(s) maximum.  However, if the offeror offering a lower maximum is awarded a contract,  the award will reflect the lower maximum.</p>
