The determination will be made on the basis of the  actual remaining function of the hand or foot, whether the acts of  grasping, manipulation, etc., in the case of the hand, or of balance and  propulsion, etc., in the case of the foot, could be accomplished equally  well by an amputation stump with prosthesis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Extremely unfavorable complete ankylosis of the knee, or  complete ankylosis of 2 major joints of an extremity, or shortening of  the lower extremity of 3\1/2\ inches (8.9 cms.) or more, will be taken  as loss of use of the hand or foot involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Complete paralysis of the external popliteal nerve (common  peroneal) and consequent, footdrop, accompanied by characteristic  organic changes including trophic and circulatory disturbances and other  concomitants confirmatory of complete paralysis of this nerve, will be  taken as loss of use of the foot.
