                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part (40 CFR part 370) establishes reporting requirements  for providing the public with important information on the hazardous  chemicals in their communities. Reporting raises community awareness of  chemical hazards and aids in the development of State and local  emergency response plans. The reporting requirements established under  this part consist of Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) reporting and  inventory reporting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part is written in a special format to make it easier to  understand the regulatory requirements. Like other Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, this part establishes enforceable  legal requirements. Information considered non-binding guidance under  EPCRA is indicated in this regulation by the word ``note'' and a smaller  typeface. Such notes are provided for information purposes only and are  not considered legally binding under this part.</p>
