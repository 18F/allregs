                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Detailed Project Report serves a dual purpose: the report  serves both as basis for approval of a project for construction by the  Chief of Engineers and it serves as a basis for preparation of plans and  specifications. (See exception for emergencies, Sec. 263.17(b)(3)). The  main report should reflect the plan formulation, generally in accordance  with ER 1105-2-402 and ER 1105-2-403. A Design Appendix will be provided  as appropriate, for more detailed information on the development of the  plan, or elements of the selected plan, recommended for implementation  as a Federal project by the Corps of Engineers. The Design Appendix of  the report will generally meet the requirements of ER 1110-2-1150, as it  pertains to Phase II AE&D; studies for projects specifically authorized  by Congress, except that it need not duplicate material on plan  formulation covered in the main report. Other appendixes should be  included as required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is anticipated that DPR's submitted for projects under  Section 208 Authority will be less extensive than reports submitted  under Sections 205, 107, 103 and 111 Authorities, and that DPR's  submitted for projects under Section 14 Authority will be further  abbreviated due to simplicity of the project. The important point is  that the planning process should be generally considered the same for  studies conducted under all Program authorities; the plan formulation  portion of the DPR should reflect this process and the rationale for  arriving at the selected plan and recommendations for Federal  participation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The level of detail and extent of engineering work reflected in  the Design Appendix must be sufficient to proceed directly to plans and  specifications. In the event that the need arrises for feature design  memoranda on selected aspects of the project, such requirements should  be identified in the letter of transmittal accompanying the DPR when  submitted to OCE.</p>
