                                Sec. 655.806  Who may file a complaint and how is it processed?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any aggrieved party, as defined in Sec. 655.715, may file a complaint alleging a violation described in Sec. 655.805(a). The procedures for filing a complaint by an aggrieved party and its processing by the Administrator are set forth in this section. The procedures for filing and processing information alleging violations from persons or organizations that are not aggrieved parties are set forth in Sec. 655.807. With regard to complaints filed by any aggrieved person or organization--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No particular form of complaint is required, except that the complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be reduced to writing by the Wage and Hour Division official who receives the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The complaint shall set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation as described in Sec. 655.805 has been committed, and therefore that an investigation is warranted. This determination shall be made within 10 days of the date that the complaint is received by a Wage and Hour Division official. If the Administrator determines that the complaint fails to present reasonable cause for an investigation, the Administrator shall so notify the complainant, who may submit a new complaint, with such additional information as may be necessary. No hearing or appeal pursuant to this subpart shall be available where the Administrator determines that an investigation on a complaint is not warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Administrator determines that an investigation on a complaint is warranted, the complaint shall be accepted for filing; an investigation shall be conducted and a determination issued within 30 calendar days of the date of filing. The time for the investigation may be increased with the consent of the employer and the complainant, or if, for reasons outside of the control of the Administrator, the Administrator needs additional time to obtain information needed from the employer or other sources to determine whether a violation has occurred. No hearing or appeal pursuant to this subpart shall be available regarding the Administrator's determination that an investigation on a complaint is warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event that the Administrator seeks a prevailing wage determination from ETA pursuant to Sec. 655.731(d), or advice as to prevailing working conditions from ETA pursuant to Sec. 655.732(c)(2), the 30-day investigation period shall be suspended from the date of the Administrator's request to the date of the Administrator's receipt of the wage determination (or, in the event that the employer challenges the wage determination through the Employment Service complaint system, to the date of the completion of such complaint process).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A complaint must be filed not later than 12 months after the latest date on which the alleged violation(s) were committed, which would be the date on which the employer allegedly failed to perform an action or fulfill a condition specified in the LCA, or the date on which the employer, through its action or inaction, allegedly demonstrated a misrepresentation of a material fact in the LCA. This jurisdictional bar does not affect the scope of the remedies which may be assessed by the Administrator. Where, for example, a complaint is timely filed, back wages may be assessed for a period prior to one year before the filing of a complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A complaint may be submitted to any local Wage and Hour Division office. The addresses of such offices are found in local telephone directories,

and on the Department's informational site on the Internet at http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/contacts/whd/america2.htm. The office or person receiving such a complaint shall refer it to the office of the Wage and Hour Division administering the area in which the reported violation is alleged to have occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an investigation has been conducted, the Administrator shall, pursuant to Sec. 655.815, issue a written determination as described in Sec. 655.805(a).
