                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For any home loan secured by borrower-occupied property, or property to be occupied by the borrower, adjustments to the interest rate, payment, balance, or term to maturity must comply with the limitations of this section and the disclosure and notice requirements of 560.210 until superseding regulations are issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjustments to the interest rate shall correspond directly to the movement of an index satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. A Federal savings association also may increase the interest rate pursuant to a formula or schedule that specifies the amount of the increase, the time at which it may be made, and which is set forth in the loan contract. A Federal savings association may decrease the interest rate at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments to the payment and the loan balance that do not reflect an interest-rate adjustment may be made if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The adjustments reflect a change in an index that may be used pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a payment adjustment, the adjustment reflects a change in the loan balance or is made pursuant to a formula, or to a schedule specifying the percentage or dollar change in the payment as set forth in the loan contract; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an open-end line-of-credit loan, the adjustment reflects an advance taken by the borrower under the line-of-credit and is permitted by the loan contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Any index used must be readily available and independently verifiable. If set forth in the loan contract, an association may use any combination of indices, a moving average of index values, or more than one index during the term of a loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any index used must be readily available and independently verifiable. If set forth in the loan contract, an association may use any combination of indices, a moving average of index values, or more than one index during the term of a loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, any index used must be a national or regional index.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Federal savings association may use an index not satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section 30 days after filing a notice unless, within that 30-day period, the OCC has notified the association that the notice presents supervisory concerns or raises significant issues of law or policy. If the OCC notifies the association of such concerns or issues, the Federal savings association may not use such an index unless it applies for and receives the OCC's prior written approval under the standard treatment processing procedures at part 116, subparts A and E of this chapter.</p>
