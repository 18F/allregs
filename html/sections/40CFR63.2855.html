                                Sec. 63.2855  How do I determine the quantity of oilseed processed?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">All oilseed measurements must be determined on an as received basis,  as defined in Sec. 63.2872. The as received basis refers to the oilseed  chemical and physical characteristics as initially received by the  source and prior to any oilseed handling and processing. By the end of  each calendar month following an operating month, you must determine the  tons as received of each listed oilseed processed for the operating  month. The total oilseed processed for an operating month includes the  total of each oilseed processed during all normal operating periods that  occur within the operating month. If you have determined the tons of  oilseed processed for 12 or more operating months, then you must also  determine the 12 operating months rolling sum of each type oilseed  processed by summing the tons of each type of oilseed processed for the  previous 12 operating months. The 12 operating months rolling sum of  each type of oilseed processed is used to calculate the compliance ratio  as described in Sec. 63.2840.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>  through (5) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The dates that define each operating status period. The dates  that define each operating status period include the beginning date of  each calendar month and the date of any change in the source operating  status. If, prior to the effective date of this rule, your source  determines the oilseed inventory on an accounting month rather than a  calendar month basis, and you have 12 complete accounting months of  approximately equal duration in a calendar year, you may substitute the  accounting month time interval for the calendar month time interval. If  you choose to use an accounting month rather than a calendar month, you  must document this measurement frequency selection in your plan for  demonstrating compliance, and you must remain on this schedule unless  you request and receive written approval from the agency responsible for  these   NESHAP. The dates on each oilseed inventory log must be consistent with  the dates recorded for the solvent inventory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Tons of each oilseed received. Record the type of oilseed and  tons of each shipment of oilseed received and added to your on-site  storage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em>  through (v) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Oilseed that mold or otherwise become unsuitable for processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Oilseed you sell before it enters the processing operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Oilseed destroyed by an event such as a process malfunction,  fire, or natural disaster.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Oilseed processed through operations prior to solvent  extraction such as screening, dehulling, cracking, drying, and  conditioning; but that are not routed to the solvent extractor for  further processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Periodic physical measurements of inventory. For example, some  sources periodically empty oilseed storage silos to physically measure  the current oilseed inventory. This periodic measurement procedure  typically results in a small inventory correction. The correction  factor, usually less than 1 percent, may be used to make an adjustment  to the source's oilseed inventory that was estimated previously with  indirect measurement techniques. To make this adjustment, your plan for  demonstrating compliance must provide for such an adjustment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use Equation 1 of this section to determine the quantity of each  oilseed type processed at your affected source during normal operating  periods recorded within a calendar month. Equation 1 of this section  follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12AP01.000  Where:  SEEDB = Tons of oilseed in the inventory at the beginning of</p><p class="depth2">normal operating period ``i'' as determined in accordance with</p><p class="depth2">paragraph (a)(3) of this section. SEEDE = Tons of oilseed in the inventory at the end of normal</p><p class="depth2">operating period ``i'' as determined in accordance with</p><p class="depth2">paragraph (a)(3) of this section. SEEDR = Tons of oilseed received during normal operating</p><p class="depth2">period ``i'' as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)</p><p class="depth2">of this section.
