                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Improper surety bond guarantee practices--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Imprudent  practices. SBA may refuse to issue further guarantees to a Prior  Approval Surety or may suspend the preferred status of a PSB Surety, by  written notice stating all reasons for such decision and the effective  date. Reasons for such a decision include, but are not limited to, a  determination that the Surety (in its underwriting, its efforts to  minimize Loss, its claims or recovery practices, or its documentation  related to SBA guaranteed bonds) has failed to adhere to prudent  standards or practices, including any standards or practices required by  SBA, as compared to those of other Sureties participating in the same  SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regulatory violations, fraud. Acts of wrongdoing such as fraud,  material misrepresentation, breach of the Prior Approval or PSB  Agreement, or regulatory violations (as defined in Secs. 115.19(d) and  115.19(h)) also constitute sufficient grounds for refusal to issue  further guarantees, or in the case of a PSB Surety, termination of  preferred status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Audit; records. The failure of a Surety to consent to SBA's  audit or to maintain and produce records constitutes grounds for SBA to  refuse to   issue further guarantees for a Prior Approval Surety, to suspend a PSB  Surety from participation, and to refuse to honor claims submitted by a  Prior Approval or PSB Surety until the Surety consents to the audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Excessive Losses. If a Surety experiences excessive Losses on  SBA guaranteed bonds relative to those of other Sureties participating  in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree,  SBA may also require the renegotiation of the guarantee percentage and/ or SBA's charge to the Surety for bonds executed thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (1) through (5) of  this section involving any of the following Persons: The Surety or any  of its officers, directors, partners, or other individuals holding at  least 20% of the Surety's voting securities, and any agents,  underwriters, or any individual empowered to act on behalf of any of the  preceding Persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a State or other authority has revoked, canceled, or  suspended the license required of such Person to engage in the surety  business, the right of such Person to participate in the SBA Surety Bond  Guarantee Program may be denied, terminated, or suspended, as  applicable, in that jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions.  Ineligibility or suspension from the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs is  for at least the duration of the license suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If such Person has been indicted or otherwise formally charged  with a misdemeanor or felony bearing on such Person's fitness to  participate in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs, the participation of  such Person may be suspended pending disposition of the charge. Upon  conviction, participation may be denied or terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a final civil judgment is entered holding that such Person  has committed a breach of trust or violation of a law or regulation  protecting the integrity of business transactions or relationships,  participation may be denied or terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If such Person has made a material misrepresentation or  willfully false statement in the presentation of oral or written  information to SBA in connection with an application for a surety bond  guarantee or the presentation of a claim, or committed a material breach  of the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement or a material violation of the  regulations (all as described in Sec. 115.19), participation may be  denied or terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If such Person is debarred, suspended, voluntarily excluded  from, or declared ineligible for participation in Federal programs,  participation may be denied or terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification requirement. The Prior Approval or PSB Surety must  promptly notify SBA of the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1)  through (5) of this section, or if any of the Persons described in  paragraph (b) of this section does not, or ceases to, qualify as a  Surety. SBA may require submission of a Statement of Personal History  (SBA Form 912) from any of these Persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> SBA proceedings. Decisions to suspend, terminate, deny  participation in, or deny reinstatement in the Surety Bond Guarantee  program are made by the D/SG. A Surety may file a petition for review of  suspensions and terminations with the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals  (OHA) under part 134 of this chapter. SBA's Administrator may, pending a  decision pursuant to part 134 of this chapter, suspend the participation  of any Surety for any of the causes listed in paragraphs (b) (1) through  (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect on guarantee. A guarantee issued by SBA before a  suspension or termination under this section remains in effect, subject  to SBA's right to deny liability under the guarantee.</p>
