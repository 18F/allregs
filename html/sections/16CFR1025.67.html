Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the post-employee restrictions applicable to former Commission members and employees, as set forth in the Commission's ``Post Employment Restrictions Applicable to Former Commission Officers and Employees'', 16 CFR part 1030, subpart L, shall govern the activities of former Commission members and employees in matters connected with their former duties and responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participation as witness. A former member or employee of the Commission may testify in any proceeding subject to these Rules concerning his/her participation in any Commission activity. This section does not constitute a waiver by the Commission of any objection provided by law to testimony that would disclose privileged or confidential material. The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1905 prohibiting the disclosure of trade secrets also applies to testimony by former members and employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for requesting authorization to appear. In cases to which paragraph (a) of this section is applicable, a former member or employee of the Commission may request authorization to appear or participate in any proceedings or investigation by filing with the Secretary a written application disclosing the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature and extent of the former member's or employee's participation in, knowledge of, and connection with the proceedings or investigation during his/her service with the Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the files of the proceedings or investigation came to his/her attention;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether he/she was employed in the directorate, division, or other organizational unit within the Commission in which the proceedings or investigation is or has been pending;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether he/she worked directly or in close association with Commission personnel assigned to the proceedings or investigation and, if so, with whom and in what capacity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether during service with the Commission, he/she was engaged in any matter concerning the person involved in the proceedings or investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Denial of request to appear. The requested authorization shall not be given in any case:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where it appears that the former member or employee, during service with the Commission, participated personally and substantially in the proceedings or investigation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the Commission is not satisfied that the appearance or participation will not involve any actual or apparent impropriety; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any case which would result in a violation of title 18, United States Code, section 207.</p>
