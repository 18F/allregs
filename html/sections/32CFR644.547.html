                            <p class="depth0">Granting an extension of time, where unusual or unforeseeable circumstances are not present, is contrary to the form of the Invitation for Bids, and amounts to the application of special conditions not provided for therein. This violates GSA regulations and the principles of fair competition. Adoption of the following guides in the development and administration of sales programs will help to avoid unjustified requests for extensions of time:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of realistic periods for completion of the sales contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Necessary and justified extensions to be authorized subject to posting additional bond to insure performance and payment of adequate consideration where use of Government land is involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable restrictions on resale of improvements at the site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prohibition against posting advertising signs and storage of salvaged material on the installation pending sale to other customers.</p>
