                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A statement of net worth shall be filed with the  application for an award of fees. The statement shall reflect the net  worth of the applicant and all affiliates of the applicant, as specified  in Sec. 263.103(c)(5). In all cases, the administrative law judge or  the Board may call for additional information needed to establish the  applicant's net worth as of the initiation of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided herein, the statement  of net worth may be in any form convenient to the applicant which fully  discloses all the assets and liabilities of the applicant and all the  assets and liabilities of its affiliates, as of the time of the  initiation of the adversary adjudication. Unaudited financial statements  are acceptable for individual applicants as long as the statement  provides a reliable basis for evaluation, unless the administrative law  judge or the Board otherwise requires. Financial statements or reports  filed with or reported to a Federal or State agency, prepared before the  initiation of the adversary proceeding for other purposes, and accurate  as of a date not more than three months prior to the initiation of the  proceeding, shall be acceptable in establishing net worth as of the time  of the initiation of the proceeding, unless the administrative law judge  or the Board otherwise requires.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of applicants or affiliates that are not banks, net  worth shall be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the  excess of total assets over total liabilities, as of the date the  underlying proceeding was initiated, except as adjusted under   Sec. 263.103(c)(5). The net worth of a bank holding company or a  savings and loan holding company shall be considered on a consolidated  basis. Assets and liabilities of individuals shall include those  beneficially owned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the applicant or any of its affiliates is a bank or a savings  association, the portion of the statement of net worth which relates to  the bank or the savings association shall consist of a copy of the  bank's or a savings association's last Consolidated Report of Condition  and Income filed before the initiation of the adversary adjudication.  Net worth shall be considered for the purposes of this subpart to be the  total equity capital (or, in the case of mutual savings banks or mutual  savings associations, the total surplus accounts) as reported, in  conformity with applicable instructions and guidelines, on the bank's or  the savings association's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income  filed for the last reporting date before the initiation of the  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement confidential. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board or  required by law, the statement of net worth shall be for the  confidential use of the Board, counsel for the Board, and the  administrative law judge.
