                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic rule: Time limit for rendering Administrator decisions, Board decisions, and action subject to immediate review. The Administrator, at his or her discretion, may immediately review any decision of the Board specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Nonfinal decisions or actions by the Board are not immediately reviewable, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The Administrator may exercise this discretionary review authority on his or her own motion, or in response to a request from: a party to the Board appeal; CMS; or, in the case of a matter specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section, another affected nonparty to a Board appeal. All requests for Administrator review and any other submissions to the Administrator under paragraph (c) of this section must be sent to the Office of the Attorney Advisor. The Office of the Attorney Advisor must examine each Board decision specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and each matter described in Sec. 405.1845(h)(3), Sec. 405.1853(e)(6)(ii), or Sec. 405.1857(d)(2) of this subpart, of which it becomes aware, together with any review requests or any other submission made in accordance with the provisions of this section, in order to assist the Administrator's exercise of this discretionary review authority. The Board is required to send to the Office of the Attorney Advisor a copy of each decision specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section upon issuance of the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date of rendering any decision after the review by the Administrator must be no later than 60 days after the date of receipt by the provider of a reviewable Board decision or action. For purposes of this section, the date of rendering is the date the Administrator signs the decision, and not the date the decision is mailed or otherwise transmitted to the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may immediately review:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Board hearing decision (as described in Sec. 405.1871 of this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Board dismissal decision (as described in Sec. Sec. 405.1836(e)(1) and (e)(2), 405.1840(c)(2) and (c)(3), 405.1868(d)(1) and (d)(2) of this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A Board EJR decision, but only the question of whether there is Board jurisdiction over a specific matter at issue in the decision; the Administrator may not review the Board's determination in a decision of its authority to decide a legal question relevant to the matter at issue (as described in Sec. 405.1842(h) of this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any other Board decision or action deemed to be final by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any decision or action by the Board not specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section, or not deemed to be final by the Administrator under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, is nonfinal and not subject to Administrator review until the Board issues one of the decisions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except the Administrator may review immediately the following matters:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Board ruling authorizing discovery or disclosure of a matter for which an objection was made based on privilege or other protection from disclosure such as case preparation, confidentiality, or undue burden (as described in Sec. 405.1853(e)(6)(ii) of this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Board subpoena compelling disclosure of a matter for which an objection was made based on privilege or other protection from disclosure such as case preparation, confidentiality, or undue burden (as described in Sec. 405.1857(d)(2) of this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Illustrative list of criteria for deciding whether to review. In deciding whether to review a Board decision or other matter specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, either on his or her own motion or in response to a request for review, the Administrator considers criteria such as whether it appears that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Board made an erroneous interpretation of law, regulation, CMS Ruling, or other interpretive rules,

general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice established by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Board hearing decision meets the requirements of Sec. 405.1871(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Board erred in refusing to admit certain evidence or in not considering other submitted matter (as described in Sec. Sec. 405.1855 and 405.1865(b) of this subpart), or in admitting certain evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The case presents a significant policy issue having a basis in law and regulations, and review is likely to lead to the issuance of a CMS Ruling or other directive needed to clarify a statutory or regulatory provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Board has incorrectly found, assumed, or denied jurisdiction over a specific matter at issue or extended its authority in a manner not provided for by statute, regulation, CMS Ruling, or other interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice established by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The decision or other action of the Board requires clarification, amplification, or an alternative legal basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A remand to the Board may be necessary or appropriate under the criteria prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedures--(1) Review requests.

The request must state the reason(s) why the ruling was in error and the potential harm that may be caused if immediate review is not granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notice of review. (i) When the Administrator decides to review a Board decision or other matter specified in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, respectively, whether on his or her own motion or upon request, the Administrator must send a written notice to the parties, CMS, and any other affected nonparty stating that the Board's decision is under review, and indicating the specific issues that are being considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Administrator may decline to review a Board decision or other matter, or any issue in a decision or matter, even if a request for review is submitted in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Written submissions on review. If the Administrator accepts review of the Board's decision or other reviewable action, a party, CMS, or, another affected nonparty that requested review solely of a matter described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a) (3)(ii) of this section, may tender written submissions regarding the review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date of receipt by the Office of the Attorney Advisor of any material must be no later than 15 days after the date the party, CMS or other affected nonparty submitting comments received the Administrator's notice under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, taking review of the Board decision or other reviewable matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any submission must be limited to the issues accepted for Administrator review (as identified in the notice) and be confined to the record of Board proceedings (as described in Sec. 405.1865 of this subpart). The submission may include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Argument and analysis supporting or taking exception to the Board's decision or other reviewable action;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Supporting reasons, including legal citations and excerpts of record evidence, for any argument and analysis submitted under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Rebuttal to any written submission filed previously with the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> A request, with supporting reasons, that the decision or other reviewable action be remanded to the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Ex parte communications prohibited. The Administrator does not consider any communication that does not meet the following requirements or is not submitted within the required time limits.

paragraph (f) of this section is not a final decision for purposes of judicial review (as described in Sec. 405.1877(a)(4) of this subpart) or the provisions of Sec. 405.1803(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Remand. (1) A remand to the Board by the Administrator has the effect for purposes of review--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to a Board decision specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, vacating the Board's decision and requiring further proceedings in accordance with the Administrator's decision and this subpart; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to a matter described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, affirming, reversing, modifying, or remanding the Board's remand order, discovery ruling, or subpoena, as applicable, and returning the case to the Board for further proceedings in accordance with the Administrator's decision and this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may direct the Board to take further action for the development of additional facts or new issues, or to consider the applicability of laws or regulations other than those considered by the Board.

When the contractor's denial of the relief, that the provider sought before the Board and that is under review by the Administrator, was based on procedural grounds (such as the alleged failure of the provider to satisfy a time limit) or was based on the alleged failure to supply adequate documentation to support the provider's claim, and the Administrator rules that the basis of the contractor's denial is invalid, the Administrator remands to the contractor for the contractor to make a determination on the merits of the provider's claim.
