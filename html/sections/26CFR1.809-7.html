                                Sec. 1.809-7  Limitation on certain deductions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 809(f)(1) limits the deductions under  section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6), relating to deductions for dividends  to policyholders, certain nonparticipating contracts, and group life,  accident, and health insurance contracts, respectively. This limitation  provides that the amount of such deductions shall not exceed the sum of  (1) the amount (if any) by which the gain from operations for the  taxable year (determined without regard to such deductions) exceeds the  taxpayer's taxable investment income for such year, plus (2) $250,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of limitation. Section 809(f)(2) provides a priority  system for applying the limitation contained in section 809(f)(1) and  paragraph (a) of this section. Under this priortity system, the  limitation shall be applied in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(6)  (relating to group life, accident, and health insurance);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Then to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(5)  (relating to certain nonparticipating contracts); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Finally to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(3)  (relating to dividends to policyholders).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the  limitation shall be applied in the following order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Then to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(6);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Finally to the amount of the deduction under section  809(d)(5).  Thus, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the  limitation and priority system would operate first to disallow a  deduction under section 809(d)(5), then a deduction under section  809(d)(6), and finally a deduction under section 809(d)(3). For purposes  of applying the 50 percent limitation contained in section 809(d)(6)  with respect to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1961, the  amount of the deductions for taxable years beginning before January 1,  1962, shall be determined by applying the priortity system contained in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Illustration of principles. The operation of the limitation and  priority system provided by section 809(f) and this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Assume the following facts with respect to M, a life  insurance company, for the taxable year 1958:  Gain from operations computed without regard to the         $100,000,000</p><p class="depth0">deductions under sec. 809(d) (3), (5), and (6)......... Taxable investment income...............................      83,000,000 Tentative deduction for group life, accident, and health       4,000,000</p><p class="depth0">insurance under sec. 809(d)(6)......................... Tentative deduction for certain nonparticipating               6,000,000</p><p class="depth0">contracts under sec. 809(d)(5)......................... Tentative deduction for dividends to policyholders under      10,000,000</p><p class="depth0">sec. 809(d)(3).........................................</p><p class="depth0">In order to determine the limitation on the deductions under section  809(d) (3), (5), and (6), M would make up the following schedule:  (1) Statutory amount provided under sec. 809(f)(1)........      $250,000 (2) Gain from operations computed without     $100,000,000</p><p class="depth0">regard to the deductions under sec.</p><p class="depth0">809(d) (3), (5), and (6)................. (3) Taxable investment income.............      83,000,000</p><p class="depth0">---------------- (4) Excess of item (2) over item (3)......................    17,000,000</p><p class="depth0">----------------- (5) Limitation on deductions under sec. 809(d) (3), (5),     17,250,000</p><p class="depth0">and (6) (item (1) plus item (4))......................... Since the total tentative deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> ($20,000,000) exceeds the limitation on such deductions</p><p class="depth0"><em>($17,250,000)</em>, M would make up the following schedule to determine the</p><p class="depth0">application of the priority system:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Maximum possible deduction under sec. 809(d) (3), (5),   $17,250,000</p><p class="depth0">and (6) (item (5)).......................................

The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the  taxable year is 1962. Since the total tentative deductions under section  809(d) (3), (5), and (6) ($20,000,000) exceeds the limitation on such  deductions ($17,250,000), M would make up the following schedule to  determine the application of the priority system:  (1) Maximum possible deductions under sec. 809(d) (3),       $17,250,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> in example 1).....................
