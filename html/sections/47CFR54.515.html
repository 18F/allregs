                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A telecommunications carrier providing services eligible for support under this subpart to eligible schools and libraries may, at the election of the carrier, treat the amount eligible for support under this subpart as an offset against the carrier's universal service contribution obligation for the year in which the costs for providing eligible services were incurred or receive a direct reimbursement from the Administrator for that amount. Carriers shall elect in January of each year the method by which they will be reimbursed and shall remain subject to that method for the duration of the calendar year. Any support amount that is owed a carrier that fails to remit its monthly universal service contribution obligation, however, shall first be applied as an offset to that carrier's contribution obligation. Such a carrier shall remain subject to the offsetting method for the remainder of the calendar year in which it failed to remit their monthly universal service obligation. A carrier that continues to be in arrears on its universal service contribution obligations at the end of a calendar year shall remain subject to the offsetting method for the next calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a telecommunications carrier elects to treat the amount eligible for support under this subpart as an offset against the carrier's universal service contribution obligation and the total amount of support owed to the carrier exceeds its universal service obligation, calculated on an annual basis, the carrier shall receive a direct reimbursement in the amount of the difference. Any such reimbursement due a carrier shall be submitted to that carrier no later than the end of the first quarter of the calendar year following the year in which the costs were incurred and the offset against the carrier's universal service obligation was applied.
