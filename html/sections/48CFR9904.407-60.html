                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contractor A's written practice is to set his material-price  standard for an item on the basis of average purchase prices expected to  prevail during the calendar year. For that item whose usage from month  to month is stable, a purchase contract is generally signed on May 1 of  each year for a 1-year commitment. The current purchase contract calls  for a purchase price of $3 per pound; an increase of 5 percent, or  15[cent] per pound, has been announced by the vendor when the new  purchase contract comes into effect next May. Contractor A sets his  material-price standard for this item at $3.10 per pound for the year  ([$3.00x4+$3.15x8]/12). Since Contractor A sets his material-price  standard in accordance with his written practice, he complies with  provisions of 9904.407-40(c) of this Cost Accounting Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contractor B accumulates, in one account, labor cost at standard  for a department in which several categories of direct labor of  disparate functions, in different combinations, are used in the  manufacture of various dissimilar outputs of the department. Contractor  B's department is not a production unit as defined in 9904.407-30(a)(7)  of this Cost Accounting Standard. Modifying his practice so as to comply  with the definition of production unit in 9904.407-30(a)(7), he could  accumulate the standard costs and variances separately,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each of the several categories of direct labor, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each of several subdepartments, with homogeneous output for  each of the subdepartments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contractor C allocates variances at the end of each month.  During the month of March, a production unit has accumulated the  following data with respect to labor:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Labor</p><p class="depth2">Labor     dollars     Labor</p><p class="depth2">hours at      at        cost</p><p class="depth2">standard   standard   variance ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Balance, March 1.......................      5,000    $25,000     $2,000 Additions in March.....................     15,000     75,000      5,000</p><p class="depth2">--------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Total..............................     20,000    100,000      7,000 Transfers-out in March.................      8,000     40,000</p><p class="depth2">-------------------------------- Balance, March 31......................     12,000     60,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Using labor hours at standard as the base, Contractor C establishes a  labor-cost variance rate of $.35 per standard labor hour ($7,000 /  20,000), and deducts $2,800 ($.35x8,000) from the labor-cost variance  account, leaving a balance of $4,200 ($7,000-$2,800). Contractor C's  practice complies with provisions of 9904.407-50(d)(1) of this Cost  Accounting Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contractor D, who uses materials the prices of which are  expected to fluctuate at different rates, recognizes material-price  variances at the time purchases of material are entered into the books  of account. He maintains one purchase-price variance account for the  whole plant. Purchased items are   requisitioned by various production units in the plant. Since prices of  material are expected to fluctuate at different rates, this plant-wide  grouping does not constitute a homogeneous grouping of material.  Contractor D's practice does not comply with provisions of 9904.407- 50(b)(2) of this Cost Accounting Standard. However, if he would maintain  several purchased-items inventory accounts, each representing a  homogeneous grouping of material, and maintain a material-price variance  account for each of these homogeneous groupings of material, Contractor  D's practice would comply with 9904.407-50(b)(2) of this Cost Accounting  Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contractor E recognizes material-price variances at the time  purchases of material are entered into the books of account and  allocates variances at the end of each month.
