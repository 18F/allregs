                            <p class="depth0">The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the  full faith and credit of the United States and is not contestable except  for fraud or misrepresentation (including negligent misrepresentation)  of which the lender or holder has actual knowledge, participates in, or  condones. A note which provides for the payment of interest on interest  shall not be guaranteed and any Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment  Guarantee Agreement attached to, or relating to, a note which provides  for payment of interest on interest is void. The Loan Note Guarantee  will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is  occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure  to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which the  Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses occasioned will  not be enforceable by the lender to the extent that loan funds are used  for purposes other than those specifically approved by the Agency in its  Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as  the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent lender  would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not  guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act,  but also not acting in a timely manner, acting in a manner contrary to  the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time  of loan maturity, or until a final loss is paid. The Loan Note Guarantee  or Assignment Guarantee Agreement in the hands of a holder shall not  cover interest accruing 90 days after the holder has demanded repurchase  by the lender, nor shall the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee  Agreement in the hands of a   holder cover interest accruing 90 days after the lender or Agency has  requested the holder to surrender the evidence of debt for repurchase.</p>
