                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Systems shall complete the applicable source water monitoring and  treatment requirements (described in the referenced portions of  paragraph (b) of this section, and in Sec. Sec.  141.86, and 141.88) by  the following deadlines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Deadlines for completing source water treatment steps--(1) Step  1: A system exceeding the lead or copper action level shall complete  lead and copper source water monitoring (Sec.  141.88(b)) and make a  treatment recommendation to the State (Sec.  141.83(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em> no later than  180 days after the end of the monitoring period during which the lead or  copper action level was exceeded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2))</em> within 6 months after submission of  monitoring results under step 1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3))</em>  within 24 months after completion of step 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Step 4: The system shall complete follow-up tap water monitoring  (Sec.  141.86(d)(2) and source water monitoring (Sec.  141.88(c)) within  36 months after completion of step 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Step 5: The State shall review the system's installation and  operation of source water treatment and specify maximum permissible  source water levels (Sec.  141.83(b)(4)) within 6 months after  completion of step 4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Step 6: The system shall operate in compliance with the State- specified maximum permissible lead and copper source water levels (Sec.   141.83(b)(4)) and continue source water monitoring (Sec.  141.88(d)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of source water treatment requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> System  treatment recommendation. Any system which exceeds the lead or copper  action level   shall recommend in writing to the State the installation and operation  of one of the source water treatments listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section. A system may recommend that no treatment be installed based  upon a demonstration that source water treatment is not necessary to  minimize lead and copper levels at users' taps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State determination regarding source water treatment. The State  shall complete an evaluation of the results of all source water samples  submitted by the water system to determine whether source water  treatment is necessary to minimize lead or copper levels in water  delivered to users' taps. If the State determines that treatment is  needed, the State shall either require installation and operation of the  source water treatment recommended by the system (if any) or require the  installation and operation of another source water treatment from among  the following: Ion exchange, reverse osmosis, lime softening or  coagulation/filtration. If the State requests additional information to  aid in its review, the water system shall provide the information by the  date specified by the State in its request. The State shall notify the  system in writing of its determination and set forth the basis for its  decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Installation of source water treatment. Each system shall  properly install and operate the source water treatment designated by  the State under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State review of source water treatment and specification of  maximum permissible source water levels. The State shall review the  source water samples taken by the water system both before and after the  system installs source water treatment, and determine whether the system  has properly installed and operated the source water treatment  designated by the State. Based upon its review, the State shall  designate the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations for  finished water entering the distribution system. Such levels shall  reflect the contaminant removal capability of the treatment properly  operated and maintained. The State shall notify the system in writing  and explain the basis for its decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Continued operation and maintenance. Each water system shall  maintain lead and copper levels below the maximum permissible  concentrations designated by the State at each sampling point monitored  in accordance with Sec.  141.88. The system is out of compliance with  this paragraph if the level of lead or copper at any sampling point is  greater than the maximum permissible concentration designated by the  State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Modification of State treatment decisions. Upon its own  initiative or in response to a request by a water system or other  interested party, a State may modify its determination of the source  water treatment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or maximum  permissible lead and copper concentrations for finished water entering  the distribution system under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A  request for modification by a system or other interested party shall be  in writing, explain why the modification is appropriate, and provide  supporting documentation. The State may modify its determination where  it concludes that such change is necessary to ensure that the system  continues to minimize lead and copper concentrations in source water. A  revised determination shall be made in writing, set forth the new  treatment requirements, explain the basis for the State's decision, and  provide an implementation schedule for completing the treatment  modifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Treatment decisions by EPA in lieu of the State. Pursuant to the  procedures in Sec.  142.19, the EPA Regional Administrator may review  treatment determinations made by a State under paragraphs (b) (2), (4),  or (6) of this section and issue Federal treatment determinations  consistent with the requirements of those paragraphs where the  Administrator finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A State has failed to issue a treatment determination by the  applicable deadlines contained in Sec.  141.83(a),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A state has abused its discretion in a substantial number of  cases or in cases affecting a substantial population, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The technical aspects of a State's determination would be  indefensible in an expected Federal enforcement action taken against a  system.
