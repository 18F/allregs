or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Changing from a method described in the FSAR to another method  unless that method has been approved by NRC for the intended  application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Facility as described in the final safety analysis report (as  updated) means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The structures, systems, and components (SSC) that are described  in the final safety analysis report (FSAR) (as updated),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The design and performance requirements for such SSCs described  in the FSAR (as updated), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The evaluations or methods of evaluation included in the FSAR  (as updated) for such SSCs which demonstrate that their intended  function(s) will be accomplished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Final Safety Analysis Report (as updated) means the Final Safety  Analysis Report (or Final Hazards Summary Report) submitted in  accordance with Sec. 50.34, as amended and supplemented, and as updated  per the requirements of Sec. 50.71(e) or Sec. 50.71(f), as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Procedures as described in the final safety analysis report (as  updated) means those procedures that contain information described in  the FSAR (as updated) such as how structures, systems, and components  are operated and controlled (including assumed operator actions and  response times).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Tests or experiments not described in the final safety analysis  report (as updated) means any activity where any structure, system, or  component is utilized or controlled in a manner which is either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Outside the reference bounds of the design bases as described in  the final safety analysis report (as updated) or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inconsistent with the analyses or descriptions in the final  safety analysis report (as updated).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section applies to each holder of an operating license  issued under this part or a combined license issued under part 52 of  this chapter, including the holder of a license authorizing operation of  a nuclear power reactor that has submitted the certification of  permanent cessation of operations required under Sec. 50.82(a)(1) or  Sec. 50.110 or a reactor licensee whose license has been   amended to allow possession of nuclear fuel but not operation of the  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A licensee may make changes in the facility as described in  the final safety analysis report (as updated), make changes in the  procedures as described in the final safety analysis report (as  updated), and conduct tests or experiments not described in the final  safety analysis report (as updated) without obtaining a license  amendment pursuant to Sec. 50.90 only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A change to the technical specifications incorporated in the  license is not required, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The change, test, or experiment does not meet any of the  criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A licensee shall obtain a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.90 prior to implementing a proposed change, test, or experiment if  the change, test, or experiment would:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the frequency of  occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the final safety  analysis report (as updated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the likelihood of  occurrence of a malfunction of a structure, system, or component (SSC)  important to safety previously evaluated in the final safety analysis  report (as updated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of  an accident previously evaluated in the final safety analysis report (as  updated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Result in more than a minimal increase in the consequences of a  malfunction of an SSC important to safety previously evaluated in the  final safety analysis report (as updated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Create a possibility for an accident of a different type than  any previously evaluated in the final safety analysis report (as  updated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Create a possibility for a malfunction of an SSC important to  safety with a different result than any previously evaluated in the  final safety analysis report (as updated);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Result in a design basis limit for a fission product barrier  as described in the FSAR (as updated) being exceeded or altered;

These records must include a  written evaluation which provides the bases for the determination that  the change, test, or experiment does not require a license amendment  pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee shall submit, as specified in Sec. 50.4 or Sec.  52.3 of this chapter, as applicable, a report containing a brief  description of any changes, tests, and experiments, including a summary  of the evaluation of each. A report must be submitted at intervals not  to exceed 24 months. For combined licenses, the report must be submitted  at intervals not to exceed 6 months during the period from the date of  application for a combined license to the date the Commission makes its  findings under 10 CFR 52.103(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The records of changes in the facility must be maintained until  the termination of an operating license issued under this part, a  combined license issued under part 52 of this chapter, or the  termination of a license issued under 10 CFR part 54, whichever is  later. Records of changes in procedures and records of tests and  experiments must be maintained for a period of 5 years.
