                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You should seek to obtain what you, with the advice of legal  counsel, judge is needed to ensure future Government use of technology  that emerges from the research, as long as doing so is consistent with  the balance between DoD interests described in Sec. 37.840(b). You  should consider data in which you wish to obtain license rights and data  that you may wish to be delivered; since TIAs are assistance instruments  rather than acquisition instruments, however, it is not expected that  data would be delivered in most cases. What generally is needed is an  irrevocable, world-wide license for the Government to use, modify,  reproduce, release, or disclose for Governmental purposes the data that  are generated under TIAs (including any data, such as computer software,  in which a recipient may obtain a copyright). A Governmental purpose is  any activity in which the United States Government participates, but a  license for Governmental purposes does not include the right to use, or  have or permit others to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose  data for commercial purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You may negotiate licenses of different scope than described in  paragraph (a) of this section when necessary to accomplish program  objectives or to protect the Government's interests. Consult with legal  counsel before negotiating a license of different scope.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In negotiating data rights, you should consider the rights in  background data that are necessary to fully utilize technology that is  expected to result from the TIA, in the event the recipient does not  commercialize the technology or chooses to protect any invention as a  trade secret rather than by a patent. If a recipient intends to protect  any invention as a trade secret, you should consult with your  intellectual property counsel before deciding what information related  to the invention the award should require the recipient to report.</p>
