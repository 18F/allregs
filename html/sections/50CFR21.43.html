You do not need a Federal permit to control the species listed in  paragraph (a) of this section in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where they are causing serious injuries to agricultural or  horticultural crops or to livestock feed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When they cause a health hazard or structural property damage;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To protect a species recognized by the Federal Government as an  endangered, threatened, or candidate species in any county in which it  occurs, as shown in the Service's Environmental Conservation Online  System (http://ecos.fws.gov);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To protect a species recognized by the Federal Government as an  endangered or threatened species in designated critical habitat for the  species; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To protect a species recognized by a State or Tribe as  endangered, threatened, candidate, or of special concern if the control  takes place within that State or on the lands of that tribe,  respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each calendar year, you must attempt to control depredation by  species listed under this depredation order using nonlethal methods  before you may use lethal control. Nonlethal control methods can include  such measures as netting and flagging, the use of trained raptors,  propane cannons, and recordings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions under which control is allowed by Federal, State, and  Tribal employees. You do not need a Federal permit to control the  species listed in   paragraph (a) of this section in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where they are causing serious injuries to agricultural or  horticultural crops or to livestock feed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When they cause a health hazard or structural property damage;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To protect a species recognized by the Federal Government, a  State, or a Tribe as an endangered, threatened, or candidate, species,  or a species of special concern, including critical habitat for any  listed species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each calendar year, you must attempt to control depredation by  species listed under this depredation order using nonlethal methods  before you may use lethal control. Nonlethal control methods can include  such measures as netting and flagging, the use of trained raptors,  propane cannons, and recordings. However, this requirement does not  apply to Federal, State, or Tribal employees conducting brown-headed  cowbird trapping to protect a species recognized by the Federal  Government, a State, or a Tribe as endangered, threatened, candidate, or  of special concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ammunition. In most cases, if you use a firearm to kill  migratory birds under the provisions of this section, you must use  nontoxic shot or nontoxic bullets to do so. See Sec.  20.21(j) of this  chapter for a listing of approved nontoxic shot types. However, this  prohibition does not apply if you use an air rifle or an air pistol for  control of depredating birds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access to control efforts. If you exercise any of the privileges  granted by this section, you must allow any Federal, State, tribal, or  territorial wildlife law enforcement officer unrestricted access at all  reasonable times (including during actual operations) over the premises  on which you are conducting the control. You must furnish the officer  whatever information he or she may require about your control  operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Trapping conditions. You must comply with the following  conditions if you attempt to trap any species under this order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may possess, transport, and use a lure bird or birds of the  species listed in paragraph (a) that you wish to trap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must check each trap at least once every day it is deployed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At temperatures above 80 [deg]Fahrenheit, the traps must provide  shade for captured birds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each trap must contain adequate food and water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must promptly release all healthy nontarget birds that you  capture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a federally permitted wildlife rehabilitator is within 1 hour  or less of your capture efforts, you must send injured or debilitated  nontarget federally protected migratory birds to the rehabilitator. If  no rehabilitator is closer than 1 hour away, you may euthanize an  injured or debilitated bird of a nontarget species unless the species is  federally listed as an endangered, threatened, or candidate species, in  which case you must deliver it to a rehabilitator and report the take to  the nearest U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Field Office or Special  Agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> You must report captures of nontarget federally protected  migratory birds in your annual report (see paragraph (i) of this  section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Euthanasia. Captured birds and wounded or injured birds of the  species listed in paragraph (a) may only be killed by carbon monoxide or  carbon dioxide inhalation, or by cervical dislocation performed by well- trained personnel who are regularly monitored to ensure proficiency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Disposition of birds and parts. You may not sell, or offer to  sell, any bird, or any part thereof, killed under this section, but you  may possess, transport, and otherwise dispose of the bird or its parts,  including transferring them to authorized research or educational  institutions. If not transferred, the bird and its parts must either be  burned, or buried at least 1 mile from the nesting area of any migratory  bird species recognized by the Federal Government, the State, or a Tribe  as an endangered or threatened species.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Annual report. Any person, business, organization, or government  official acting under this depredation order must provide an annual  report using FWS Form 3-202-21-2143 to the appropriate Regional  Migratory Bird Permit Office. The addresses for the   Regional Migratory Bird Permit Offices are provided at 50 CFR 2.2, and  are on the form. The report is due by January 31st of the following year  and must include the information requested on the form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Compliance with other laws. You may trap and kill birds under  this order only in a way that complies with all State, tribal, or  territorial laws or regulations. You must have any State, tribal, or  territorial permit required to conduct the activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Information collection. The Office of Management and Budget has  approved the information collection requirements associated with this  depredation order and assigned OMB Control No. 1018-0146. We may not  conduct or sponsor and you are not required to respond to a collection  of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.  You may send comments on the information collection requirements to the  Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address  provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).  [79 FR 65601, Nov. 5, 2014]</p>
