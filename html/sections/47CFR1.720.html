                            <p class="depth0">Formal complaint proceedings are generally resolved on a written record consisting of a complaint, answer, and joint statement of stipulated facts, disputed facts and key legal issues, along

with all associated affidavits, exhibits and other attachments. Commission proceedings may also require or permit other written submissions such as briefs, written interrogatories, and other supplementary documents or pleadings. Those formal complaint proceedings handled on the Enforcement Bureau's Accelerated Docket are subject to pleading and procedural rules that differ in some respects from the general rules for formal complaint proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pleadings must be clear, concise, and explicit. All matters concerning a claim, defense or requested remedy, including damages, should be pleaded fully and with specificity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pleadings must contain facts which, if true, are sufficient to constitute a violation of the Act or Commission order or regulation, or a defense to such alleged violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Facts must be supported by relevant documentation or affidavit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Legal arguments must be supported by appropriate judicial, Commission, or statutory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Opposing authorities must be distinguished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Copies must be provided of all non-Commission authorities relied upon which are not routinely available in national reporting systems, such as unpublished decisions or slip opinions of courts or administrative agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Parties are responsible for the continuing accuracy and completeness of all information and supporting authority furnished in a pending complaint proceeding. Information submitted, as well as relevant legal authorities, must be current and updated as necessary and in a timely manner at any time before a decision is rendered on the merits of the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Specific reference shall be made to any tariff provision relied on in support of a claim or defense. Copies of relevant tariffs or relevant portions of tariffs that are referred to or relied upon in a complaint, answer, or other pleading shall be appended to such complaint, answer, or other pleading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> All statements purporting to summarize or explain Commission orders or policies must cite, in standard legal form, the Commission ruling upon which such statements are based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Pleadings shall identify the name, address, telephone number, and email address for either the filing party's attorney or, where a party is not represented by an attorney, the filing party.
