The amount of the  additional tax is to be calculated in the same manner as under paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any amount of United States tax is released pursuant to Sec.  513.7(a) by the withholding agent in the United States with respect to a  dividend received by such a person with an address in Ireland, the  latter will also withhold from such released amount any additional  amount of United States tax, otherwise required to be withheld by the  preceding provisions of this section in respect of such dividend, in the  same manner as if at the time of payment of such dividend United States  tax at the rate of only 15 percent had been withheld at source  therefrom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amounts so withheld by such withholding agents in Ireland  will be deposited, without converting such amounts into United States  dollars, with the Irish Revenue Commissioners on or before the 15th day  after the close of the calendar year quarter in which such withholding  in Ireland occurs. Each withholding agent making such deposit will  render therewith the appropriate Irish form as prescribed in regulations  made by the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have  arranged that the amounts so deposited will be remitted by draft in  United States dollars to the District Director of Internal Revenue,  Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A., on or before the end of the calendar month  in which the deposits are made, such draft to be accompanied by the  Irish form rendered by the withholding agents in Ireland in connection  with such deposits.</p>
