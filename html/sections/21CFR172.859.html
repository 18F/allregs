                            <p class="depth0">Sucrose fatty acid esters identified in this section may be safely used in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sucrose fatty acid esters are the mono-, di-, and tri-esters of sucrose with fatty acids and are derived from sucrose and edible tallow or hydrogenated edible tallow or edible vegetable oils. The only solvents which may be used in the preparation of sucrose fatty acid esters are those generally recognized as safe in food or regulated for such use by an appropriate section in this part. Ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone or dimethyl sulfoxide and isobutyl alcohol (2-methyl-1-propanol) may be used in the preparation of sucrose fatty acid esters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sucrose fatty acid esters meet the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total content of mono-, di-, and tri-esters is not less than 80 percent as determined by a method title ``Sucrose Fatty Acid Esters, Method of Assay,'' which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-200), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The acid value is not more than 6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The residue on ignition (sulfated ash) is not more than 2 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The total ethyl acetate content is not more than 350 parts per million as determined by a method titled ``Determination of Ethyl Acetate,'' which is incorporated by reference.
