                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Immediately after the donor provides the urine specimen to the  collector, including specimens of less than 30 mL but greater than 15  mL, the collector shall measure the temperature of the specimen. The  temperature-measuring device used must accurately reflect the  temperature of the specimen and not contaminate the specimen. The time  from urination to temperature measurement may not exceed 4 minutes. If  the temperature of a urine specimen is outside the range of 90 [deg]F to  100 [deg]F (32 [deg]C to 38 [deg]C), that is a reason to believe the  donor may have altered or substituted the specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Immediately after the donor provides a urine specimen, including  specimens of less than 30 mL but equal to or greater than 15 mL, the  collector shall also inspect the specimen to determine its color and  clarity and look for any signs of contaminants or adulteration. The  collector shall note any unusual findings on the custody-and-control  form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there is reason to believe that the donor may have attempted  to dilute, substitute, or adulterate the specimen based on specimen  temperature or other observations made during the collection, the  collector shall contact the designated FFD program manager, who may  consult with the MRO, to determine whether the donor has attempted to  subvert the testing process or whether other circumstances may explain  the observations. The FFD program manager or MRO may require the donor  to provide a second specimen as soon as possible under direct  observation. In addition, the collector shall inform the donor that he  or she may volunteer to submit a second specimen under direct  observation to counter the reason to believe the donor may have altered  or substituted the specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any specimen of 15 mL or more that the collector suspects has  been diluted, substituted, or adulterated, and any specimen of 15 mL or  more that has been collected under direct observation under paragraph  (c) of this section, must be sent directly to the HHS-   certified laboratory for initial and, if required, confirmatory testing,  and may not be subject to initial testing at a licensee testing  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As much of the suspect specimen as possible must be preserved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An acceptable specimen is free of any apparent contaminants,  meets the required basic quantity of at least 30 mL, and is within the  acceptable temperature range.</p>
