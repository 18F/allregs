If an owner's units are not decent,  safe and sanitary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the owner is responsible under the terms of the lease for  correcting the deficiencies, the PHA shall send the owner written  notification requiring the owner to take specified corrective action  within a specified time. The notification shall also state that, if the  owner fails to comply, rent payments will be suspended. If the owner  fails to comply with the first notification, he shall be notified by the  PHA of the noncompliance and rent payments shall be suspended  immediately. In the event of such suspension of rent payments, the PHA  shall requisition a correspondingly lower ACC payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the PHA is responsible under the terms of the lease for  correcting the deficiencies, the Field Office shall send written  notification requiring the PHA to take specified corrective action  within a specified time. The notification shall also state that, if the  PHA fails to comply, HUD will make reduced payments to the PHA only in  the amount of the rent due the owner. If the PHA fails to comply with  the first notification, the PHA shall be notified of the noncompliance,  and the PHA shall not receive any fees for performing management  functions until the PHA has complied with the Field Office request and  has corrected the noted deficiencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Section 23 policies for units not planned to be converted. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  PHAs shall not enter into new leases with owners for additional units  nor shall they   renew or extend leases with owners for more than one year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions contained in paragraphs (e) (3) and (4) of this  section shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Request for rent increases. An owner may submit to the PHA a  request for rent increase because of increases in operating cost, when  the rents to the owner, after adjustments based on provisions in the  lease, are insufficient to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing.  Such a request shall be supported by an audited financial statement, and  the data shall clearly show that failure to obtain additional revenue  will result in deterioriation of units and loss of decent, safe and  sanitary housing for low-income families. The PHA shall inspect the  units to determine whether the units are decent, safe and sanitary.  Where the need for an adjustment under this paragraph is shown:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to available contract authority and prior approval by  the HUD Field Office, the PHA may grant an adjustment to the extent  documented and justified for those items of expenses (excluding debt  service) for which the owner is responsible under the lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the adjustment must be reasonable when compared  with similar items under the Section 8 Existing Housing program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The adjusted amount for expenses shall not exceed the result of  applying the appropriate Section 8 Existing Housing Annual Adjustment  Factor (24 CFR part 888) most recently published by HUD in the Federal  Register to the appropriate expense base in effect under the lease prior  to this adjustment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The adjustment shall not be retroactive to pay for costs that  the owner had previously incurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The adjustment shall be effective for a period not to exceed one  year.
