or abbreviated application was approved, that there is a lack of substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled investigations as defined in Sec.  314.126, that the drug will have the effect it is purported or represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the application or abbreviated application contains any untrue statement of a material fact; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That the patent information prescribed by section 505(c) of the act was not submitted within 30 days after the receipt of written notice from FDA specifying the failure to submit such information; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FDA may notify the applicant, and, if appropriate, all other persons who manufacture or distribute identical, related, or similar drug products as defined in Sec.  310.6, and for a new drug afford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of the application or abbreviated new drug application under section 505(e) of the act and under the procedure in Sec.  314.200, if the agency finds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the applicant has failed to establish a system for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain required records or to make required reports under section 505(k) or 507(g) of the act and Sec.  314.80, Sec.  314.81, or Sec.  314.98, or that the applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying or verification of, its records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That on the basis of new information before FDA, evaluated together with the evidence available when the application or abbreviated application was approved, the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the drug are inadequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity and were not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That on the basis of new information before FDA, evaluated together with the evidence available when the application or abbreviated application was approved, the labeling of the drug, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular, and the labeling was not corrected by the applicant within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the applicant has failed to comply with the notice requirements of section 510(j)(2) of the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That the applicant has failed to submit bioavailability or bioequivalence data required under part 320 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The application or abbreviated application does not contain an explanation of the omission of a report of any investigation of the drug product sponsored by the applicant, or an explanation of the omission of other information about the drug pertinent to an evaluation of the application or abbreviated application that is received or otherwise obtained by the applicant from any source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> That any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the application or abbreviated application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling was not conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations in part 58 of this chapter and no reason for the noncompliance was provided or, if it was, the differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any clinical investigation involving human subjects described in the application or abbreviated application, subject to the institutional review board regulations in part 56 of this chapter or informed consent regulations in part 50 of this chapter, was not conducted in compliance with those regulations such that the rights or safety of human subjects were not adequately protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> That the applicant or contract research organization that conducted a bioavailability or bioequivalence study described in Sec.  320.38 or Sec.  320.63 of this chapter that is contained in the application or abbreviated application refuses to permit an inspection of facilities or records relevant to the study by a properly authorized officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services or refuses to submit

reserve samples of the drug products used in the study when requested by FDA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> That the labeling for the drug product that is the subject of the abbreviated new drug application is no longer consistent with that for the listed drug referred to in the abbreviated new drug application, except for differences approved in the abbreviated new drug application or those differences resulting from:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A patent on the listed drug issued after approval of the abbreviated new drug application; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusivity accorded to the listed drug after approval of the abbreviated new drug application that do not render the drug product less safe or effective than the listed drug for any remaining, nonprotected condition(s) of use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FDA will withdraw approval of an application or abbreviated application if the applicant requests its withdrawal because the drug subject to the application or abbreviated application is no longer being marketed, provided none of the conditions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section applies to the drug. FDA will consider a written request for a withdrawal under this paragraph to be a waiver of an opportunity for hearing otherwise provided for in this section. Withdrawal of approval of an application or abbreviated application under this paragraph is without prejudice to refiling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FDA may notify an applicant that it believes a potential problem associated with a drug is sufficiently serious that the drug should be removed from the market and may ask the applicant to waive the opportunity for hearing otherwise provided for under this section, to permit FDA to withdraw approval of the application or abbreviated application for the product, and to remove voluntarily the product from the market. If the applicant agrees, the agency will not make a finding under paragraph (b) of this section, but will withdraw approval of the application or abbreviated application in a notice published in the Federal Register that contains a brief summary of the agency's and the applicant's views of the reasons for withdrawal.
