The initial decision to deny Temporary Protected Status, a waiver of inadmissibility, or temporary treatment benefits shall be in writing served in person or by mail to the alien's most recent address provided to the Service and shall state the reason(s) for the denial. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the alien will be given written notice of his or her right to appeal.

(1) Temporary treatment benefits shall be evidenced by the issuance of an employment authorization document. The alien shall be given, in English and in the language of the designated foreign state or a language that the alien understands, a notice of the registration requirements for Temporary Protected Status and a notice of the following benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Temporary stay of deportation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Temporary employment authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unless terminated under Sec. 244.13, temporary treatment benefits shall remain in effect until a final decision has been made on the application for Temporary Protected Status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Grant of temporary protected status. (1) The decision to grant Temporary Protected Status shall be evidenced by the issuance of an alien registration document. For those aliens requesting employment authorization, the employment authorization document will act as alien registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The alien shall be provided with a notice, in English and in the language of the designated foreign state or a language that the alien understands, of the following benefits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The alien shall not be deported while maintaining Temporary Protected Status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employment authorization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The privilege to travel abroad with the prior consent of the director as provided in Sec. 244.15;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For the purposes of adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act and change of status under section 248 of the Act, the alien is considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful status as a nonimmigrant while the alien maintains Temporary Protected Status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> An alien eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status under Sec. 244.2(f)(2), who was prevented from filing a late application for registration because the regulations failed to provide him or her with this opportunity, will be considered to have been maintaining lawful status as a nonimmigrant until the benefit is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The benefits contained in the notice are the only benefits the alien is entitled to under Temporary Protected Status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Such notice shall also advise the alien of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The alien must remain eligible for Temporary Protected Status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The alien must register annually with the district office or service center having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The alien's failure to comply with paragraphs (f)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section will result in the withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status, including work authorization granted under this
