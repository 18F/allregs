These  conditions apply to all disposal subject to the MPRSA, namely all  federal projects and non-federal projects greater than 25,000 cubic  yards. All references to ``permittees'' shall be deemed to include the  Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) when it is authorizing its own dredged  material disposal from a USACE dredging project. The conditions for this  designation are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Disposal shall be limited to dredged material from Long Island  Sound and vicinity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Disposal shall comply with conditions set forth in the most  recent approved Site Management and Monitoring Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of this  section, the disposal of dredged material at the CLIS and WLIS sites  pursuant to this designation shall not be allowed beginning eight (8)  years after July 5, 2005 unless a regional dredged material management  plan (DMMP) for Long Island Sound has been completed by the North  Atlantic Division of the USACE, in consultation with the State of New  York, State of Connecticut and EPA,   with a goal of reducing or eliminating the disposal of dredged material  in Long Island Sound, and the EPA thereafter amends this site  designation to incorporate procedures and standards that are consistent  with those recommended in the DMMP. \1\ Completion of the DMMP means  finishing the items listed in the work plan (except for any ongoing  long-term studies), including the identification of alternatives to  open-water disposal, and the development of procedures and standards for  the use of practicable alternatives to open-water disposal. If the  completion of the DMMP does not occur within eight years of July 5, 2005  (plus any extensions under paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(D) and (E) of this  section), use of the sites shall be prohibited. However, if the DMMP is  thereafter completed within one year, disposal of dredged material at  the sites may resume. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ If the EPA has acted in good faith to adopt substantially all  procedures and standards for the use of the sites and the use of  practicable alternatives to open-water disposal recommended in the DMMP,  termination of the use of the sites based on the EPA not adopting all  procedures and standards shall not occur unless a party first files a  petition with the EPA pursuant to item 7 setting forth in detail each  procedure or standard that the party believes the EPA must adopt in  order to be consistent with the DMMP, and the EPA has an opportunity to  act on the petition. Termination of the use of the sites shall not occur  if in response to a petition the EPA determines that it has adopted  substantially all procedures and standards for the use of the sites and  the use of practicable alternatives to open-water disposal recommended  in the DMMP, unless and until otherwise directed by a court. Termination  of the use of the sites shall not occur based on not adopting a DMMP  provision if the DMMP provision is not consistent with applicable law.  Termination of the use of the sites shall not occur based on the EPA not  meeting the 60 and 120 day rulemaking deadlines set forth in item 7, but  use of the sites shall be suspended if the EPA misses either deadline,  until the EPA issues a final rule. Termination of the use of the sites  shall not occur based on the EPA adopting procedures and standards which  are stricter than the recommendations of the DMMP. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The EPA may extend the eight-year deadline in paragraph  (b)(4)(vi)(C) of this section for any reasonable period (on one or more  occasions) if it obtains the written agreement of the USACE, the State  of Connecticut (Department of Environmental Protection) and the State of  New York (Department of State).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The EPA may extend the eight-year deadline in paragraph  (b)(4)(vi)(C) of this section by up to one year (on one occasion only)  if it determines in writing that the parties participating in the  development of the DMMP have attempted in good faith to meet the  deadline, but that the deadline has not been met due to factors beyond  the parties' control (including funding). Such an extension may be in  addition to any extension(s) granted under paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(D) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The EPA will conduct an annual review of progress in developing  the DMMP. If the EPA finds that the DMMP is being unreasonably delayed  by one or more parties, the EPA reserves the right to take the following  actions as appropriate: (1) Suspend use of the sites even prior to the  deadlines established in paragraphs (b)(4)(vi)(C) through (E) of this  section through an amended rulemaking or (2) Exercise through rulemaking  its statutory and regulatory authorities regarding designation of ocean  disposal sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Upon completion of the DMMP, disposal of dredged material at the  designated sites pursuant to the designation in this paragraph (b)(4)  shall be allowed only from permittees that comply with procedures and  standards consistent with the recommendations of the DMMP, and  consistent with applicable law, for the use of the sites and for the use  of practicable alternatives to open-water disposal, so as to reduce or  eliminate the disposal of dredged material in Long Island Sound. Upon  the completion of the DMMP, the EPA will within 60 days propose and  within 120 days (subject to consideration of public comments) issue a  legally binding amendment to the designation in this paragraph (b)(4)  describing all such procedures and standards and specifying that they  must be complied with as part of this designation. \2\ If any   party (or the EPA on its own initiative) is not satisfied that the final  DMMP recommends sufficient procedures and standards to reduce or  eliminate disposal of dredged material in Long Island Sound to the  greatest extent practicable, or if any party is not satisfied with the  EPA's amendment adopting such procedures and standards, the party may  petition the EPA to do a rulemaking to amend the designation to  establish different or additional standards. The EPA will act on any  such petition within 120 days. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ The EPA must preserve its discretion, in response to public  comments, not to adopt such an amendment to this designation. The EPA  understands that the State of New York has reserved its rights to revive  its objection to this designation if the DMMP procedures and standards  are not adopted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Disposal not subject to the restrictions in paragraphs  (b)(4)(vi)(C) through (G) or (b)(4)(vi)(I) of this section shall be  permitted only for materials resulting from currently authorized or  permitted dredging projects at Norwalk, Rye and New Rochelle. Such  disposal must meet all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.  All phases of any of these project must be initiated within four (4)  years from the date of the designation, or the project will become  subject to paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(I) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Except for the projects covered by paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(H) of  this section and until completion of the DMMP, disposal of dredged  material at the designated sites pursuant to the designation in this  paragraph (b)(4) shall be allowed only if, after full consideration of  recommendations provided by an established Regional Dredging Team \3\  (RDT), the USACE finds (and the EPA does not object to such finding),  based on a fully documented analysis, that for a given dredging project: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ A Regional Dredging Team (RDT) comprised of regulatory and  coastal policy specialists from state and federal agencies will be  formed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There are no practicable alternatives (as defined in 40 CFR  227.16(b)) to open-water disposal in Long Island Sound and that any  available practicable alternative to open-water disposal will be fully  utilized for the maximum volume of dredged material practicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determinations relating to paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(I)(1) of this  section will recognize that any alternative to open-water disposal may  add additional costs. Disposal of dredged material at the designated  sites pursuant to this paragraph (b)(4) shall not be allowed if a  practicable alternative is available. Any project subject to this  restriction must be permitted or authorized prior to the completion of  the DMMP and completed within two years after the completion of the  DMMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Disposal shall be limited to dredged sediments that comply with  the Ocean Dumping Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Disposal of dredged material at the designated sites pursuant to  the designation in this paragraph (b)(4) shall not be allowed for any  materials subject to a waiver under 33 U.S.C. 1413(d) unless, for any  project where a waiver is sought, the New England or New York District  of the USACE provides notification, by certified mail at least thirty  (30) days before making the waiver request, to the Governors of the  states of Connecticut and New York and the North Atlantic Division of  the USACE that it will be requesting a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Transportation of dredged material to the sites shall only be  allowed when weather and sea conditions will not interfere with safe  transportation and will not create risk of spillage, leak or other loss  of dredged material in transit. No disposal trips shall be initiated  when the National Weather Service has issued a gale warning for local  waters during the time period necessary to complete dumping operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> The parties participating in the DMMP will need to seek  additional funding in order to develop the DMMP. Nothing in the  designation in this paragraph (b)(4) or elsewhere guarantees that any  agency will be able to obtain funding for the DMMP. This designation  shall not be interpreted as or constitute a commitment that the United  States will obligate or expend funds in contravention of the Anti- Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341. Rather, the sole remedy for any failure  to meet the conditions specified in this paragraph (b)(4)(vi) shall be  the restriction of the authority to dispose of dredged material, as  provided in this paragraph (b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> Nothing in the designation in this paragraph (b)(4) or elsewhere  precludes the EPA from exercising its statutory authority to designate  other ocean disposal sites, not subject to the restrictions in paragraph  (b)(4)(vi), or taking any subsequent action to modify the site  designation in paragraph (b)(4), provided that the EPA makes any such  designation or takes such subsequent action through a separate  rulemaking in accordance with all applicable legal requirements. Nothing  in this designation shall be interpreted to restrict the EPA's  authorities under the MPRSA or the implementing regulations or to amend  the implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Western Long Island Sound Dredged Material Disposal Site (WLIS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Location: Corner Coordinates (NAD 1983) 41[deg]00.1[min] N.,  73[deg]29.8[min] W.;

The SMMP Implementation Manual may be  periodically revised as necessary; proposed revisions to the SMMP  Implementation Manual shall be made following opportunity for public  review and comment. Adherence to the provisions of the most current SMMP  Implementation Manual, including mandatory permit conditions, site  monitoring activities, and any other condition(s) EPA or the Corps have  required as part of the project authorization or permit, is a  requirement for use of the SF-DODS. SF-DODS use shall be subject to the  following restrictions and provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Type and capacity of disposed materials. Site disposal  capacity is 4.8 million cubic yards of suitable dredged material per  year for the remaining period of site designation. This limit is based  on considerations in the regional Long Term Management Strategy for the  placement of dredged material within the San Francisco Bay region, and  on monitoring of site use since the SF-DODS was designated in 1994.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)(C)</em> of this section  describes how alternative permit conditions may be authorized by EPA and  the Corps of Engineers. All references to ``permittees'' shall be deemed  to include the Army Corps of Engineers when implementing a federal  dredging project.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Mandatory conditions. All permits or federal project  authorizations authorizing use of the SF-DODS shall include the  following conditions, unless approval for an alternative permit  condition is sought and granted pursuant to paragraph (l)(3)(viii)(C) of  this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transportation of dredged material to the SF-DODS shall only be  allowed when weather and sea state conditions will not interfere with  safe transportation and will not create risk of spillage, leak or other  loss of dredged material in transit to the SF-DODS. No disposal trips  shall be initiated when the National Weather Service has issued a gale  warning for local waters during the time period necessary to complete  dumping operations, or when wave heights are 16 feet or greater. The  permittee must consult the most current version of the SMMP  Implementation Manual for additional restrictions and/or clarifications  regarding other sea state parameters, including, but not limited to wave  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All vessels used for dredged material transportation and  disposal must be loaded to no more than 80 percent by volume of the  vessel. Before any disposal vessel departs for the SF-DODS, an  independent quality control inspector must certify in writing that the  vessel meets the conditions and requirements of a certification  checklist that contains all of the substantive elements found in the  example contained in the most current SMMP Implementation Manual. For  the purposes of paragraph (l)(3)(viii) of this section, ``independent''  means not an employee of the permittee or dredging contractor; however,  the Corps of Engineers may provide inspectors for Corps of Engineers  dredged material disposal projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dredged material shall not be leaked or spilled from disposal  vessels during transit to the SF-DODS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disposal vessels in transit to and from the SF-DODS should  remain at   least three nautical miles from the Farallon Islands whenever possible.  Closer approaches should occur only in situations where the designated  vessel traffic lane enters the area encompassed by the 3-mile limit, and  where safety may be compromised by staying outside of the 3-mile limit.  In no case may disposal vessels leave the designated vessel traffic  lane.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> When dredged material is discharged within the SF-DODS, no  portion of the vessel from which the materials are to be released (e.g.,  hopper dredge or towed barge) can be further than 1,900 feet (600  meters) from the center of the target area at 37[deg]39[min] N,  123[deg]29[min] W.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No more than one disposal vessel may be present within the  permissible dumping target area referred to in paragraph  (l)(3)(viii)(A)(5) of this section at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Disposal vessels shall use an appropriate navigation system  capable of indicating the position of the vessel carrying dredged  material (for example, a hopper dredged vessel or towed barge) with a  minimum accuracy and precision of 100 feet during all disposal  operations. The system must also indicate the opening and closing of the  doors of the vessel carrying the dredged material. If the positioning  system fails, all disposal operations must cease until the navigational  capabilities are restored. The back-up navigation system, with all the  capabilities listed in this condition, must be in place on the vessel  carrying the dredged material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The permittee shall maintain daily records of the amount of  material dredged and loaded into barges for disposal, the times that  disposal vessel depart for, arrive at and return from the SF-DODS, the  exact locations and times of disposal, and the volumes of material  disposed at the SF-DODS during each vessel trip. The permittee shall  further record wind and sea state observations at intervals to be  established in the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> For each disposal vessel trip, the permittee shall maintain a  computer printout from a Global Positioning System or other acceptable  navigation system showing transit routes and disposal coordinates,  including the time and position of the disposal vessel when dumping was  commenced and completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> An independent quality control inspector (as defined in  paragraph (l)(3)(viii)(A)(2)) of this section shall observe all dredging  and disposal operations. The inspector shall verify the information  required in paragraphs (l)(3)(viii)(A)(8) and (9) of this section. The  inspector shall promptly inform permittees of any inaccuracies or  discrepancies concerning this information and shall prepare summary  reports, which summarize all such inaccuracies and discrepancies, from  time to time as shall be specified in permits. Such summary reports  shall be sent by the permittee to the District Engineer and the Regional  Administrator within a time interval that shall be specified in the  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The permittee shall report any anticipated or actual permit  violations to the District Engineer and the Regional Administrator  within 24 hours of discovering such violation. If any anticipated or  actual permit violations occur within the Gulf of the Farallones or the  Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries, the permittee must also report  any such violation to the respective Sanctuary Manager within 24 hours.  In addition, the permittee shall prepare and submit reports, certified  accurate by the independent quality control inspector, on a frequency  that shall be specified in permits, to the District Engineer and the  Regional Administrator setting forth the information required by  Mandatory Conditions in paragraphs (l)(3)(viii)(A)(8) and (9) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Permittees, and the Corps in its Civil Works projects, must  make arrangements for independent observers to be present on disposal  vessels for the purpose of conducting shipboard surveys of seabirds and  marine mammals. Observers shall employ standardized monitoring  protocols, as referenced in the most current SMMP Implementation Manual.  At a minimum, permittees shall ensure that independent observers are  present on at least one disposal trip during each calendar month that  disposal occurs, AND on average at least once every 25 vessel trips to  the SF-DODS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> At the completion of short-term dredging projects, at least  annually for ongoing projects, and at any other time or interval  requested by the District Engineer or Regional Administrator, permittees  shall prepare and submit to the District Engineer and Regional  Administrator a report that includes complete records of all dredging,  transport and disposal activities, such as navigation logs, disposal  coordinates, scow certification checklists, and other information  required by permit conditions. Electronic data submittals may be  required to conform to a format specified by the agencies. Permittees  shall include a report indicating whether any dredged material was  dredged outside the areas authorized for dredging or was dredged deeper  than authorized for dredging by their permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Project-specific conditions. Permits or federal project  authorizations authorizing use of the SF-DODS may include the following  conditions, if EPA determines these conditions are necessary to  facilitate safe use of the SF-DODS, the prevention of potential harm to  the environment or accurate monitoring of site use:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Permittees may be required to limit the speed of disposal  vessels in transit to the SF-DODS to a rate that is safe under the  circumstances and will prevent the spillage of dredged materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Permittees may be required to use automated data logging systems  for recording navigation and disposal coordinates and/or load levels  throughout disposal trips when such systems are feasible and represent  an improvement over manual recording methodologies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any other conditions that EPA or the Corps of Engineers  determine to be necessary or appropriate to facilitate compliance with  the requirements of the MPRSA and this section may be included in site  use permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Alternative permit/project conditions. Alternatives to the  permit conditions specified in paragraph (l)(3)(viii) of this section in  a permit or federal project authorization may be authorized if the  permittee demonstrates to the District Engineer and the Regional  Administrator that the alternative conditions are sufficient to  accomplish the specific intended purpose of the permit condition in  issue and further demonstrates that the waiver will not increase the  risk of harm to the environment, the health or safety of persons, nor  will impede monitoring of compliance with the MPRSA, regulations  promulgated under the MPRSA, or any permit issued under the MPRSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Site monitoring. Data shall be collected in accordance with a  three-tiered site monitoring program which consists of three  interdependent types of monitoring for each tier: Physical, chemical and  biological. In addition, periodic confirmatory monitoring concerning  potential site contamination shall be performed. Specific guidance for  site monitoring tasks required by this paragraph shall be described in a  Site Management and Monitoring Implementation Manual (SMMP  Implementation Manual) developed by EPA. The SMMP Implementation Manual  shall be reviewed periodically and any necessary revisions to the Manual  will be issued for public review under an EPA Public Notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Tier 1 monitoring activities. Tier 1 monitoring activities shall  consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical monitoring. Tier 1 Physical Monitoring shall consist of  a physical survey to map the area on the seafloor within and in the  vicinity of the disposal site where dredged material has been deposited  (the footprint). Such a survey shall use appropriate technology (for  example, sediment profile photography) to determine the areal extent and  thickness of the disposed dredged material, and to determine if any  dredged material has deposited outside of the disposal site boundary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemical monitoring. Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring shall consist of  collecting, processing, and preserving boxcore samples of sediments so  that such sediments could be subjected to sediment chemistry analysis in  the appropriate tier. Samples shall be collected within the dredged  material footprint, outside of the dredged material footprint, and  outside of the disposal site boundaries. Samples within the footprint  shall be subjected to   chemical analysis in annual Tier 1 activity. Samples from outside of the  footprint and outside of the disposal site boundaries shall be archived  and analyzed only when the criteria requiring Tier 2 as specified in  paragraph (l)(3)(x) of this section are met. A sufficient number of  samples shall be collected so that the potential for adverse impacts due  to elevated chemistry can be assessed with an appropriate time-series or  ordinal technique.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Biological monitoring. Tier 1 Biological Monitoring shall have  two components: Monitoring of pelagic communities and monitoring of  benthic communities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pelagic communities. Tier 1 Biological Monitoring shall include  regional surveys of seabirds, marine mammals and mid-water column fish  populations appropriate for evaluating how these populations might be  affected by disposal site use. A combination of annual regional and  periodic (random) shipboard surveys of seabirds and marine mammals will  be used. The regional survey designs for each category of biota shall be  similar to that used for the regional characterization studies  referenced in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for Designation  of a Deep Water Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site off San Francisco,  California (August 1993) with appropriate realignments to accommodate  transects within and in the vicinity of the SF-DODS. The periodic  shipboard surveys shall be performed from vessels involved in dredged  material disposal operations at the SF-DODS as specified in permit  conditions imposed pursuant to paragraph (l)(3)(viii)(A)(12) of this  section. The minimum number of surveys must be sufficient to  characterize the disposal operations for each project, and, as  practicable, provide seasonal data for an assessment of the potential  for adverse impacts for the one-year period. An appropriate time-series  (ordinal), and community analysis shall be performed using data  collected during the current year and previous years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benthic communities. Tier 1 Biological Monitoring shall include  collection and preservation of boxcore samples of benthic communities so  that such samples could be analyzed as a Tier 2 activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Annual reporting. The results of the annual Tier 1 studies shall  be compiled in an annual report which will be available for public  review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tier 2 monitoring activities. Tier 2 monitoring activities shall  consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical monitoring. Tier 2 Physical Monitoring shall consist of  oceanographic studies conducted to validate and/or improve the models  used to predict the dispersion in the water column and deposition of  dredged material on the seafloor at the SF-DODS. The appropriate  physical oceanographic studies may include: The collection of additional  current meter data, deployment of sediment traps, and deployment of  surface and subsurface drifters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemical monitoring. Tier 2 Chemical Monitoring shall consist of  performing sediment chemistry analysis on samples collected and  preserved in Tier 1 from outside of the footprint and outside of the  disposal site boundaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Biological monitoring. Tier 2 Biological Monitoring shall  involve monitoring of pelagic communities and monitoring of benthic  communities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pelagic communities. Tier 2 Biological Monitoring for pelagic  communities shall include supplemental surveys of similar type to those  in Tier 1, or other surveys as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benthic communities. Tier 2 Biological Monitoring for benthic  communities shall include a comparison of the benthic community within  the dredged material footprint to benthic communities in adjacent areas  outside of the dredged material footprint. An appropriate time-series  (ordinal) and community analysis shall be performed using data collected  during the current year and previous years to determine whether there  are adverse changes in the benthic populations outside of the disposal  site which may endanger the marine environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Annual reporting. The results of any required Tier 2 studies  shall be compiled in an annual report which will be available for public  review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tier 3 monitoring activities. Tier 3 monitoring activities shall  consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Physical monitoring. Tier 3 physical monitoring shall consist of  advanced oceanographic studies to study the dispersion of dredged  material in the water column and the deposition of dredged material on  the seafloor in the vicinity of the SF-DODS. Such physical monitoring  may include additional, intensified studies involving the collection of  additional current meter data, deployment of sediment traps, and  deployment of surface and subsurface drifters. Such studies may include  additional sampling stations, greater frequency of sampling, more  advanced sampling methodologies or equipment, or other additional  increased study measures compared to similar studies conducted in Tier 1  or 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemical monitoring. Tier 3 Chemical Monitoring shall consist of  analysis of tissues of appropriate field-collected benthic and/or  epifaunal organisms to determine bioaccumulation of contaminants that  may be associated with dredged materials deposited at the SF-DODS.  Sampling and analysis shall be designed and implemented to determine  whether the SF-DODS is a source of adverse bioaccumulation in the  tissues of benthic species collected at or outside the SF-DODS, compared  to adjacent unimpacted areas, which may endanger the marine environment.  Appropriate sampling methodologies for these tests will be determined  and the appropriate analyses will involve the assessment of benthic body  burdens of contaminants and correlation with comparison of the benthic  communities inside and outside of the sediment footprint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Biological monitoring. Tier 3 biological monitoring shall have  two components: monitoring of pelagic communities and monitoring of  benthic communities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pelagic communities. Tier 3 Biological Monitoring shall include  advanced studies of seabirds, marine mammals and mid-water column fish  to evaluate how these populations might be affected by disposal site  use. Such studies may include additional sampling stations, greater  frequency of sampling, more advanced sampling methodologies or  equipment, or other additional increased study measures compared to  similar studies conducted in Tier 1 or 2. Studies may include evaluation  of sub-lethal changes in the health of pelagic organisms, such as the  development of lesions, tumors, developmental abnormality, decreased  fecundity or other adverse sub-lethal effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benthic communities. Tier 3 Biological Monitoring shall include  advanced studies of benthic communities to evaluate how these  populations might be affected by disposal site use. Such studies may  include additional sampling stations, greater frequency of sampling,  more advanced sampling methodologies or equipment, or other additional  increased study measures compared to similar studies conducted in Tier  2. Studies may include evaluation of sub-lethal changes in the health of  benthic organisms, such as the development of lesions, tumors,  developmental abnormality, decreased fecundity or other adverse sub- lethal effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reporting. The results of any required Tier 3 studies shall be  compiled in a report which will be available for public review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Periodic confirmatory monitoring. At least once every three  years, the following confirmatory monitoring activities will be  conducted and results compiled in a report which will be available for  public review: Samples of sediments taken from the dredged material  footprint shall be subjected to bioassay testing using one or more  appropriate sensitive marine species consistent with applicable ocean  disposal testing guidance (``Green Book'' or related Regional  Implementation Agreements), as determined by the Regional Administrator,  to confirm whether contaminated sediments are being deposited at the SF- DODS despite extensive pre-disposal testing. In addition, near-surface  arrays of appropriate filter-feeding organisms (such as mussels) shall  be deployed in at least three locations in and around the disposal site  for at least one month during active site use, to confirm whether  substantial bioaccumulation of contaminants may be associated with  exposure to suspended sediment plumes from multiple disposal events. One  array must be deployed outside the influence of any expected plumes to  serve as a baseline reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Site management actions. Once disposal operations at the site  begin, the three-tier monitoring program described in paragraphs  (l)(3)(ix) (A) through (C) of this section shall be implemented on an  annual basis, through December 31, 1998, independent of the actual  volumes disposed at the site. Thereafter, the Regional Administrator may  establish a minimum annual disposal volume (not to exceed 10 percent of  the designated site capacity at any time) below which this monitoring  program need not be fully implemented. The Regional Administrator shall  promptly review monitoring reports for the SF-DODS along with any other  information available to the Regional Administrator concerning site  monitoring activities. If the information gathered from monitoring at a  given monitoring tier is not sufficient for the Regional Administrator  to base reasonable conclusions as to whether disposal at the SF-DODS  might be endangering the marine ecosystem, then the Regional  Administrator shall require intensified monitoring at a higher tier. If  monitoring at a given tier establishes that disposal at the SF-DODS is  endangering the marine ecosystem, then the Regional Administrator shall  require modification, suspension or termination of site use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(4)</em> of this section has not been deposited or  transported outside of the site boundaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Chemical monitoring. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Chemical monitoring shall remain  limited to Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring when the results of Physical  Monitoring indicate that a significant amount of dredged material as  defined in paragraph (l)(3)(x)(A)(4) of this section has not been  deposited or transported off-site, and Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring  establishes that dredged sediments deposited at the disposal site do not  contain levels of chemical contaminants that are significantly elevated  above the range of chemical contaminant levels in dredged sediments that  the Regional Administrator and the District Engineer found to be  suitable for disposal at the SF-DODS pursuant to 40 CFR part 227.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tier 2 monitoring shall be employed when the results of  Physical Monitoring indicate that a significant amount of dredged  material as defined in paragraph (l)(3)(x)(A)(4) of this section has  been deposited off-site, and Tier 1 Chemical Monitoring is insufficient  to establish that dredged sediments deposited at the disposal site do  not contain levels of chemical contaminants that are significantly  elevated above the range of chemical contaminant levels in dredged  sediments that the Regional Administrator and the District Engineer  found to be suitable for disposal at the SF-DODS pursuant to 40 CFR part  227.</p><p class="depth0">The Regional Administrator may employ Tier 2 monitoring when  available evidence indicates that a significant amount of dredged  material as defined in paragraph (l)(3)(x)(A)(4) of this section has  been deposited near the SF-DODS site boundary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tier 3 monitoring shall be employed within and outside the  dredged material footprint when Tier 2 Chemical Monitoring is  insufficient to establish that dredged sediments deposited at the  disposal site do not contain levels of chemical contaminants that are  significantly elevated above the range of chemical contaminant levels in  dredged sediments that the Regional Administrator and the District  Engineer found to be suitable for disposal at the SF-DODS pursuant to 40  CFR part 227.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Biological monitoring. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pelagic communities. Biological  monitoring for pelagic communities shall remain limited to Tier 1  monitoring when Tier 1 monitoring establishes that disposal at the SF- DODS has not endangered the monitored pelagic communities. When Tier 1  monitoring is insufficient to make reasonable conclusions whether  disposal at the site has endangered the monitored pelagic communities,  then Tier 2 monitoring of pelagic communities shall be employed. When  Tier 2   monitoring is insufficient to make reasonable conclusions whether  disposal at the site has endangered the monitored pelagic communities,  then Tier 3 monitoring of pelagic communities shall be employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Benthic communities. Biological monitoring for benthic  communities shall remain limited to Tier 1 monitoring when physical  monitoring establishes that a significant amount of dredged material has  not been deposited outside of the site boundaries. If physical  monitoring indicates that a significant amount of dredged material has  been deposited or transported outside of the site boundaries, then Tier  2 analysis of benthic communities shall be performed. If Chemical  Monitoring establishes that there is significant bioaccumulation of  contaminants in organisms sampled from within or outside the dredged  material footprint, then Tier 3 Biological Monitoring of the disposal  site shall be employed. Tier 3 Biological Monitoring may replace Tier 3  Chemical Monitoring if observed biological effects are established as  surrogate indicators for bioaccumulation of chemical contaminants in  sampled organisms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definition of significant dredged material accumulation. For  purposes of this paragraph (l)(3)(x)(A) of this section, dredged  material accumulation on the ocean bottom to a thickness of five  centimeters shall be considered to be a significant amount of dredged  material.
