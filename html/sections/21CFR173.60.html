                            <p class="depth0">Dimethylamine-epichlorohydrin copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 25988-97-0) may be safely used in food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The food additive is produced by copolymerization of dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin in which not more than 5 mole-percent of dimethylamine may be replaced by an equimolar amount of ethylenediamine, and in which the mole ratio of total amine to epichlorohydrin is approximately 1:1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The additive meets the following specifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nitrogen content of the copolymer is 9.4 to 10.8 weight percent on a dry basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A 50-percent-by-weight aqueous solution of the copolymer has a minimum viscosity of 175 centipoises at 25 C as determined by LVT-series Brookfield viscometer using a No. 2 spindle at 60 RPM (or by another equivalent method).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The additive contains not more than 1,000 parts per million of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol and not more than 10 parts per million epichlorohydrin. The epichlorohydrin and 1,3-dichloro-2-

propanol content is determined by an analytical method entitled ``The Determination of Epichlorohydrin and 1,3-Dichloro-2-Propanol in Dimethylamine-Epichlorohydrin Copolymer,'' which is incorporated by reference.

It is added only at the defecation/clarification stage of sugar liquor refining at a concentration not to exceed 150 parts per million of copolymer by weight of sugar solids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To assure safe use of the additive, the label and labeling of the additive shall bear, in addition to other information required by the Act, adequate directions to assure use in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section.
