Averaging of credits in this manner is used to determine compliance under Sec. 90.207(b). A manufacturer may have a negative balance of credits as allowed under Sec. 90.207(c)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cross-class averaging of credits is allowed across all classes of nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credits used in averaging for a given model year may be obtained from credits generated in the same model year by another engine family, credits banked in previous model years, or credits of the same or previous model year obtained through trading subject to the provisions of Sec. 90.205(a). Credits generated under the previously available ``Optional transition year averaging, banking, and trading program for Phase 2 handheld engines'' of Secs. 90.212 through 90.220, since repealed, may also be used in averaging. The restrictions of this paragraph notwithstanding, credits from a given model year may be used to address credit needs of previous model year engines as allowed under Sec. 90.207(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The use of credits generated under the early banking provisions of Sec. 90.205(b) is subject to regulations under this subpart.
