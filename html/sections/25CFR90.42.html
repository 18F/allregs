The supervisor or the assistant supervisor in the presence of at least two judges shall unlock the locked box containing the absentee ballots and shall then determine whether the person whose name is signed to the statement is a qualified voter of the Osage Tribe and check said voter off the poll list before opening the outer envelope. After it has been determined which of the absentee ballots have been cast by duly qualified electors, the supervisor in the presence of the election board shall cause the valid ballots in the sealed inner envelopes to be placed in the ballot box.
