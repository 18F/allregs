Such entries shall reflect a drying or blending shrinkage as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When the warehouse receipt shows that the commodity contained excess moisture and the commodity has been dried or blended, the supplemental certificate must show the grade, grading factors, and quantity after drying or blending of the commodity.
