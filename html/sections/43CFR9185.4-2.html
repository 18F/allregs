                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Necessity. The applicants for the resurvey of any township are  required to present satisfactory prima facie evidence of the necessity  for such action. In general, it must be shown that the evidences of the  original survey are so widely obliterated or that the prevailing survey  conditions are so grossly defective as to preclude the satisfactory  identification of the subdivisions of the subsisting survey or that the  evidences of the original survey are in such an advanced state of  deterioration that action looking to their preservation and perpetuation  is expedient as in the public interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ownership of land. The applicants for resurvey are required to  preface their petition by the statement that the extent of privately  owned lands within the township is in excess of 50 percent of the total  area thereof. If necessary, information in this connection may be  obtained by the petitioners from the manager of the land office having  local jurisdiction. Failure to comply with the condition set forth in  this section or material error in the showing made, will not only result  in delaying action upon the petition, but may require its rejection if  it is found that the township is not properly subject to resurvey under  the terms of the governing Act.</p>
