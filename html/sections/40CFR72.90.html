Sec. 72.91(a) and 72.92(a) of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the unit is governed by an approved Phase I extension plan,  then the information in accordance with Sec. 72.93 of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the designated representative's option, the total number of  allowances to be deducted for the year, using the formula in Sec. 72.95  of this part, and the serial numbers of the allowances that are to be  deducted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> At the designated representative's option, for units that share  a common stack and whose emissions of sulfur dioxide are not monitored  separately or apportioned in accordance with part 75 of this chapter,  the percentage of the total number of allowances under paragraph (b)(4)  of this section for all such units that is to be deducted from each  unit's compliance subaccount; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The compliance certification under paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual compliance certification. In the annual compliance  certification report under paragraph (a) of this section, the designated  representative   shall certify, based on reasonable inquiry of those persons with primary  responsibility for operating the source and the affected units at the  source in compliance with the Acid Rain Program, whether each affected  unit for which the compliance certification is submitted was operated  during the calendar year covered by the report in compliance with the  requirements of the Acid Rain Program applicable to the unit, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the unit was operated in compliance with the applicable  Acid Rain emissions limitations, including whether the unit held  allowances, as of the allowance transfer deadline, in its compliance  subaccount (after accounting for any allowance deductions under  Sec. 73.34(c) of this chapter) not less than the unit's total sulfur  dioxide emissions during the calendar year covered by the annual report;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the monitoring plan that governs the unit has been  maintained to reflect the actual operation and monitoring of the unit  and contains all information necessary to attribute monitored emissions  to the unit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether all the emissions from the unit, or a group of units  (including the unit) using a common stack, were monitored or accounted  for through the missing data procedures and reported in the quarterly  monitoring reports, including whether conditionally valid data, as  defined in Sec. 72.2, were reported in the quarterly report. If  conditionally valid data were reported, the owner or operator shall  indicate whether the status of all conditionally valid data has been  resolved and all necessary quarterly report resubmissions have been  made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the facts that form the basis for certification of each  monitor at the unit or a group of units (including the unit) using a  common stack or for using an Acid Rain Program excepted monitoring  method or approved alternative monitoring method, if any, has changed;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a change is required to be reported under paragraph (c)(4) of  this section, specify the nature of the change, the reason for the  change, when the change occurred, and how the unit's compliance status  was determined subsequent to the change, including what method was used  to determine emissions when a change mandated the need for monitor  recertification.
