                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Airport layout plan. As used in this part, ``airport layout  plan'' means the basic plan for the layout of an eligible airport that  shows, as a minimum--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The present boundaries of the airport and of the offsite areas  that the sponsor owns or controls for airport purposes, and of their  proposed additions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The location and nature of existing and proposed airport  facilities (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings,  hangars, and roads) and of their proposed modifications and extensions;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The location of existing and proposed non-aviation areas, and of  their existing improvements.  All airport development under the Federal-aid Airport Program must be  done in accordance with an approved airport   layout plan. Each airport layout plan, and any change in it, is subject  to FAA approval. The Administrator's signature on the face of an  original airport layout plan, or of any change in it, indicates FAA  approval. The FAA approves an airport layout plan only if the airport  development is sound and meets applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Safe, useful, and usable unit. Except as provided in paragraph  (d) of this section, each advance planning and engineering proposal or  airport development project must provide for the planning or development  of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An airport or unit of an airport that is safe, useful, and  usable; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An additional facility that increases the safety, usefulness, or  usability of an airport.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National defense needs. The needs of national defense are fully  considered in administering the Federal-aid Airport Program. However,  approval of an advance planning and engineering proposal or a project  application is limited to planning or airport development necessary for  civil aviation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stage development. In any case in which airport development can  be accomplished more economically under stage construction, federal  funds may be programmed in advance for the development over two or more  years under two or more grant agreements. In such a case, the FAA makes  a tentative allocation of funds for both the current and future fiscal  years, rather than allocating the entire federal share in one fiscal  year. A grant agreement is made only during the fiscal year in which  funds are authorized to be obligated. Advance planning and engineering  grants are not made under this paragraph.
