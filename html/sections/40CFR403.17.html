Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bypass not violating applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. An Industrial User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice.

A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Control Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Prohibition of bypass.
