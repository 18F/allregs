For claims on which suit  is filed before final action, see Sec. 536.66. A settlement authority  may deny or pay in full or in part any claim in a stated amount within  his or her delegated authority. An approval authority may pay in full or  in part, but may not deny, a claim in a stated amount within his or her  delegated authority. If any one claim arising out of the same incident  exceeds a settlement or approval authority's monetary jurisdiction, all  claims from that incident will be forwarded to the authority having  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any claim which must be supported by an expert opinion as to  duty, negligence, causation or damages, an expert opinion must be  submitted upon request. All opinions must meet the standards set forth  in Federal Rule of Evidence 702.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An action memorandum is required for all final actions  regardless of whether payment is made electronically. The memorandum  will contain a sufficient rendition of the facts, law or damages to  justify the action being taken. (A model action is posted on the USARCS  Web site; for the address see Sec. 536.2(a).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Memorandum of Opinion. Upon completion of the investigation, the   ACO or CPO will prepare a memorandum of opinion in the format prescribed  at DA Pam 27-162, when a claim is forwarded to USARCS for action. This  requirement can be waived by the USARCS AAO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claim brought by a claims authority or superior. A claim filed  by an approval or settlement authority or his or her superior officer in  the chain of command or a family member of either will be investigated  and forwarded for final action, without recommendation, to the next  higher settlement authority (in an overseas area, this includes a  command claims service) or to USARCS.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 536.62: For further discussion see DA Pam 27-162,  paragraph 2-72.</p>
