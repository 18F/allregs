                                Sec.  3.812  Special allowance payable under section 156 of
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of this section apply to the payment of a special  allowance to certain surviving spouses and children of individuals who  died on active duty prior to August 13, 1981, or who died as a result of  a service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to  August 13, 1981. This special allowance is a replacement for certain  social security benefits which were either reduced or terminated by  provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A determination must first be made  that the person on whose earnings record the claim is based either died  on active duty prior to August 13, 1981, or died as a result of a  service-connected disability which was incurred or aggravated prior to  August 13, 1981. For purposes of this determination, character of  discharge is not a factor for consideration, and death on active duty  subsequent to August 12, 1981, is qualifying provided that the death  resulted from a service-connected disability which was incurred or  aggravated prior to August 13, 1981.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Once a favorable determination has been made under paragraph  (a)(1) of this section, determinations as to the age, relationship and  school attendance requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1)  of section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377 will be made. In making these  eligibility determinations VA shall apply the provisions of the Social  Security Act, and any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, as in  effect during the claimant's period of eligibility. Unless otherwise  provided in this section, when issues are raised concerning eligibility  or entitlement to this special allowance which cannot be appropriately  resolved under the provisions of the Social Security Act, or the  regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the provisions of title 38,  Code of Federal Regulations, are for application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of payment rate--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basic entitlement rate. A basic  entitlement rate will be computed for each eligible claimant in  accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of  section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377 using data to be provided by the Social  Security Administration. This basic entitlement rate will then be used  to compute the monthly payment rate as described in paragraphs (b)(2) to  (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Original or reopened awards to surviving spouses. The monthly  payment rate shall be equal to the basic entitlement rate increased by  the overall average percentage (rounded to the nearest tenth of a  percent) of each legislative increase in dependency and indemnity  compensation rates under 38 U.S.C. 1311 which became effective  concurrently with or subsequent to the effective date of the earliest  adjustment under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act that was  disregarded in computing the basic entitlement rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Original and reopened awards to children. The monthly payment  rate shall be equal to the basic entitlement rate increased by the  overall average percentage (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent)  of each legislative increase in the rates of educational assistance  allowance under 38 U.S.C. 3531(b) which became effective concurrently  with or subsequent to the effective date of the earliest adjustment  under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act that was disregarded in  computing the basic entitlement rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subsequent legislative increases in rates. The monthly rate of  special allowance payable to a surviving spouse shall be increased by  the same overall average percentage increase (rounded to the nearest  tenth of a percent) and on the same effective date as any legislative  increase in the rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 1311. The monthly rate of  special allowance payable to a child shall be increased by the same  overall average percentage increase (rounded to the nearest tenth of a  percent) and on the same effective date as any legislative increase in  the rates payable under 38 U.S.C. 3531(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Amendment of awards. Prompt action shall be taken to amend any  award of this special allowance to conform with evidence indicating a  change in basic eligibility, any basic entitlement rate, or any  effective date previously determined. It is the claimant's  responsibility to promptly notify VA of   any change in their status or employment which affects eligibility or  entitlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rounding of monthly rates. Any monthly rate computed under the  provisions of this paragraph, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded  to the next lower multiple of $1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claimants not entitled to this special allowance. The following  are not entitled to this special allowance for the reasons indicated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claimants eligible for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151. The  deaths in such cases are not service-connected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claimants eligible for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1318. The  deaths in such cases are not service connected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Claimants whose claims are based on an individual's service in:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines while such forces were  in the service of the Armed Forces pursuant to the military order of the  President dated July 26, 1941, including recognized guerrilla forces  (see 38 U.S.C. 107).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Philippine Scouts under section 14, Pub. L. 190, 79th  Congress (see 38 U.S.C. 107).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The commissioned corps of the Public Health Service  (specifically excluded by section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (specifically excluded by section 156 of Pub. L. 97-377).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Appellate jurisdiction. VA shall have appellate jurisdiction of  all determinations made in connection with this special allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Claims. Claimants must file or submit a complete claim on a  paper or electronic form prescribed by the Secretary in order for VA to  pay this special allowance. When VA receives an intent to file a claim  or inquiries as to eligibility, VA will follow the procedures outlined  in Sec.  3.155. Otherwise, the date of receipt of the complete claim  will be accepted as the date of claim for this special allowance. See  Sec. Sec.  3.150, 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Retroactivity and effective dates. There is no time limit for  filing a claim for this special allowance. Upon the filing of a complete  claim, benefits shall be payable for all periods of eligibility  beginning on or after the first day of the month in which the claimant  first became eligible for this special allowance, except that no payment  may be made for any period prior to January 1, 1983.
