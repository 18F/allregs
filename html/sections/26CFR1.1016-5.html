                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certain stock distributions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of stock, the cost  or other basis must be diminished by the amount of distributions  previously made which, under the law applicable to the year in which the  distribution was made, either were tax free or were applicable in  reduction of basis (not including distributions made by a corporation  which was classified as a personal service corporation under the  provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) or the Revenue Act  of 1921 (42 Stat. 227), out of its earnings or profits which were  taxable in accordance with the provisions of section 218 of the Revenue  Act of 1918 or the Revenue Act of 1921). For adjustments to basis in the  case of certain corporate distributions, see section 301 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example: A, who makes his returns upon the calendar year basis,  purchased stock in 1923 for $5,000. He received in 1924 a distribution  of $2,000 paid out of earnings and profits of the corporation  accumulated before March 1, 1913. The adjusted basis for determining the  gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of the stock in 1954 is  $5,000 less $2,000, or $3,000, and the amount of the gain or loss from  the sale or other disposition of the stock is the difference between  $3,000 and the amount realized from the sale or other disposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amortizable bond premium--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A holder's basis in a  bond is reduced by the amount of bond premium used to offset qualified  stated interest income under Sec. 1.171-2. This reduction occurs when  the holder takes the qualified stated interest into account under the  holder's regular method of accounting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rules for taxable bonds. A holder's basis in a taxable  bond is reduced by the amount of bond premium allowed as a deduction  under Sec. 1.171-3(c)(5)(ii) (relating to the issuer's call of a  taxable bond) or under Sec. 1.171-2(a)(4)(i)(A) (relating to excess  bond premium).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for tax-exempt obligations. A holder's basis in a  tax-exempt obligation is reduced by the amount of excess bond premium  that is treated as a nondeductible loss under Sec. 1.171-2(a)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Municipal bonds. In the case of a municipal bond (as defined in  section 75(b)), basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in  section 75 or as provided in section 22(o) of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1939, and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sale or exchange of residence. Where the acquisition of a new  residence results in the nonrecognition of any part of the gain on the  sale, or exchange, or involuntary conversion of the old residence, the  basis of the new residence shall be reduced by the amount of the gain  not so recognized pursuant to section 1034(a), or section 112(n) of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and the regulations thereunder. See  section 1034(e) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Loans from Commodity Credit Corporation. In the case of property  pledged to the Commodity Credit Corporation, the basis of such property  shall be increased by the amount received as a loan from such  corporation and treated by the taxpayer as income for the year in which  received under section 77, or under section 123 of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939. The basis of such property shall be reduced to the extent  of any deficiency on such loan with respect to which the taxpayer has  been relieved from liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deferred development and exploration expenses. Expenditures for  development and exploration of mines or mineral deposits treated as  deferred expenses under sections 615 and 616, or under the corresponding  provisions of prior income tax laws, are chargeable to capital account  and shall be an adjustment to the basis of the property to which they  relate. The basis so adjusted shall be reduced by the amount of such  expenditures allowed as deductions which results in a reduction for any  taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than   chapter 2 relating to tax on self-employment income) of the Code, or  prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws, but not less than  the amounts allowable under such provisions for the taxable year and  prior years. This amount is considered as the tax-benefit amount allowed  and shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.1016-3. For example, if a taxpayer purchases unexplored and  undeveloped mining property for $1,000,000 and at the close of the  development stage has incurred exploration and development costs of  $9,000,000 treated as deferred expenses, the basis of such property at  such time for computing gain or loss will be $10,000,000. Assuming that  the taxpayer in this example has operated the mine for several years and  has deducted allowable percentage depletion in the amount of $2,000,000  and has deducted allowable deferred exploration and development  expenditures of $2,000,000, the basis of the property in the taxpayer's  hands for purposes of determining gain or loss from a sale will be  $6,000,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Sale of land with unharvested crop. In the case of an  unharvested crop which is sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted  with the land and which is considered as property used in the trade or  business under section 1231, the basis of such crop shall be increased  by the amount of the items which are attributable to the production of  such crop and which are disallowed, under section 268, as deductions in  computing taxable income. The basis of any other property shall be  decreased by the amount of any such items which are attributable to such  other property, notwithstanding any provisions of section 1016 or of  this section to the contrary. For example, if the items attributable to  the production of an unharvested crop consist only of fertilizer costing  $100 and $50 depreciation on a tractor used only to cultivate such crop,  and such items are disallowed under section 268, the adjustments to the  basis of such crop shall include an increase of $150 for such items and  the adjustments to the basis of the tractor shall incude a reduction of  $50 for depreciation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Consent dividends. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of amounts specified in a  shareholder's consent to which section 28 of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1939 applies, the basis of the consent stock shall be increased to  the extent provided in subsection (h) of such section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, is treated as contributed to the capital of the  corporation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Stock in foreign personal holding company. In the case of the  stock of a United States shareholder in a foreign personal holding  company, basis shall be adjusted to the extent provided in section  551(f) or corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Research and experimental expenditures. Research and  experimental expenditures treated as deferred expenses under section  174(b) are chargeable to capital account and shall be an adjustment to  the basis of the property to which they relate. The basis so adjusted  shall be reduced by the amount of such expenditures allowed as  deductions which results in a reduction for any taxable year of the  taxpayer's taxes under subtitle A (other than chapter 2 relating to tax  on self-employment income) of the Code, or prior income, war-profits, or  excess-profits tax laws, but not less than the amounts allowable under  such provisions for the taxable year and prior years. This amount is  considered as the tax-benefit amount allowed and shall be determined in  accordance with paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1016-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Deductions disallowed in connection with disposal of coal or  domestic iron ore. Basis shall be adjusted by the amount of the  deductions disallowed under section 272 with respect to the disposal of  coal or domestic iron ore covered by section 631.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Expenditures attributable to grants or loans covered by section  621. In the case of expenditures attributable to a grant or loan made to  a taxpayer by the United States for the encouragement of exploration  for, or development or mining of, critical and strategic minerals or  metals, basis shall be   adjusted to the extent provided in section 621, or in section 22(b)(15)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Trademark and trade name expenditures. Trademark and trade name  expenditures treated as deferred expenses under section 177 are  chargeable to capital account and shall be an adjustment to the basis of  the property to which they relate. The basis so adjusted shall be  reduced by the amount of such expenditures allowed as deductions which  results in a reduction for any taxable year of the taxpayer's taxes  under subtitle A (other than chapter 2, relating to tax on self- employment income) of the Code, but not less than the amounts allowable  under such section for the taxable year and prior years. This amount is  considered as the tax-benefit amount allowed and shall be determined in  accordance with paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.1016-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Life insurance companies. In the case of any evidence of  indebtedness referred to in section 818(b), the basis shall be adjusted  to the extent of the adjustments required under section 818(b) (or the  corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws) for the taxable year  and all prior taxable years. The basis of any such evidence of  indebtedness shall be reduced by the amount of the adjustment required  under section 818(b) (or the corresponding provision of prior income tax  laws) on account of amortizable premium and shall be increased by the  amount of the adjustment required under section 818(b) on account of  accruable discounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Stock and indebtedness of electing small business corporation.  In the case of a shareholder of an electing small business corporation,  as defined in section 1371(b), the basis of the shareholder's stock in  such corporation, and the basis of any indebtedness of such corporation  owing to the shareholder, shall be adjusted to the extent provided in  Sec. Sec. 1.1375-4, 1.1376-1, and 1.1376-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Gift tax paid on certain property acquired by gift. Basis shall  be adjusted by that amount of the gift tax paid in respect of property  acquired by gift which, under section 1015(d), is an increase in the  basis of such property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Section 38 property. In the case of property which is or has  been section 38 property (as defined in section 48(a)), the basis shall  be adjusted to the extent provided in section 48(g) and in section  203(a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1964.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Stock in controlled foreign corporations and other property.
