                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Full liability. An RDFI shall be liable to the Federal  Government for the total amount of all benefit payments received after  the death or legal incapacity of a recipient or the death of a  beneficiary unless the RDFI has the right to limit its liability under  Sec. 210.11 of this part. An RDFI shall return any benefit payments  received after the RDFI becomes aware of the death or legal incapacity  of a recipient or the death of a beneficiary, regardless of the manner  in which the RDFI discovers such information. If the RDFI learns of the  death or legal incapacity of a recipient or death of a beneficiary from  a source other than notice from the agency issuing payments to the  recipient, the RDFI shall immediately notify the agency of the death or  incapacity. The proper use of the R15 or R14 return reason code shall be  deemed to constitute such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of reclamation. Upon receipt of a notice of reclamation,  an RDFI shall provide the information required by the notice of  reclamation and return the amount specified in the notice of reclamation  in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception to liability rule. An RDFI shall not be liable for  post-death benefit payments sent to a recipient acting as a  representative payee or fiduciary on behalf of a beneficiary, if the  beneficiary was deceased at the time the authorization was executed and  the RDFI did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the death of  the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time limits. An agency that initiates a request for a  reclamation must do so within 120 calendar days after the date that the  agency first has actual or constructive knowledge of the death or legal  incapacity of a recipient or the death of a beneficiary. An agency may  not reclaim any post-death or post-incapacity payment made more than six  years prior to the date of the notice of reclamation; provided, however,  that if the account balance at the time the RDFI receives the notice of  reclamation exceeds the total amount of post-death or post-incapacity  payments made by the agency during such six-year period, this limitation  shall not apply and the RDFI shall be liable for the total amount of all  post-death or post-incapacity payments made, up to the amount in the  account at the time the RDFI receives the notice of reclamation and has  had a reasonable opportunity to act on the notice (not to exceed one  business day).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Debit of RDFI's account. If an RDFI does not return the full  amount of the outstanding total or any other amount for which the RDFI  is liable under this subpart in a timely manner, the Federal Government  will collect the amount outstanding by instructing the appropriate  Federal Reserve Bank to debit the account utilized by the RDFI. The  Federal Reserve Bank will provide advice of the debit to the RDFI.  [64 FR 17487, Apr. 9, 1999, as amended at 69 FR 13189, Mar. 19, 2004]</p>
