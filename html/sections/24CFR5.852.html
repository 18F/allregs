                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If the law and regulation permit you to take an action  but do not require action to be taken, you may take or not take the  action in accordance with your standards for admission and eviction.  Consistent with the application of your admission and eviction  standards, you may consider all of the circumstances relevant to a  particular admission or eviction case, such as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The seriousness of the offending action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effect on the community of denial or termination or the  failure of the responsible entity to take such action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending  action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The effect of denial of admission or termination of tenancy on  household members not involved in the offending action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to  lease responsibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal  responsibility and taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the  offending action; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The effect of the responsible entity's action on the integrity  of the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion of culpable household member. You may require an  applicant (or tenant) to exclude a household member in order to be  admitted to the housing program (or continue to reside in the assisted  unit), where that household member has participated in or been culpable  for action or failure to act that warrants denial (or termination).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consideration of rehabilitation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether to  deny admission or terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol  abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior,  you may consider whether such household member is participating in or  has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation  program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C.  13661). For this purpose, you may require the applicant or tenant to   submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or  successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation  program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If rehabilitation is not an element of the eligibility  determination (see Sec. 5.854(a)(1) for the case where it must be  considered), you may choose not to consider whether the person has been  rehabilitated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Length of period of mandatory prohibition on admission. If a  statute requires that you prohibit admission of persons for a prescribed  period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, you may apply  that prohibition for a longer period of time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Nondiscrimination limitation. Your admission and eviction  actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity  provisions of Sec. 5.105.</p>
