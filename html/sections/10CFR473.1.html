These regulations do not apply to subcontractors, or to contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, Department of Energy projects, or other agency projects entered into, made, or formally approved and initiated prior to February 25, 1978, or with respect to any renewal or extension thereof. Insofar as grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are concerned, these regulations provide procedures and requirements that are in addition to those generally applicable under the assistance and procurement regulations of the Federal agency funding research and development under the Act.</p>
