A launch operator must implement any unique safety policy, requirement, or practice needed to protect the public from the unique hazard. A launch operator must demonstrate through the licensing process that any unique safety policy, requirement, or practice ensures the safety of the public. For any change to a unique safety policy, requirement, or practice, with the exception of a launch specific update, the launch operator must file a request for license modification as required by Sec. 417.11. The FAA may identify and impose a unique safety policy, requirement, or practice as needed to protect the public.</p>
