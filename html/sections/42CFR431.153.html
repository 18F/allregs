                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Right to hearing. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, and subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (j) of  this section, the State must give the facility a full evidentiary  hearing for any of the actions specified in Sec.  431.151.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limit on grounds for appeal. The following are not subject to  appeal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The choice of sanction or remedy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State monitoring remedy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The level of noncompliance found by a State except when a  favorable final administrative review decision would affect the range of  civil money penalty amounts the State could collect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A State survey agency's decision as to when to conduct an  initial survey of a prospective provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of deficiencies and impending remedies. The State must  give the facility a written notice that includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis for the decision; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement of the deficiencies on which the decision was based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Request for hearing. The facility or its legal representative or  other authorized official must file written request for hearing within  60 days of receipt of the notice of adverse action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rules: Denial, termination or nonrenewal of provider  agreement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appeal by an ICF/IID. If an ICF/IID requests a hearing on  denial, termination, or nonrenewal of its provider agreement--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The evidentiary hearing must be completed either before, or  within 120 days after, the effective date of the adverse action; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the hearing is made available only after the effective date  of the action, the State must, before that date, offer the ICF/IID an  informal reconsideration that meets the requirements of Sec.  431.154.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appeal by an NF. If an NF requests a hearing on the denial or  termination of its provider agreement, the request does not delay the  adverse action and the hearing need not be completed before the  effective date of the action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special rules: Imposition of remedies. If a State imposes a  civil money penalty or other remedies on an NF, the following rules  apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basic rule. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this  section (and notwithstanding any provision of State law), the State must  impose all remedies timely on the NF, even if the NF requests a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. The State may not collect a civil money penalty until  after the 60-day period for request of hearing has elapsed or, if the NF  requests a hearing, until issuance of a final administrative decision  that supports imposition of the penalty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rules: Dually participating facilities. If an NF is also  participating or seeking to participate in Medicare as an SNF, and the  basis for the State's denial or termination of participation in Medicaid  is also a basis for denial or termination of participation in Medicare,  the State must advise the facility that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appeals procedures specified for Medicare facilities in part  498 of this chapter apply; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A final decision entered under the Medicare appeals procedures  is binding for both programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Special rules: Adverse action by CMS. If CMS finds that an NF is  not in substantial compliance and either terminates the NF's Medicaid  provider agreement or imposes alternative remedies on the NF (because  CMS's findings and proposed remedies prevail over those of the State in  accordance with Sec.  488.452 of this chapter), the NF is entitled only  to the appeals procedures set forth in part 498 of this chapter, instead  of the procedures specified in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Required elements of hearing. The hearing must include at least  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Opportunity for the facility--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To appear before an impartial decision-maker to refute the  finding of noncompliance on which the adverse action was based;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To be represented by counsel or other representative; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To be heard directly or through its representative, to call  witnesses, and to present documentary evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written decision by the impartial decision-maker, setting  forth the reasons for the decision and the evidence on which the  decision is based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Limits on scope of review: Civil money penalty cases. In civil  money penalty cases--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State's finding as to a NF's level of noncompliance must be  upheld unless it is clearly erroneous; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scope of review is as set forth in Sec.  488.438(e) of this  chapter.
