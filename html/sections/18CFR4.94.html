                            <p class="depth0">Any exemption granted under Sec. 4.93 for a small conduit  hydroelectric facility is subject to the following standard terms and  conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Article 1. The Commission reserves the right to conduct  investigations under sections 4(g), 306, 307, and 311 of the Federal  Power Act with respect to any acts, complaints, facts, conditions,  practices, or other matters related to the construction, operation, or  maintenance of the exempt facility. If any term or condition of the  exemption is violated, the Commission may revoke the exemption, issue a  suitable order   under section 4(g) of the Federal Power Act, or take appropriate action  for enforcement, forfeiture, or penalties under Part III of the Federal  Power Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Article 2. The construction, operation, and maintenance of the  exempt project must comply with any terms and conditions that the United  States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service,  and any state fish and wildlife agencies have determined are appropriate  to prevent loss of, or damage to, fish or wildlife resources or  otherwise to carry out the purposes of the Fish and Wildlife  Coordination Act, as specified in exhibit E of the application for  exemption from licensing or in the comments submitted in response to the  notice of exemption application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Article 3. The Commission may revoke this exemption if actual  construction of any proposed generating facilities has not begun within  two years or has not been completed within four years from the effective  date of this exemption. If an exemption is revoked under this article,  the Commission will not accept from the prior exemption holder a  subsequent application for exemption from licensing or a notice of  exemption from licensing for the same project within two years of the  revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Article 4. This exemption does not confer any right to use or  occupy any federal lands that may be necessary for the development or  operation of the project. Any right to use or occupy any federal lands  for those purposes must be obtained from the administering federal land  agencies. The Commission may accept a license application submitted by  any qualified license applicant and revoke this exemption, if any  necessary right to use or occupy federal lands for those purposes has  not been obtained within one year from the date on which this exemption  was granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Article 5. In order to best develop, conserve, and utilize in  the public interest the water resources of the region, the Commission  may require that the exempt facilities be modified in structure or  operation or may revoke this exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Article 6. The Commission may revoke this exemption if, in the  application process, material discrepancies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods  were made by or on behalf of the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Article 7. Before transferring any property interests in the  exempt project, the exemption holder must inform the transferee of the  terms and conditions of the exemption. Within 30 days of transferring  the property interests, the exemption holder must inform the Commission  of the identity and address of the transferee.
