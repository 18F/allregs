                            <p class="depth0">In determining the insurability of a credit union which makes  application for insurance and in continuing the insurability of its  accounts pursuant to title II of the Act, the following criteria shall  be applied:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reserves--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. State-chartered credit unions are  subject to section 216 of the Act, 12 U.S.C. 1790d, and to part 702 and  subpart L of part 747 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special reserve for nonconforming investments. State-chartered  credit unions (except state-chartered corporate credit unions) are  required to establish an additional special reserve for investments if  those credit unions are permitted by their respective state   laws to make investments beyond those authorized in the Act or the NCUA  Rules and Regulations. For purposes of this paragraph, if a state- chartered credit union conducts and documents an analysis that  reasonably concludes an investment is at least investment grade, as  defined in Sec. 703.2 of this chapter, and the investment is otherwise  permissible for Federal credit unions, that investment is not considered  to be beyond those authorized by the Act or the NCUA Rules and  Regulations. For any investment other than loans to members and  obligations or securities expressly authorized in title I of the Act and  part 703 of this chapter, as amended, state-chartered credit unions  (except state-chartered corporate credit unions) are required to  establish and maintain at the end of each accounting period and prior to  payment of any dividend, an Appropriation for Non-conforming Investments  in an amount at least equal to the net excess of book value over current  market value of the investments. If the market value cannot be  determined, an amount equal to the full book value will be established.  When at the end of any dividend period, the amount in the Appropriation  for Non-conforming Investments exceeds the difference between book value  and market value, the board of directors may authorize the transfer of  the excess to Undivided Earnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial condition and policies. The following factors are to  be considered in determining whether the credit union's financial  condition and policies are both safe and sound:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The existence of unfavorable trends which may include excessive  losses on loans (i.e., losses which exceed the regular reserve or its  equivalent [in the case of state-chartered credit unions] plus other  irrevocable reserves established as a contingency against losses on  loans), the presence of special reserve accounts used specifically for  charging off loan balances of deceased borrowers, and an expense ratio  so high that the required transfers to reserves create a net operating  loss for the period or that the net gain after these transfers is not  sufficient to permit the payment of a nominal dividend;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The existence of written lending policies, including adequate  documentation of secured loans and the protection of security interests  by recording, bond, insurance or other adequate means, adequate  determination of the financial capacity of borrowers and co-makers for  repayment of the loan, adequate determination of value of security on  loans to ascertain that said security is adequate to repay the loan in  the event of default, loan workout arrangements, and nonaccrual  standards that include the discontinuance of interest accrual on loans  past due by 90 days or more and requirements for returning such loans,  including member business loans, to accrual status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Investment policies which are within the provisions of  applicable law and regulations, i.e., the Act and part 703 of this  chapter for federal credit unions and the laws of the state in which the  credit union operates for state-chartered credit unions, except state- chartered corporate credit unions. State-chartered corporate credit  unions are permitted to make only those investments that are in  conformance with part 704 of this chapter and applicable state laws and  regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The presence of any account or security, the form of which has  not been approved by the Board, except for accounts authorized by state  law for state-chartered credit unions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The existence of a written interest rate risk policy (``IRR  policy'') and an effective interest rate risk management program  (``effective IRR program'') as part of asset liability management.  Federally insured credit unions (``FICUs'') with assets of more than $50  million, as measured by the most recent Call Report filing, must adopt a  written IRR policy and implement an effective IRR program. Appendix B to  this part 741 provides guidance on how to develop an IRR policy and an  effective IRR program. The guidance describes widely accepted best  practices in the management of interest rate risk for the benefit of all  FICUs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fitness of management. The officers, directors, and committee  members of the credit union must have conducted its operations in  accordance   with provisions of applicable law, regulations, its charter and bylaws.  No person shall serve as a director, officer, committee member, or  employee of an insured credit union who has been convicted of any  criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust, except with  the written consent of the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insurance of member accounts would not otherwise involve undue  risk to the NCUSIF. The credit union must maintain adequate fidelity  bond coverage as specified in Sec. 741.201. Any circumstances which may  be unique to the particular credit union concerned shall also be  considered in arriving at the determination of whether or not an undue  risk to the NCUSIF is or may be present. For purposes of this section,  the term ``undue risk to the NCUSIF'' is defined as a condition which  creates a probability of loss in excess of that normally found in a  credit union and which indicates a reasonably foreseeable probability of  the credit union becoming insolvent because of such condition, with a  resultant claim against the NCUSIF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Powers and purposes. The credit union must not perform services  other than those which are consistent with the promotion of thrift and  the creation of a source of credit for its members, except as otherwise  permitted by law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Letter of disapproval. A credit union whose application for  share insurance is disapproved shall receive a letter indicating the  reasons for such disapproval, a citation of the authority for such  disapproval, and suggested methods by which the applying credit union  may correct its deficiencies and thereby qualify for share insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Nothing in this section shall preclude the NCUA Board from  imposing additional terms or conditions pursuant to the insurance  agreement.
