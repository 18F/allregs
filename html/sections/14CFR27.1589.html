Appendix B to Part 27--Airworthiness Criteria for Helicopter</p><p class="depth0">Instrument Flight</p><p class="depth0">I. General. A normal category helicopter may not be type certificated for operation under the instrument flight rules (IFR) of this chapter unless it meets the design and installation requirements contained in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> VYI means instrument climb speed, utilized instead of VY for compliance with the climb requirements for instrument flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> VNEI means instrument flight never exceed speed, utilized instead of VNE for compliance with maximum limit speed requirements for instrument flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> VMINI means instrument flight minimum speed, utilized in complying with minimum limit speed requirements for instrument flight.</p><p class="depth0">III. Trim. It must be possible to trim the cyclic, collective, and directional control forces to zero at all approved IFR airspeeds, power settings, and configurations appropriate to the type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The helicopter must possess positive static longitudinal control force stability at critical combinations of weight and center of gravity at the conditions specified in paragraph IV (b) or (c) of this appendix, as appropriate. The stick force must vary with speed so that any substantial speed change results in a stick force clearly perceptible to the pilot. For single-pilot approval, the airspeed must return to within 10 percent of the trim speed when the control force is slowly released for each trim condition specified in paragraph IV(b) of the this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For single-pilot approval:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Climb.

Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 0.7 times the minimum recommended approach speed to 20 knots above the maximum recommended approach speed with--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The helicopter trimmed at the recommended approach speed or speeds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Power required to maintain a 3[deg] glide path and power required to maintain the steepest approach gradient for which approval is requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Helicopters approved for a minimum crew of two pilots must comply with the provisions of paragraphs IV(b)(2) and IV(b)(5) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Static directional stability must be positive throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed. In straight and steady sideslips up to 10[deg] from trim, directional control position must increase without discontinuity with the angle of sideslip, except for a small range of sideslip angles around trim. At greater angles up to the maximum sideslip angle appropriate to the type, increased directional control position must produce an increased angle of sideslip. It must be possible to maintain balanced flight without exceptional pilot skill or alertness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During sideslips up to 10[deg] from trim throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed, there must be no negative dihedral stability perceptible to the pilot through lateral control motion or force. Longitudinal cyclic movement with sideslip must not be excessive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For single-pilot approval--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp to \1/2\ amplitude in not more than one cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must damp to \1/2\ amplitude in not more than two cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less than 20 seconds must be damped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less than 6 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For helicopters approved with a minimum crew of two pilots--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp to \1/2\ amplitude in not more than two cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must be damped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Stability Augmentation System (SAS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If a SAS is used, the reliability of the SAS must be related to the effects of its failure. Any SAS failure condition that would prevent continued safe flight and landing must be extremely improbable. It must be shown that, for any failure condition of the SAS that is not shown to be extremely improbable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The helicopter is safely controllable when the failure or malfunction occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved IFR operating limitations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The overall flight characteristics of the helicopter allow for prolonged instrument flight without undue pilot effort.

If standby batteries are provided, they may be charged from the aircraft electrical system if adequate isolation is incorporated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Miscellaneous requirements.
