                                Sec. 5.26  Fiduciary powers of national banks and Federal savings
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 92a and 1462a, 1463, 1464(n), and 5412(b)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Licensing requirements. A national bank or Federal savings association must submit an application and obtain prior approval from, or in certain circumstances file a notice with, the OCC in order to exercise fiduciary powers. No approval or notice is required in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where two or more national banks consolidate or merge, and any of the national banks has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting national bank may exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the national bank to which approval was originally granted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where two or more Federal savings associations consolidate or merge, and any of the Federal savings associations has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received approval from the OCC or the Office of Thrift Supervision to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting Federal savings association may exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the Federal savings association to which approval was originally granted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where a national bank with prior OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers is the resulting bank in a merger or consolidation with a state bank, state savings association, or Federal savings association and the national bank will exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent to which approval was originally granted; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where a Federal savings association with prior approval from the OCC or the Office of Thrift Supervision to exercise fiduciary powers is the resulting savings association in a merger or consolidation with a state bank, state savings association, or national bank and the Federal savings association will exercise fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent to which approval was originally granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the procedures governing OCC review and approval of an application, and in certain cases the filing of a notice, by a national bank or Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers. Fiduciary activities of national banks are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part 9. Fiduciary activities of Federal savings associations are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part 150.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Policy. The exercise of fiduciary powers is primarily a management decision of the national bank or Federal savings association. The OCC generally permits a national bank or Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers if the bank or savings association is operating in a satisfactory manner, the proposed activities comply with applicable statutes and regulations, and the bank or savings association retains qualified fiduciary management.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedure--(1) In general. The following institutions must obtain approval from the OCC in order to exercise fiduciary powers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A national bank or Federal savings association without fiduciary powers:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A national bank without fiduciary powers that desires to exercise fiduciary powers as the resulting bank after merging with a state bank, state savings association, or Federal savings association with fiduciary powers or a Federal savings association without fiduciary powers that desires to exercise fiduciary powers as the resulting savings association after merging with a state bank, state savings association or national bank with fiduciary powers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A national bank that results from the conversion of a state bank or a state or Federal savings association that was exercising fiduciary powers prior to the conversion or a Federal savings association that results from a conversion of a state or national bank or a state savings association that was exercising fiduciary powers prior to the conversion; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A national bank or Federal savings association that has received approval from the OCC to exercise limited fiduciary powers that desires to exercise full fiduciary powers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association that desires to exercise fiduciary powers shall submit to the OCC

an application requesting approval. The application must contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A statement requesting full or limited powers (specifying which powers);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A statement that the capital and surplus of the national bank or Federal savings association is not less than the capital and surplus required by state law of state banks, trust companies, and other corporations exercising comparable fiduciary powers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sufficient biographical information on proposed trust management personnel to enable the OCC to assess their qualifications;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A description of the locations where the national bank or Federal savings association will conduct fiduciary activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If requested by the OCC, an opinion of counsel that the proposed activities do not violate applicable Federal or state law, including citations to applicable law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Any other information necessary to enable the OCC to sufficiently assess the factors described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If approval to exercise fiduciary powers is desired in connection with any other transaction subject to an application under this part, the applicant covered under paragraph (e)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(iii), or (e)(1)(iv) of this section may include a request for approval of fiduciary powers, including the information required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as part of its other application. The OCC does not require a separate application requesting approval to exercise fiduciary powers under these circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When reviewing any application filed under this section, the OCC considers factors such as the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The financial condition of the national bank or Federal savings association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The adequacy of the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital and surplus and whether it is sufficient under the circumstances and not less than the capital and surplus required by state law or state banks, trust companies, and other corporations exercising comparable fiduciary powers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The character and ability of proposed trust management, including qualifications, experience, and competency. The OCC must approve any trust management change the bank or savings association makes prior to commencing trust activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The adequacy of the proposed business plan, if applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The needs of the community to be served; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Any other factors or circumstances that the OCC considers proper.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Expedited review. An application by an eligible national bank or eligible Federal savings association to exercise fiduciary powers is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the application is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank or savings association prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review under Sec. 5.13(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Permit. Approval of an application under this section constitutes a permit under 12 U.S.C. 92a for national banks and 12 U.S.C. 1464(n) for Federal savings associations to conduct the fiduciary powers requested in the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice required. A national bank or Federal savings association that has ceased to conduct previously approved fiduciary powers for 18 consecutive months must provide the OCC with a notice describing the nature and manner of the activities proposed to be conducted and containing the information required by paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section 60 days prior to commencing any fiduciary activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notice of fiduciary activities in additional states. (i) No further application under this section is required when a national bank or Federal savings association with existing OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers plans to engage in any of the activities specified in Sec. 9.7(d) of this chapter or to conduct activities ancillary to its fiduciary business, in a state in addition to the state described in the application for fiduciary powers that the OCC has approved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unless the national bank or Federal savings association provides notice through other means (such as a merger

application), the national bank or Federal savings association shall provide written notice to the OCC no later than 10 days after it begins to engage in any of the activities specified in Sec. 9.7(d) of this chapter in a state in addition to the state described in the application for fiduciary powers that the OCC has approved. The written notice must identify the new state or states involved, identify the fiduciary activities to be conducted, and describe the extent to which the activities differ materially from the fiduciary activities the national bank or Federal savings association previously conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No notice is required if the national bank or Federal savings association is conducting only activities ancillary to its fiduciary business through a trust representative office or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability. Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of Sec. Sec. 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Expiration of approval. Approval expires if a national bank or Federal savings association does not commence fiduciary activities within 18 months from the date of approval, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.
