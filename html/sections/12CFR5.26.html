                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 92a.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensing requirements. A national bank must submit an  application and obtain prior approval from, or in certain circumstances  file a notice with, the OCC in order to exercise fiduciary powers. No  approval or notice is required in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where two or more national banks consolidate or merge, and any  of the banks has, prior to the consolidation or merger, received OCC  approval to exercise fiduciary powers and that approval is in force at  the time of the consolidation or merger, the resulting bank may exercise  fiduciary powers in the same manner and to the same extent as the  national bank to which approval was originally granted; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a national bank with prior OCC approval to exercise  fiduciary powers is the resulting bank in a merger or consolidation with  a state bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the procedures governing OCC  review and approval of an application, and in certain cases the filing  of a notice, by a national bank to exercise fiduciary powers. A national  bank's fiduciary activities are subject to the provisions of 12 CFR part  9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Policy. The exercise of fiduciary powers is primarily a  management decision of the national bank. The OCC generally permits a  national bank to exercise fiduciary powers if the bank is operating in a  satisfactory manner, the proposed activities comply with applicable  statutes and regulations, and the bank retains qualified fiduciary  management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedure--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The following institutions must obtain  approval from the OCC in order to offer fiduciary services to the  public:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A national bank without fiduciary powers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A national bank without fiduciary powers that desires to  exercise fiduciary powers after merging with a state bank or savings  association with fiduciary powers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A national bank that results from the conversion of a state  bank or a state or Federal savings association that was exercising  fiduciary powers prior to the conversion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of  this section, a national bank that desires to exercise fiduciary powers  shall submit to the OCC an application requesting approval. The  application must contain:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A statement requesting full or limited powers (specifying which  powers);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A statement that the capital and surplus of the national bank is  not less than the capital and surplus required by state law of state  banks, trust companies, and other corporations exercising comparable  fiduciary powers;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Sufficient biographical information on proposed trust management  personnel to enable the OCC to assess their qualifications;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A description of the locations where the bank will conduct  fiduciary activities; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> If requested by the OCC, an opinion of counsel that the proposed  activities do not violate applicable Federal or State law, including  citations to applicable law.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> or  (e)(1)(iii) of this section may include a request for approval of  fiduciary powers, including the information required by paragraph  (e)(2)(i) of this section, as part of its other application. The OCC  does not require a separate application requesting approval to exercise  fiduciary powers under these circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expedited review. An application by an eligible bank to exercise  fiduciary powers is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after  the application is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the bank  prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review  under Sec. 5.13(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Permit. Approval of an application under this section  constitutes a permit under 12 U.S.C. 92a to conduct the fiduciary powers  requested in the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notice of fiduciary activities in additional states. No further  application under this section is required when a national bank with  existing OCC approval to exercise fiduciary powers plans to engage in  any of the activities specified in Sec. 9.7(d) of this chapter or to  conduct activities ancillary to its fiduciary business, in a state in  addition to the state described in the application for fiduciary powers  that the OCC has approved. Instead, unless the bank provides notice  through other means (such as a merger application), the bank shall  provide written notice to the OCC no later than ten days after it begins  to engage in any of the activities specified in Sec. 9.7(d) of this  chapter in the new state. The written notice must identify the new state  or states involved, identify the fiduciary activities to be conducted,  and describe the extent to which the activities differ materially from  the fiduciary activities that the bank was previously authorized to  conduct. No notice is required if the bank is conducting only activities  ancillary to its fiduciary business through a trust representative  office or otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability. Sections 5.8,  5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC  concludes that an application presents significant and novel policy,  supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all  parts of Secs. 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Expiration of approval. Approval expires if a national bank does  not commence fiduciary activities within 18 months from the date of  approval.
