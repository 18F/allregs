If a mineral  deposit, or portion thereof, is not to be mined or is to be rendered  unminable by the operation, the operator/lessee shall submit appropriate  justification to the authorized officer for approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Appropriate maps and cross sections showing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Federal or Indian lease boundaries and serial numbers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Surface ownership and boundaries;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Locations of existing and abandoned mines;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Typical structure cross sections;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Location of shafts or mining entries, strip pits, waste dumps,  and surface facilities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Typical mining sequence, with appropriate timeframes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A narrative which addresses the environmental aspects associated  with the proposed mine which includes, at a minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An estimate of the quantity of water to be used and pollutants  that may enter any receiving waters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A design for the necessary impoundment, treatment or control of  all runoff water and drainage from workings to reduce soil erosion and  sedimentation and to prevent the pollution of receiving waters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control  fire, soil erosion, subsidence, pollution of surface and ground water,  pollution of air, damage to fish or wildlife or other natural resources  and hazards to public health and safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A reclamation schedule and the measures to be taken for surface  reclamation of the Federal or Indian lease(s). license(s), or permit(s)  that will ensure compliance with the established requirements. In those  instances in which the lease requires the revegetation of an area  affected by operations, the mining plan shall show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Proposed methods of preparation and fertilizing the soil prior  to replanting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Types and mixtures of shrubs, trees or tree seedlings, grasses  or legumes to be planted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Types and methods of planting, including the amount of grasses  or legumes per acre, or the number and spacing of trees or tree  seedlings, or combinations of grasses and trees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The method of abandonment of operations on Federal or Indian  lease(s), license(s), and permit(s) proposed to protect the unmined  recoverable reserves and other resources, inlcuding the method proposed  to fill in, fence or close all surface openings which are a hazard to  people or animals.
