                            <p class="depth0">An institution may elect to apply the cost-of-education/training  institutional allowance to a Fellow's tuition, fees and laboratory  expenses and to defray other program expenses (e.g., recruitment,  travel, publications, or salaries of project personnel), unless stated  otherwise in the solicitation. Tuition and fees are the responsibility  of the Fellow unless an institution elects to use its cost-of-education  institutional allowance for this purpose or elects to pay such costs out  of non-USDA monies. No dependency allowances are provided to any USDA  Graduate or Postdoctoral Fellows. Stipend payments and special  international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances  may be made to Fellows by the institution, in accordance with standard  institutional procedures for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships and  assistantships.</p>
