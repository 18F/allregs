                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Results of the engine tests shall be used to calculate  ventilation (cubic feet of air per minute) that shall be supplied by  positive air movement when the permissible mobile diesel-powered  transportation equipment is used underground. This quantity shall be  stamped on the approval plate. The quantity so determined shall apply  when only one machine is operated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of the ventilation rate shall be based upon  dilution of the exhaust gas with normal air. The most undesirable and  hazardous condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA shall be used  in the calculations. The concentration of any of the following  individual constituents in the diluted mixture shall not exceed:  0.25 percent, by volume, of carbon dioxide (CO2). 0.005 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide (CO). 0.00125 percent, by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as  equivalent nitrogen dioxide, NO2).   The oxygen (O2) content of the diluted mixture shall be not  less than 20 percent, by volume. The maximum quantity of normal air to  produce the above dilution shall be designated the ventilation rate.</p><p class="depth2">Note: This ventilation rate will provide a factor of safety for  exposure of persons to air mixtures containing harmful or objectionable  gases and for minor variations in engine performance.</p>
