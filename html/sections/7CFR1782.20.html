                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 1981, this section prescribes policies for debt  settlement of Water and Waste Disposal loans; Watershed loans and  advances; Resource Conservation and Development loans; and 306 (c) Water  and Waste Facility loans. Within the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions  and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134) is the Debt  Collection Improvement Act of 1996. This law provides that any non-tax  debt or claim owed to the United States that has been delinquent for a  period of 180 days shall be turned over to the Secretary of the Treasury  for appropriate action to collect or terminate collection actions on the  debt or claim. Debt that is in litigation or foreclosure, with a  collection agency or designated Federal debt collection center, or that  will be disposed of under an asset sales program, is exempt from  transfer to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements for debt settlement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debt or any  extension thereof on which settlement is requested must be due and  payable. The debt will be due and payable either under the terms of the  note or other instrument, or by acceleration, unless the debt is to be  cancelled without application under paragraph (e)(2) of this section or  charged off under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normally, all security will be disposed of prior to the date of  application for debt settlement unless it is necessary to abandon  security through the debt settlement process. In such cases, debt  settlement may proceed if the servicing official determines that further  collection efforts would be ineffective, uneconomical, and not in the  best interests of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Debtors will not be permitted to sell security and use the  proceeds as part or all of a compromise/adjustment debt settlement  offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for debt settlement will consist of Form RD 1956-1  ``Application For Settlement of Indebtedness,'' current financial  information, description and estimated market value of collateral, and  status of operation (i.e., number of users, compliance with  environmental issues, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Office of General Counsel (OGC) advice on compliance with State  or Federal statutes that may affect the debt settlement action must be  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Debts ineligible for settlement. Debts will not be settled if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Referral to the Office of Inspector General and/or to OGC is  contemplated or pending because of suspected criminal violation,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Civil action to protect the interest of the Government is  contemplated or pending,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An investigation for suspected fiscal irregularity is  contemplated or pending, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The debtor requests settlement of a claim that has been referred  to or a judgment obtained by the United States Attorney. The settlement  offer and any related payment must be submitted directly to the United  States Attorney for consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Types of debt settlement. Typically, debt settlement will be  accomplished through compromise/adjustment, charge-off, or cancellation.  Any debt remaining after the security has been liquidated, by sale or  transfer, will be cancelled if there are no other assets from which to  collect the debt. The servicing official will proceed with advice from  OGC and the National Office, as required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compromise and adjustment. Debts may be compromised or adjusted  and security retained by the debtor, provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor is unable to pay the indebtedness in full,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The debtor has offered an amount equal to the present fair  market value of all security or facility financed, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The debtor has offered any additional amount that the debtor is  able to pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cancellation. Non-judgment debts, regardless of the amount, may  be cancelled with or without application by the debtor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With application by the debtor. Debts may be cancelled upon  application of the debtor, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The servicing official furnishes a favorable recommendation  concerning the cancellation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is no known security for the debt and the debtor has no  other assets from which the debt could be collected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The debtor is unable to pay any part of the debt, and has no  reasonable prospect of being able to do so; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The debt or any extension thereof is due and payable under the  terms of the note or other instrument or due to acceleration by written  notice prior to the date of application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Without application by debtor. Debts may be cancelled upon a  favorable recommendation of the servicing official in the following  instances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Debtors discharged in bankruptcy. If there is no security for  the debt, debts discharged in bankruptcy shall be cancelled by the use  of Form RD 1956-1. A copy of the Bankruptcy Court's Discharge Order must  be attached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Impractical to obtain debtor's signature. Debts may be  cancelled if it is impractical to obtain a signed application and the  requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) of this section are met. Form RD 1956- 1 will document the specific reason(s) why it was impossible or  impracticable to obtain the signature of the debtor. If the debtor  refused to sign the application, the reason(s) should be documented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Charge-off--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Judgment debts. Judgment debts, regardless of  the amount, may be charged off without the debtor's signature upon a  favorable recommendation of the servicing official provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The United States Attorney's file is closed, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this section, if  applicable, have been met, or 2 years have elapsed since any collections  were made on the judgment. The debtor must also have no equity in the  property subject to the lien or upon which a lien can be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-judgment debts. Debts that cannot be settled under other  sections of this part may be charged off without the debtor's signature  upon a favorable recommendation of the servicing official in the  following instances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When OGC advises in writing that the claim is legally without  merit or that evidence necessary to prove the claim in court cannot be  provided; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When there is no known security for the debt, the debtor has no  other assets from which the debt could be collected, and the debtor:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is unable to pay any part of the debt and has no reasonable  prospect of being able to do so; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Is able to pay part or all of the debt but refuses to do so, and  OGC provides an opinion to the effect that the Government cannot enforce  collection   of a significant amount from assets or income.
