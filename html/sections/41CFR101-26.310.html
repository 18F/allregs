                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with the provisions of this Sec. 101-26.310, GSA may  authorize agencies to return for credit material that has been ordered  in error by the agency. Material shipped in error by GSA is subject to  the provisions of the GSA Handbook, Discrepancies or Deficiencies in GSA  or DOD Shipments, Material, or Billings (FPMR 101-26.8). Credit for  material ordered in error will be based on the selling price billed the  agency at the time shipment was made to the agency, with the adjustment  reflected in current or future billings. Material shall not be returned  until appropriate documentation is received from GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The return of material by an agency, to correct ordering errors,  may be authorized and later accepted by GSA: Provided,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The value of the material exceeds $25 per line item based on the  selling price billed the customer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorization to return is requested from the GSA Discrepancy  Reports Center (6FRB), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131  within 45 calendar days (60 calendar days for overseas points) after  receipt of shipment. Requests should always contain a complete  explanation of reason(s) for return of the material. Exceptions may be  granted on a case-by-case basis when GSA is in need of the material and  extenuating circumstances precluded earlier submission of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each item is in ``like-new'' condition and is identified by a  stock number in the current edition of the GSA Supply Catalog.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each item is identified with a specific purchase order or  requisition number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The condition of the material is acceptable on inspection by  GSA. When it is not acceptable, disposition, without credit, will be  made by GSA. However, when the condition is attributable to carrier  negligence, subsequent credit allowed by GSA will be reduced by the  amount to be paid the agency by the carrier for damages incurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The merchandise to be returned will not adversely affect the GSA  nationwide inventory situation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The return transportation costs are not excessive in relation to  the cost of the material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transportation costs on material specifically authorized for  return by a GSA regional office will be paid by the customer activity.  Claims against carriers for discrepancies in shipment will also be the  responsibility of the customer activity in accordance with the   provisions of subpart 101-40.7. When appropriate, GSA will prepare  initial documentation to support claim actions.
