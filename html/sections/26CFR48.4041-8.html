                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of the regulations in this subpart, unless otherwise  expressly indicated:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Highway. The term ``highway'' includes any road (whether a  Federal highway, State highway, city street, rural road, or otherwise)  in the United States which is not a private roadway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Highway vehicle--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``highway vehicle''  means   any self-propelled vehicle, or any trailer or semi-trailer, designed to  perform a function of transporting a load over highways, whether or not  also designed to perform other functions, but does not include a vehicle  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For purposes of this  definition, a vehicle consists of a chassis, or a chassis and a body if  the vehicle has a body, but does not include the vehicle's load.  Therefore, in determining whether a vehicle is a ``highway vehicle'', it  is immaterial that the vehicle is designed to perform a highway  transportation function for only a particular kind of load, such as  passengers, furnishings and personal effects (as in a house, office, or  utility trailer), a special type of cargo, goods, supplies, or  materials, or, except to the extent otherwise provided in paragraph  (b)(2)(i) of this section, machinery or equipment specially designed to  perform some off-highway task unrelated to highway transportation. In  the case of specially designed machinery or equipment, it is also  immaterial, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section,  that such machinery or equipment is permanently mounted on the vehicle.  For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term ``transport''  includes the term ``tow''. A vehicle which is not a highway vehicle  within the meaning of this paragraph shall be treated as a non-highway  vehicle for purposes of section 4041. Examples of vehicles that are  designed to perform a function of transporting a load over the public  highways are passenger automobiles, motorcycles, buses, and highway-type  trucks, truck tractors, trailers, and semi-trailers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certain specially designed mobile machinery for  nontransportation functions. A self-propelled vehicle, or trailer or  semi-trailer, is not a highway vehicle if it (A) consists of a chassis  to which there has been permanentaly mounted (by welding, bolting,  riveting, or other means) machinery or equipment to perform a  construction, manufacturing, processing, farming, mining, drilling,  timbering, or other operation similar to any one of the foregoing  enumerated operations if the operation of the machinery or equipment is  unrelated to transportation on or off the public highways, (B) the  chassis has been specially designed to serve only as a mobile carriage  and mount (and a power source, where applicable) for the particular  machinery or equipment involved, whether or not such machinery or  equipment is in operation, and (C) by reason of such special design,  such chassis could not, without substantial structural modification, be  used as a component of a vehicle designed to perform a function of  transporting any load other than that particular machinery or equipment  or similar machinery or equipment requiring such a specially designed  chassis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, where there is affixed to the vehicle  equipment used for loading, unloading, storing, vending, handling,  processing, preserving, or otherwise caring for a load transported by  the vehicle over the public highways, the functions are related to the  transportion of a load over the public highways even though the  functions may be performed off the public highways.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Certain trailers and semi-trailers specially designed to  perform nontransportation functions off the public highways. A trailer  or semi-trailer is not a   highway vehicle if it is specially designed to serve no purpose other  than providing an enclosed stationary shelter for the carrying on of a  function which is directly connected with and necessary to, and at the  off-highway site of, a construction, manufacturing, processing, mining,  drilling, farming, timbering, or other operation similar to any one of  the foregoing enumerated operations, such as a trailer specially  designed to serve as an office for such an operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Optional application. For purposes of section 4041, if any rules  existing immediately prior to January 13, 1977, would, if applicable,  unequivocally resolve an issue involving the definition of a highway  vehicle with respect to a period prior to such date, at the option of  the taxpayer, such rules existing prior to such date shall be applied to  resolve the issue for all periods prior to such date, and the rules of  paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section, which define the term  ``highway vehicle'', shall not apply with respect to such issue for all  periods prior to such date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Diesel-powered highway vehicle. The term ``diesel-powered  highway vehicle'' means any highway vehicle (within the meaning of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section) which is also a motor vehicle (as  defined in paragraph (c) of this section) and which uses diesel fuel (as  defined in paragraph (e) of this section) for propulsion purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motor vehicles. The term ``motor vehicle'' includes all types of  vehicles propelled by motor that are designed for carrying or towing  loads from one place to another, regardless of the type of load or  material carried or towed and whether or not the vehicle is registered  or required to be registered for highway use. Included are fork lift  trucks used to carry loads at railroad stations, industrial plants,  warehouses, etc. The term does not include farm tractors, trench  diggers, power shovels, bulldozers, road graders or rollers, and similar  equipment which does not carry or tow a load; nor does it include any  vehicle which moves exclusively on rails. For periods prior to January  6, 1977, a vehicle which is designed for towing, but not carrying, loads  shall not be considered to be a motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Taxable liquid fuel. The term ``taxable liquid fuel'' (or  ``taxable liquid'') means any liquid which is either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Diesel fuel as defined in paragraph (e) of this section,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special motor fuel as defined in paragraph (f) of this section,  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any liquid fuel used in an aircraft in ``noncommercial  aviation'', as defined in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Diesel fuel. The term ``diesel fuel'' means any liquid (other  than a product taxable as gasoline under the provisions of section 4081)  which is sold for use or used as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway  vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special motor fuel. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)  of this section, special motor fuel means any liquid fuel, including--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any liquefied petroleum gas (such as propane, butane, pentane,  or mixtures of the same);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Liquefied natural gas; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Benzol, benzene, naptha, or any other liquid, whether a  refined, partly refined, or unrefined product, 10 percent of which has  been recovered when the thermometer reads 347 [deg]F. (175 [deg]C.) or  95 percent of which has been recoverd when the thermometer reads 464  [deg]F. (240 [deg]C.) when subjected to distillation in accordance with  the ``Standard Method of Test for Distillation of Gasoline, Naptha,  Kerosene, and Similar Petroleum Products'' (A.S.T.M. designation: D86)  of the American Society for Testing Materials, regardless of the trade  name under which sold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term ``special motor fuel'' does not include any product  taxable under the provisions of section 4081, nor does it include  ``kerosene, gas oil, or fuel oil'', as defined in paragraph (g) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Kerosene, gas oil, or fuel oil. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``kerosene, gas,  oil or fuel oil'' means any product (i) 10 percent of which has not been  recovered when the thermometer reads 347 [deg]F. (175 [deg]C.), and (ii)  95 percent of which has not been recovered when the thermometer reads  464 [deg]F. (240 [deg]C.), when subjected to distillation in accordance  with the ``Standard Method of Test for Distillation of Gasoline, Naptha,  Kerosene, and Similar Petroleum Products''   (A.S.T.M. designation: D86) of the American Society for Testing  Materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Products designated as kerosene, gas, oil, or fuel oil which do  not fall within the specifications of both paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and  (ii) of this section are taxable as special motor fuel if sold or used  as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fuel used in the aircraft in noncommercial aviation. The term  ``fuel used in an aircraft in noncommercial aviation'' means any liquid  (including any product taxable under section 4081) that is sold for use  or used as a fuel in an aircraft in noncommercial aviation (as defined  in paragraph (j) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Registered. The term ``registered'', when used with reference to  a highway vehicle, means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Registered for highway use under the laws of any State, District  of Columbia, or foreign country, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Required to be registered for highway use under the law of the  State, District of Columbia, or foreign country in which it is operated  or situated. Any highway vehicle which is operated under a dealer's tag,  license, or permit is considered to be registered. A highway vehicle is  not considered to be ``registered'' solely because there has been issued  a special permit for operation of the vehicle at particular times and  under specified conditions. However, a highway vehicle which is required  to be registered and which also has been issued a special permit for  operation of the vehicle under specified conditions, such as carrying an  oversized load, is still considered to be ``registered''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Noncommercial aviation. The term ``noncommercial aviation''  means any use of an aircraft, other than in a business of transporting  persons or property for compensation or hire by air. The term also  includes any use of an aircraft, in a business described in the  preceding sentence, which is properly allocable to any transportation  exempt from taxes imposed by sections 4261 (transportation of persons)  and 4271 (transportation of property) by reason of section 4281 (use of  small aircraft on nonestablished lines) or 4282 (transportation of  members of affiliated group).
