                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> of the Act, the  administrator of any employee welfare benefit plan which covers fewer  than 100 participants at the beginning of the plan year and which meets  the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is exempted from  certain reporting and disclosure provisions of the Act. Specifically,  the administrator of such plan is not required to file with the  Secretary an annual or terminal report. In addition, the administrator  of a plan exempted under this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not required to furnish participants covered under the plan  and beneficiaries receiving benefits under the plan with statements of  the plan's assets and liabilities and receipts and disbursements and a  summary of the annual report required by section 104(b)(3) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not required to furnish upon written request of any  participant or beneficiary a copy of the annual report and any terminal  report, as required by section 104(b)(4) of the Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is not required to make copies of the annual report available  for examination by any participant or beneficiary in the principal  office of the administrator and such other places as may be necessary,  as required by section 104(b)(2) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. This exemption applies only to welfare benefit  plans--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which have fewer than 100 participants at the beginning of the  plan year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For which benefits are paid as needed solely from the general  assets of the employer or employee organization maintaining the plan, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The benefits of which are provided exclusively through  insurance contracts or policies issued by an insurance company or  similar organization which is qualified to do business in any State or  through a qualified health maintenance organization as defined in  section 1310(d) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  300e-9(d), the premiums for which are paid directly by the employer or  employee organization from its general assets or partly from its general  assets and partly from contributions by its employees or members,  Provided, That contributions by participants are forwarded by the  employer or employee organization within three months of receipt, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For which, in the case of an insured plan--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Refunds, to which contributing participants are entitled, are  returned to them within three months of receipt by the employer or  employee organization, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contributing participants are informed upon entry into the plan  of the provisions of the plan concerning the allocation of refunds; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Which are not subject to the Form M-1 requirements under  Sec. 2520.101-2 (Filing by Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements and  Certain Other Related Entities).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. This exemption does not exempt the administrator of  an employee benefit plan from any other requirement of title I of the  Act, including the provisions which require that plan administrators  furnish copies of the summary plan description to participants and  beneficiaries (section 104(b)(1)) and furnish certain documents to the  Secretary of Labor upon request (section 104(a)(6)), and which authorize  the Secretary of Labor to collect information and data from employee  benefit plans for research and analysis (section 513).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A welfare plan has 75 participants at the  beginning of the plan year and 105 participants at the end of the plan  year. Plan benefits are fully insured and premiums are paid directly to  the insurance company by the employer pursuant to an insurance contract  purchased with premium payments derived half from the general assets of  the employer and half from employee contributions (which the employer  forwards within three months of receipt). Refunds to the plan are paid  to participating employees within three months of receipt as provided in  the plan and as described to each participant upon entering the plan.  The plan appoints the employer as its plan administrator. The employer,  as plan administrator, provides summary plan   descriptions to participants and beneficiaries. He also makes copies of  certain plan documents available at the plan's principal office and such  other places as necessary to give participants reasonable access to  them. The exemption provided by Sec. 2520.104-20 applies even though the  plan has more than 100 participants by the end of the plan year, because  it had fewer than 100 participants at the beginning of the plan year and  otherwise satisfied the conditions of the exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A welfare plan is established and maintained in the same way as  the plan described in example (1), except that a trade association which  sponsors the plan is the holder of the insurance contract. Since the  plan still sends the premium payments directly to the insurance company,  the exemption applies, as in example (1).
