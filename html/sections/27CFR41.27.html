Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations set forth in the approval of the application. Failure to comply in good faith and with such procedures, conditions, and limitations

shall automatically terminate the authority for such variations and the importer thereupon shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variations may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where an importer desires to employ such variation, he shall submit a written application to do so, in triplicate, to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall describe the proposed variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be employed until the application has been approved. The importer shall retain, as part of his records, any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section.
