The owner or operator shall determine the VOC-content of the coatings  from formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by  an analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The  Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation  data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine the VOC  content of coatings using Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative  method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records the  volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings. If a  common coating distribution system serves more than one affected  facility or serves both affected and exiting facilities, the owner or  operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each facility by  using the average dry weight of coating, number of cans, and size of  cans being processed by each affected and existing facility or by other  procedures acceptable to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC  per volume of coating solids used during the calendar month for each  affected facility, except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this  section.
