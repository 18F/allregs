                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic oxygen process furnace (BOPF) means any furnace with a refractory lining in which molten steel is produced by charging scrap metal, molten iron, and flux materials or alloy additions into a vessel and introducing a high volume of oxygen-rich gas. Open hearth, blast, and reverberatory furnaces are not included in this definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Primary emissions means particulate matter emissions from the BOPF generated during the steel production cycle and captured by the BOPF primary control system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Primary oxygen blow means the period in the steel production cycle of a BOPF during which a high volume of oxygen-rich gas is introduced to the bath of molten iron by means of a lance inserted from the top of the vessel or through tuyeres in the bottom or through the bottom and sides of the vessel. This definition does not include any additional or secondary oxygen blows made after the primary blow or the introduction of nitrogen or other inert gas through tuyeres in the bottom or bottom and sides of the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Steel production cycle means the operations conducted within the BOPF steelmaking facility that are required to produce each batch of steel and includes the following operations: scrap charging, preheating (when used), hot metal charging, primary oxygen blowing, sampling (vessel turndown and turnup), additional oxygen blowing (when used), tapping, and deslagging. This definition applies to an affected facility constructed, modified, or reconstructed after January 20, 1983. For an affected facility constructed, modified, or reconstructed after June 11, 1973, but on or before January 20, 1983, steel production cycle means the operations conducted within the BOPF steelmaking facility that are required to produce each batch of steel and includes the following operations: scrap

charging, preheating (when used), hot metal charging, primary oxygen blowing, sampling (vessel turndown and turnup), additional oxygen blowing (when used), and tapping.
