Appendix to Part 972--Methodology of Comparing Cost of Public</p><p class="depth3">Housing With the Cost of Tenant-Based Assistance</p><p class="depth3">I. Public Housing-Net Present Value</p><p class="depth3">The costs used for public housing shall be those necessary to  produce a viable development for its projected useful life. The  estimated cost for the continued operation of the development as public  housing shall be calculated as the sum of total operating cost,  modernization cost, and costs to address accrual needs. Costs will be  calculated at the property level on an annual basis covering a period of  30 years (with options for 20 or 40 years). All costs expected to occur  in future years will be discounted, using an   OMB-specified real discount rate provided on the OMB Web site at http:// www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/Budget, for each year after the initial year. The  sum of the discounted values for each year (net present value) for  public housing will then be compared to the net present value of the  stream of costs associated with housing vouchers.</p><p class="depth3">Applicable information on discount rates may be found in Appendix C  of OMB Circular A-94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit Cost  Analysis of Federal Programs,'' which is updated annually, and may be  found on OMB's Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB. All cost  adjustments conducted pursuant to this cost methodology must be  performed using the real discount rates provided on the OMB Web site at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/Budget. HUD will also provide information  on current rates, along with guidance and instructions for completing  the cost comparisons on the HUD Homepage (http://www.hud.gov). The  Homepage will also include a downloadable spreadsheet calculator that  HUD has developed to assist PHAs in completing the assessments. The  spreadsheet calculator is designed to walk housing agencies through the  calculations and comparisons laid out in the appendix and allows housing  agencies to enter relevant data for their PHA and the development being  assessed. Results, including net present values, are generated based on  these housing agency data.</p><p class="depth3">A. Operating Costs</p><p class="depth3">1. Any proposed revitalization or modernization plan must indicate  how unusually high current operating expenses (e.g., security,  supportive services, maintenance, tenant, and PHA-paid utilities) will  be reduced as a result of post-revitalization changes in occupancy,  density and building configuration, income mix, and management. The plan  must make a realistic projection of overall operating costs per occupied  unit in the revitalized or modernized development, by relating those  operating costs to the expected occupancy rate, tenant composition,  physical configuration, and management structure of the revitalized or  modernized development. The projected costs should also address the  comparable costs of buildings or developments whose siting,  configuration, and tenant mix is similar to that of the revitalized or  modernized public housing development.</p><p class="depth3">2. The development's operating cost (including all overhead costs  pro-rated to the development--including a Payment in Lieu of Taxes  (P.I.L.O.T.) or some other comparable payment, and including utilities  and utility allowances) shall be expressed as total operating costs per  year. For example, if a development will have 375 units occupied by  households and will have $112,500 monthly non-utility costs (including  pro-rated overhead costs and appropriate P.I.L.O.T.) and $37,500 monthly  utility costs paid by the PHA, and $18,750 in monthly utility allowances  that are deducted from tenant rental payments to the PHA because tenants  paid some utility bills directly to the utility company, then the  development's monthly operating cost is $168,750 (or $450 per unit per  month) and its annual operating cost would be $5,400 ($450 times 12).  Operating costs are assumed to begin in the initial year of the 30-year  (or alternative period) calculation and will be incurred in each year  thereafter.</p><p class="depth3">3. In justifying the operating cost estimates as realistic, the plan  should link the cost estimates to its assumptions about the level and  rate of occupancy, the per-unit funding of modernization, any physical  reconfiguration that will result from modernization, any planned changes  in the surrounding neighborhood, and security costs. The plan should  also show whether developments or buildings in viable condition in  similar neighborhoods have achieved the income mix and occupancy rate  projected for the revitalized or modernized development. The plan should  also show how the operating costs of the similar developments or  buildings compare to the operating costs projected for the development.</p><p class="depth3">4. In addition to presenting evidence that the operating costs of  the revitalized or modernized development are plausible, when the  projected initial year per-unit operating cost of the renovated  development is lower than the current per unit cost by more than 10  percent, then the plan should detail how the revitalized development  will achieve this reduction in costs. To determine the extent to which  projected operating costs are lower than current operating costs, the  current per-unit operating costs of the development will be estimated as  follows:</p><p class="depth3">a. If the development has reliable operating costs and if the  overall vacancy rate is less than 20 percent, then the development-based  method will be used to determine projected costs. The current costs will  be divided by the sum of all occupied units and vacant units fully  funded under the Operating Fund Program plus 20 percent of all units not  fully funded under the Operating Fund Program. For instance, if the  total monthly operating costs of the current development are $168,750  and it has 325 occupied units and 50 vacant units not fully funded under  the Operating Fund Program (or a 13 percent overall vacancy rate), then  the $2,250,000 is divided by 335--325 plus 20 percent of 50--to give a  per unit figure of $504 per unit month. By this example, the current  costs per occupied unit are at least 10 percent higher (12 percent in  this example) than the projected costs per occupied unit of $450 for the  revitalized development, and the reduction in costs would have to be  detailed.</p><p class="depth3">b. If the development currently lacks reliable cost data or has a  vacancy rate of 20 percent or higher, then the PHA-wide method will be  used to determine projected costs. First, the current per unit cost of  the entire PHA will be computed, with total costs divided by the sum of  all occupied units and vacant units fully funded under the Operating  Fund Program plus 20 percent of all vacant units not fully funded under  the Operating Fund Program. For example, if the PHA's operating cost is  $18 million, and the PHA has 4,000 units, of which 3,875 are occupied  and 125 are vacant and not fully funded under the Operating Fund  Program, then the PHA's vacancy adjusted operating cost is $385 per unit  per month--$18,000,000 divided by the 3,825 (the sum of 3,800 occupied  units and 20 percent of 125 vacant units) divided by 12 months. Second,  this amount will be multiplied by the ratio of the bedroom adjustment  factor of the development to the bedroom adjustment factor of the PHA.  The bedroom adjustment factor, which is based on national rent averages  for units grouped by the number of bedrooms and which has been used by  HUD to adjust for costs of units when the number of bedrooms vary,  assigns to each unit the following factors: .70 for 0-bedroom units, .85  for 1-bedroom units, 1.0 for 2-bedroom units, 1.25 for 3-bedroom units,  1.40 for 4-bedroom units, 1.61 for 5-bedroom units, and 1.82 for 6 or  more bedroom units. The bedroom adjustment factor is the unit-weighted  average of the distribution. For instance, consider a development with  375 occupied units that had the following under an ACC contract: 200  two-bedroom units, 150 three-bedroom units, and 25 four-bedroom units.  In that example, the bedroom adjustment factor would be 1.127--200 times  1.0, plus 150 times 1.25, plus 25 times 1.4 with the sum divided by 375.  Where necessary, HUD field offices will arrange for assistance in the  calculation of the bedroom adjustment factors of the PHA and its  affected developments.</p><p class="depth3">c. As an example of estimating development operating costs from PHA- wide operating costs, suppose that the PHA had a total monthly operating  cost per unit of $385 and a bedroom adjustment factor of .928, and  suppose that the development had a bedroom adjustment factor of 1.127.  Then, the development's estimated current monthly operating cost per  occupied unit would be $467--or $385 times 1.214 (the ratio of 1.127 to  .928). By this example, the development's current operating costs of  $467 per unit per month are not more than 10 percent higher (3.8 percent  in this example) than the projected costs of $450 per unit per month and  no additional justification of the cost reduction would be required.</p><p class="depth3">B. Modernization</p><p class="depth3">Under both the required and voluntary conversion programs, PHAs  prepare modernization or capital repair estimates in accordance with the  physical needs of the specific properties proposed for conversion. There  are three key assumptions that guide how PHAs prepare modernization  estimates that affect remaining useful life and determine whether the  20-, 30-, or discretionary 40-year remaining useful life evaluation  period are used for the cost-test. When calculating public housing  revitalization costs for a property, PHAs will use a 30-year period if  the level of modernization addresses all accumulated backlog needs and  the planned redesign ensures long-term viability. For modernization  equivalent to new construction or when the renovations restore a  property to as-new physical conditions, a 40-year remaining useful life  test is used. When light or moderate rehabilitation that does not  address all accumulated backlog is undertaken, but it is compliant with  the International Existing Building Codes (ICC) or Public Housing  Modernization Standards in the absence of a local rehabilitation code,  the 20-year remaining useful life evaluation period must be used.</p><p class="depth3">Except for some voluntary conversion situations as explained in  paragraph E below, the cost of modernization is, at a minimum, the  initial revitalization cost to meet viability standards. In the absence  of a local code, PHAs may refer to the Public Housing Modernization  Standards Handbook (Handbook 7485.2) or the International Existing  Building Codes (ICC) 2003 Edition. To justify a 40-year amortization  cycle that increases the useful life period and time over which  modernization costs are amortized, PHAs must demonstrate that the  proposed modernization meets the applicable physical viability  standards, but must also cover accumulated backlog and redesign that  achieves as-new physical conditions to ensure long-term viability. To be  a plausible estimate, modernization costs shall be justified by a newly  created property-based needs assessment (a life-cycle physical needs  assessments prepared in accordance with a PHA's Capital Fund annual or  5-year action plan and shall be able to be reconciled with standardized  measures, such as components of the PHAs physical inspection and chronic  vacancy due to physical condition and design. Modernization costs may be  assumed to occur during years one through four, consistent with the  level of work proposed and the PHA's proposed modernization schedule.  For example, if the initial modernization outlay (excluding demolition  costs) to meet viability standards is $21,000,000 for 375 units, a PHA  might incur costs in three equal increments of $7,000,000 in years two,  three, and four (based on the PHA's phased modernization   plan). In comparing the net present value of public housing to voucher  costs for required conversion, a 30-year amortization period will  normally be used, except when revitalization would bring the property to  as-new condition and a 40-year amortization would be justified. On the  other hand, when the modernization falls short of meeting accumulated  backlog and long-term redesign needs, only a 20-year amortization period  might be justified.</p><p class="depth3">C. Accrual</p><p class="depth3">Accrual projections estimate the ongoing replacement repair needs  for public housing properties and building structures and systems  required to maintain the physical viability of a property throughout its  useful life as the lifecycle of building structures and systems expire.  The cost of accrual (i.e., replacement needs) will be estimated with an  algorithm that meets all ongoing capital needs based on systems that  have predictable lifecycles. The algorithm starts with the area index of  housing construction costs (HCC) that HUD publishes as a component of  its TDC index series. Subtracted from this HCC figure is half the  estimated modernization per unit, with a coefficient of .025 multiplied  by the result to provide an annual accrual figure per unit. For example,  suppose that the development after modernization will remain a walkup  structure containing 200 two-bedroom, 150 three-bedroom, and 25 four- bedroom occupied units, and if HUD's HCC limit for the area is $66,700  for two-bedroom walkup structures, $93,000 for three-bedroom walkup  structures, and $108,400 for four-bedroom walkup structures. Then the  unit-weighted HCC cost is $80,000 per unit and .75 of that figure is  $60,000 per unit. Then, if the per unit cost of the modernization is  $56,000, the estimated annual cost of accrual per occupied unit is  $1,300. This is the result of multiplying .025 times $52,000 (the  weighted HCC of $80,000) minus $28,000 (half the per-unit modernization  cost of $56,000). The first year of total accrual for the development is  $487,500 ($1,300 times 375 units) and should be assumed to begin in the  year after modernization is complete. Accrual--like operating cost--is  an annual expense and will occur in each year over the amortized period.  Because the method assumes full physical renewal each year, this accrual  method when combined with a modernization that meets past backlog and  redesign needs justifies a 30- or 40-year amortization period, because  the property is refreshed each year to as-new or almost as-new  condition.</p><p class="depth3">D. Residual Value (Voluntary Conversion Only)</p><p class="depth3">Under the voluntary conversion program, PHAs are required to prepare  market appraisals based on the ``as-is'' and post-rehabilitation  condition of properties, assuming the buildings are operated as public  or assisted, unassisted, or market-rate housing. Section 972.218  requires PHAs to describe the future use for a property proposed for  conversion and to describe the means and timetable to complete these  activities. HUD will permit a PHA to enter the appraised market value of  a property into the cost-test in Years 1 through 5 when a PHA  anticipates selling a property or receiving income generated from the  sale or lease of a property.</p><p class="depth3">As a separate line item to be added to total public costs as a  foregone opportunity cost, a PHA shall include in the voluntary cost- test calculations the appraised market or residual value (or net sales  proceeds) from the sale or lease of a property that is to be voluntarily  converted to tenant-based voucher assistance. The PHA must hire an  appraiser to estimate the market value of the property using the  comparable sale, tax-assessment, or revenue-based appraisal methods.  PHAs are advised to select one or more of these appraisal methods to  accurately determine the actual or potential market value of a property,  particularly the comparable sales or revenue-based methods. The market  or residual value is to be determined by calculating the estimated  market value for the property based on the appraisal, minus any costs  required for demolition and remediation. The residual value must be  incorporated into the cost-test instead of the actual market value only  when any demolition, site remediation, and clearance costs that are  necessary are covered by the selling PHA. However, if the sum of the  estimated per unit cost of demolition and remediation exceeds 10 percent  of the average Total Development Cost (TDC) for the units, the lower of  the PHA estimate or a figure based on 10 percent of TDC must be used.  Suppose the estimated remediation and demolition costs necessary for  conversion sale are $7,000 per unit. Also, suppose the TDC limits are  $115,000 for a two-bedroom unit, $161,000 for a three-bedroom unit, and  $184,000 for a four-bedroom unit. Then the average TDC of a development  with 200 two-bedroom units, 150 three-bedroom units, and 25 four-bedroom  units is $138,000 (200 times $115,000, plus 150 times $161,000, plus 25  times $184,000, the sum divided by 375) and 10 percent of TDC is  $13,800. In this example, the estimated $7,000 per unit costs for  demolition and remediation is less than 10 percent of TDC for the  development, and the PHA estimate of $7,000 is used. If estimated  expenses had exceeded 10 percent of TDC ($13,800 in this example),  demolition and remediation expenses must be capped at the lower amount.</p><p class="depth3">E. Accumulated Discounted Cost: Public Housing</p><p class="depth3">The overall cost for continuing to operate the development as public  housing is the sum of the discounted values of the yearly stream of  costs up for the amortization period, which can range from 20 to 30 to  40 years, depending on the extent of modernization relative to the  current physical and redesign needs of the development. In calculating  net present value for required conversion, the sum of all costs in each  future year is discounted back to the current year using the OMB- specified real discount rate. For voluntary conversion, the discount  rate is applied forward as a direct inflation factor. To assist PHAs in  completing the net present value comparison and to ensure consistency in  the calculations, HUD has developed a spreadsheet calculator that is  available for downloading from the HUD Internet site. Using PHA data and  property specific inputs (to be entered by the housing agency), the  spreadsheet will discount costs as described above and will generate net  present values for amortization periods of 20, 30, and 40 years.</p><p class="depth3">II. Tenant-Based Assistance</p><p class="depth3">The estimated cost of providing tenant-based assistance under  Section 8 for all households in occupancy shall be calculated as the  unit-weighted average of recent movers in the local area; plus the  administrative fee for providing such vouchers; plus $1,000 per unit (or  a higher amount allowed by HUD) for relocation assistance costs,  including counseling. However, if the sum of the estimated per unit cost  of demolition, remediation, and relocation exceeds 10 percent of the  average Total Development Cost (TDC) for the units, the lower of the PHA  estimate or a figure based on 10 percent of TDC must be used.</p><p class="depth3">For example, if the development has 200 occupied two-bedroom units,  150 occupied three-bedroom units, and 25 occupied four-bedroom units,  and if the monthly payment standard for voucher units occupied by recent  movers is $550 for two-bedroom units, $650 for three-bedroom units, and  $750 for four-bedroom units, the unit-weighted monthly payment standard  is $603.33. If the administrative fee comes to $46 per unit, then the  monthly per unit operating voucher costs are $649.33, which rounds to an  annual total of $2,922,000 for 375 occupied units of the same bedroom  size as those being demolished in public housing. To these operating  voucher costs, a first-year relocation is added on the voucher side. For  per-unit relocation costs of $1,000 per unit for relocation, then  $375,000 for 375 units is placed on the voucher cost side of the first  year.</p><p class="depth3">Accumulated Discounted Cost: Vouchers</p><p class="depth3">The overall cost for vouchers is the sum of the discounted values of  the yearly stream of costs up for the amortization period, which can  range from 20 to 30 to 40 years, depending on the extent of  modernization relative to the current physical and redesign needs of the  development. The amortization period chosen is the one that was  appropriate for discounting public housing costs. In calculating net  present value for required conversion, the sum of all costs in each  future year is discounted back to the current year using the OMB- specified real discount rate. For voluntary conversion, the discount  rate is applied forward as a direct inflation factor.</p><p class="depth3">To assist PHAs in completing the net present value comparison and to  ensure consistency in the calculations, HUD has developed a spreadsheet  calculator that will be available for downloading from the HUD Internet  site.</p><p class="depth3">III. Results of the Example</p><p class="depth3">With the hypothetical data used in the examples, under an  amortization period of 30 years, the discounted public housing costs  under required conversion sums to $69,633,225, and the discounted  voucher cost under required conversions totals $60,438,698. The ratio is  1.15, which means that public housing is 15 percent more costly than  vouchers. With this amortization and this data, the PHA would be  required to convert the development under the requirements of subpart A  of this part, except in a situation where a PHA can demonstrate a  distressed property that has failed the cost-test can be redeveloped by  meeting each of the four factors that compose the long-term physical  viability test to avoid removal from the inventory. With the same data,  but a 40-year amortization period, public housing is still 11 percent  costlier than vouchers, and with a 20-year amortization, public housing  is 25 percent costlier than vouchers. In voluntary conversion, with the  same hypothetical data, but a slightly different methodology (use of  residual value as a public housing cost, inflating forward the discount  numbers), the ratio of public housing costs to voucher costs would be  1.16 for the 20-year amortization period, 1.03 for the 30-year  amortization period, and .97 for the 20-year amortization period. Thus,  in voluntary conversion, the appropriate amortization period would  decide whether public housing is more costly or is slightly more costly,  or less than vouchers. Under a 20-year amortization assumption and  possibly under a 30-year amortization period, the PHA would have the  option of preparing a conversion plan for the development under subpart  B of this part. Different sets of data would yield different conclusions   for required and voluntary conversion determinations.  [71 FR 14336, Mar. 21, 2006]</p>
