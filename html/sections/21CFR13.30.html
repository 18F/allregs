                                Sec. 13.30  Proceedings of a Board.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of a Board is to review medical, scientific, and  technical issues fairly and expeditiously. The proceedings of a Board  are conducted as a scientific inquiry rather than a legal trial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Board may not hold its first hearing until after all  participants have submitted the information required by Sec. 13.25.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Chairman calls the first hearing of the Board. Notice of the  time and location of the first hearing is to be published at least 15  days in advance and the hearing will be open to the public. All  participants will have an opportunity at the first hearing to make an  oral presentation of the information and views which in their opinion  are pertinent to the resolution of the issues being considered by a  Board. A participant's presentation may be made by more than one person.  The Chairman determines the order of the presentation. Participants may  not interrupt a presentation, but members of the Board may ask  questions. At the conclusion of a presentation, each of the other  participants may briefly comment on the presentation and may request  that the Board conduct further questioning on specified matters. Members  of the Board may then ask further questions. Any other participant may  be permitted to ask questions if the Chairman determines that it will  help resolve the issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply.  No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information  and views may be made or considered, but other participants may comment  upon or rebut all such information and views. No participant may  interrupt the presentation of another participant for any reason.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within the time specified by the Board after its first hearing,  participants may submit written rebuttal information and views in  accordance with Sec. 13.20. The Chariman will then schedule a second  hearing, if requested and justified by a participant. A second hearing,  and any subsequent hearing, will be called only if the Chairman  concludes that it is needed to fully and fairly present information that  cannot otherwise adequately be considered and to properly resolve the  issues. Notice of the time and location of any hearing is to be  published at least 15 days in advance. The hearing is open to the  public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A Board may consult with any person who it concludes may have  information or views relevant to the issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The consultation may occur only at an announced hearing of a  Board. Participants have the right to suggest or, with the permission of  the Chairman, ask questions of the consultant and present rebuttal  information and views, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section except that written statements may be submitted to the Board  with the consent of all participants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A participant may submit a request that the Board consult with a  specific person who may have information or views relevant to the  issues. The request will state why the person   should be consulted and why the person's views cannot be furnished to  the Board by means other than having FDA arrange for the person's  appearance. The Board may, in its discretion, grant or deny the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All hearings are to be transcribed. All hearings are open to the  public, except that a hearing under Sec. 10.20(j)(3) is closed to all  persons except those persons making and participating in the  presentation and Federal Government executive branch employees and  special Government employees. At least a majority of Board members are  to be present at every hearing. The executive sessions of a Board,  during which a Board deliberates on the issues, are to be closed and are  not transcribed. All members of the Board shall vote on the report of  the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All legal questions are to be referred to the Chief counsel for  FDA for resolution. The Chief Counsel's advice on any matter of  procedure or legal authority is to be transmitted in writing and made a  part of the record or presented in open session and transcribed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> At the conclusion of all public hearings the Board will announce  that the record is closed to receiving information. The Board will  provide an opportunity for participants to submit written statements of  their positions, with proposed findings and conclusions, and may in its  discretion, provide an opportunity for participants to summarize their  positions orally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The Board will prepare a decision on all issues. The decision is  to include specific findings and references supporting and explaining  the Board's conclusions, and a detailed statement of the reasoning on  which the conclusions are based. Any member of the Board may file a  separate report stating additional or dissenting views.</p>
