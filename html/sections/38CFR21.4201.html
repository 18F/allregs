Otherwise the school should submit data sufficient to allow the Director, Education Service, to judge whether the school is similar to institutions which the Department of Education considers to be eligible to apply for a grant under these programs. The pertinent criteria and data categories are published in Title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter VI, part 624, subpart A; part 625, subpart A; and part 626, subpart A. The requirements of those criteria that a school be a ``public or nonprofit'' institution need not be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Previous compliance history of the school, including such factors as false or deceptive advertising complaints, enrollment certification timeliness and accuracy, and amount of school liability indebtedness to VA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> General effectiveness of the school's program in providing educational and employment opportunities to the particular veteran population it serves. Factors to be considered should include the percentage of veteran-students completing the entire

course, ratio of educational and general expenditures to full-time equivalency enrollment, etc.
