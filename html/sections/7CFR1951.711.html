                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When the conditions outlined in Sec. 1951.709(b) are met, the servicing options outlined in this section will be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Continuation on modified terms. When the recipient has the legal and financial capabilities, the case will be serviced according to one of the following, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unauthorized loan. A loan for the unauthorized amount determined according to Sec. 1951.707(a) will remain accelerated per the demand letter sent in accordance with Sec. 1951.708 unless modified terms are timely reached with the recipient and accrued at the interest rate specified in the outstanding debt instrument or at the present market interest rate, whichever is greater, for the respective Community and Business program area. The loan will be amortized per a repayment schedule satisfactory to Rural Development, but in no event may the revised repayment schedule exceed a period of fifteen (15) years, the remaining term of the original loan, or the remaining useful life of the facility, whichever is shorter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unauthorized grant. The unauthorized grant amount determined according to Sec. 1951.707(b) will be converted to an account receivable, with interest payable at the market interest rate for the respective Community Facilities or Business and Industry Program area in effect on the date the financial assistance was provided. In all cases, the receivable will be amortized per a repayment schedule satisfactory to Rural Development, but in no event may the amortization period exceed fifteen (15) years. The recipient will be required to execute a debt instrument to evidence this receivable, and the best security position available to adequately protect Rural Development's interest during the repayment period will be taken as security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unauthorized subsidy benefits received. When the recipient was eligible for the loan but should have been charged a higher interest rate than that in the debt instrument, which resulted in the receipt of unauthorized subsidy benefits, the case will be handled as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The recipient will be given the option to submit a written request that the interest rate be corrected to the lower of the rate for which they were eligible that was in effect at the date of loan approval or loan closing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any accrued unauthorized subsidy will be handled in accordance with Sec. 1951.709.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Continuation on existing terms. When the recipient does not have the legal and/or financial capabilities for the options outlined in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section, the recipient may be allowed to continue to meet the loan obligations outlined in the existing loan instruments. Rural Development will not continue with unauthorized grants on existing terms.
