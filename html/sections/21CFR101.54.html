                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a claim about the level of a nutrient in a food in relation to the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) established for that nutrient in Sec. 101.9(c)(8)(iv) or Daily Reference Value (DRV) established for that nutrient in Sec. 101.9(c)(9), (excluding total carbohydrates) may only be made on the label or in labeling of the food if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claim uses one of the terms defined in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in Sec. 101.13; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The food for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with Sec. 101.9, Sec. 101.10, or Sec. 101.36, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ``High'' claims. (1) The terms ``high,'' ``rich in,'' or ``excellent source of'' may be used on the label and in the labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in Sec. 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in Sec. 101.13(m), provided that the food contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms ``high,'' ``rich in,'' or ``excellent source of'' may be used on the label and in the labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in Sec. 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in Sec. 101.13(m), provided that the food contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be used on the label and in the labeling of meal products as defined in Sec. 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in Sec. 101.13(m), provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The product contains a food that meets the definition of ``high'' in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The label or labeling clearly identifies the food that is the subject of the claim (e.g., the serving of broccoli in this product is high in vitamin C).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ``Good Source'' claims.

A nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of antioxidant nutrients present in a food may be used on the label or in the labeling of that food when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An RDI has been established for each of the nutrients;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nutrients that are the subject of the claim have recognized antioxidant activity; that is, when there exists scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim is sufficient to qualify for the Sec. 101.54 (b), (c), or (e) claim (e.g., to bear the claim ''high in antioxidant vitamin C,'' the product must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C). Beta-carotene may be a subject of the claim when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears the claim is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, for the claim ``good source of antioxidant beta-carotene,'' 10 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per reference amount customarily consumed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim are included as part of the claim (e.g., ``high in antioxidant vitamins C and E''). Alternatively, when used as part of a nutrient content claim, the term ``antioxidant'' or ``antioxidants'' (as in ``high in antioxidants'') may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of a product label followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. The list of nutrients shall appear in letters of a type size height no smaller than the larger

of one-half of the type size of the largest nutrient content claim or \1/16\ inch.
