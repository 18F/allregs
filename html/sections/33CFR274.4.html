                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Administration. The Division Engineer is responsible for implementation of the program, and providing for the training of pest control personnel, safe use of highly toxic materials and the proper application of restricted-use pesticides. District programs will be reviewed by the Division Engineer for the selection of suitable pest control agents, up-to-date and economical methods of control, and the proper use and maintenance of pest control equipment. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) will designate a single point of contact for pesticide matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Personnel actions. Pesticide duties will be identified in applicable job descriptions whether they constitute a major duty or not. Such job descriptions will also note the employees responsibility for using personal protective equipment and clothing provided and for following established health and safety practices and procedures. Standard Form 78 medical examination will be augmented by the specific diagnostic tests for the occupations identified in Sec. 274.4(c). Prescribed preplacement medical examinations will be provided as part of the personnel action process before anyone is permitted to perform pesticide duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Medical surveillance. Preplacement, periodic and pretermination medical examinations of the type and extent set forth in Section III, U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency (USAEHA) ``Guide for the Medical Surveillance of Pest Controllers'' will be provided for personnel involved in pesticide operations. Additional information is contained in USAEHA ``Medical Surveillance Guide (Guide for Job-Related Examinations).'' Appropriate medical records will be maintained in official personal folders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Personnel training. All personnel directly involved in pest control must be properly trained in the safe application of herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides, fumigants and fungicides. The current plan for training and certification of pest control personnel requires that all pest control applicators and/or supervisors satisfactorily complete (1) the correspondence course, ``Basic Pest Control Technology'' NTTC 150, available from NAVFAC Technical Training Command, Norfolk, Virginia 23511 and a three day (20 hr) conference training course conducted by the Army Health Services Command (AHSC) at Fort Sam Houston, Texas 78234, for Civil Works personnel, or a three day (20 hr) special training course conducted by the Division Engineer, to include information presented in the ``Pesticide Applicator Training Manual'', Sec. 274.3(e) or (2) a B.S. degree in agronomy, entomology, forestry or horticulture from an accredited college or university.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Restricted-use pesticide training. For agency certification Sec. 274.3(f) Civil Works supervisors and applicators

using the higher toxicity Restricted-Use pesticides are required to complete Resticted-Use Pesticide training as given at Navy facilities at Jacksonville, Florida, or Alameda, California, Wichita Falls Air Base, or the Army Health Services Command, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. College and university programs which are acceptable for State certification of restricted-use pesticide applicators may be used in lieu of the above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Coordination with EPA. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to publish regulations listing pesticides classified for restricted-use by October 1977. The Division Engineer will be responsible for close coordination with EPA Regional Offices in order to comply with the regulatory requirements for restricted-use pesticides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exposure to and protection from pesticide hazards. Basic health and safety practices and procedures including personal protective equipment and clothing, work area layouts, storage and application considerations are identified in Appendix A of this regulation. Additional guidance is contained in Section II and Appendix A of the USAEHA ``Guide for Medical Surveillance of Pest Controllers.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Contracting for pest control services. All contracts for pest control services must receive Technical review and approval from professional pest control management personnel prior to advertisement of the contract and procurement of services. The contractor will be required to submit proof that his supervisory personnel to be employed on the contract are certified in the specific categories for operations being conducted in accordance with an approved state plan in effect in the area concerned.</p>
