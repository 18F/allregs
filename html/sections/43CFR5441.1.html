                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A bidder or purchaser for the sale of timber must be (1) an individual who is a citizen of the United States, (2) a partnership composed wholly of such citizens, (3) an unincorporated association composed wholly of such citizens, or (4) a corporation authorized to transact business in the States in which the timber is located. A bidder must also have submitted a deposit in advance, as required by Sec. 5441.1-1. To qualify for bidding to purchase set-aside timber, the bidder must not have been determined by the Small Business Administration to be ineligible for preferential award of set-aside sales and must accompany his deposit with a self-certification statement that he is qualified as a small business concern as defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR part 121).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At the request of the authorized officer, or the officer conducting the sale, bidders must furnish evidence of qualification in conformance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section or if such evidence has already been furnished, make appropriate reference to the record containing it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> A purchaser who is under review for debarment may continue to bid on timber purchase contracts until a final debarment determination has been made by the debarring official. However, contracts will not be awarded during the review period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A purchaser who is under review for debarment may continue to bid on timber purchase contracts until a final debarment determination has been made by the debarring official. However, contracts will not be awarded during the review period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Debarred purchasers are prohibited from bidding on timber purchase contracts.
[35 FR 9785, June 13, 1970, as amended at 47 FR 38696, Sept. 2, 1982; 52 FR 26983, July 17, 1987]


Sec. 5441.1-1  Bid deposits.</p><p class="depth3">Sealed bids shall be accompanied by a deposit of not less than 10 percent of the appraised value of the timber or other vegetative resources. For offerings at oral auction, bidders shall make a deposit of not less than 10 percent of the appraised value prior to the opening of the bidding. The authorized officer may, in his discretion, require larger deposits. Deposits may be in the form of cash, money orders, bank drafts, cashiers or certified checks made payable to the Bureau of Land Management, bid bonds of a corporate surety shown on the approved list of the United States Treasury Department or any guaranteed remittance approved by the authorized officer. Upon conclusion of the bidding, the bid deposits of all bidders, except the high bidder, will be returned. The deposit of the successful bidder will be applied on the purchase price at the time the contract is signed by the authorized officer unless the deposit is a corporate surety bid bond, in which case the surety bond will be returned to the purchaser.
[55 FR 22917, June 5, 1990]


Sec. 5441.1-2  Special considerations.</p><p class="depth3">Where a timber sale notice provides that the successful bidder may use a Small Business Administration road construction loan, and the bidder has reason to believe that he qualifies for such road construction loan under SBA regulations (13 CFR part 121), the bidder shall submit to the authorized officer a statement of his intention to file with SBA for such SBA road construction loan. The purpose of the filing is

to facilitate action by the authorized officer and the Small Business Administration on the loan application.
[35 FR 9785, June 13, 1970]


Sec. 5441.1-3  SBA set-aside sales.</p><p class="depth3">Only bids of small business concerns which have filed a self-certification statement as required by Sec. 5441.1 may be considered for sales subject to set-asides. When no such bids are received, the timber may be sold under Sec. 5443.1 in the same manner as timber not previously made subject to a set-aside. When timber subject to a set-aside is not sold for any other reason, the sale may be rescheduled for a set-aside sale.
