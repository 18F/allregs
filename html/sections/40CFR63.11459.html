                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in Sec. 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Air pollution control device (APCD) means any equipment that reduces the quantity of a pollutant that is emitted to the air.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous furnace means a glass manufacturing furnace that operates continuously except during periods of maintenance, malfunction, control device installation, reconstruction, or rebuilding.</p><p class="depth0">Cullet means recycled glass that is mixed with raw materials and charged to a glass melting furnace to produce glass. Cullet is not considered to be a raw material for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Electrostatic precipitator (ESP) means an APCD that removes PM from an exhaust gas stream by applying an electrical charge to particles in the gas stream and collecting the charged particles on plates carrying the opposite electrical charge.</p><p class="depth0">Fabric filter means an APCD used to capture PM by filtering a gas stream through filter media.</p><p class="depth0">Furnace stack means a conduit or conveyance through which emissions from the furnace melter are released to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Glass manufacturing metal HAP means an oxide or other compound of any of the following metals included in the list of urban HAP for the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy and for which Glass Manufacturing was listed as an area source category: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel.</p><p class="depth0">Glass melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory-lined vessel in which raw materials are charged and melted at high temperature to produce molten glass.</p><p class="depth0">Identical furnaces means two or more furnaces that are identical in design, including manufacturer, dimensions, production capacity, charging method, operating temperature, fuel type, burner configuration, and exhaust system configuration and design.</p><p class="depth0">Particulate matter (PM) means, for purposes of this subpart, emissions of PM that serve as a measure of filterable particulate emissions, as measured by Methods 5 or 17 (40 CFR part 60, appendices A-3 and A-6), and as a surrogate for glass manufacturing metal HAP compounds contained in the PM including, but not limited to, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and nickel.</p><p class="depth0">Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control, including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof.</p><p class="depth0">Raw material means minerals, such as silica sand, limestone, and dolomite; inorganic chemical compounds, such as soda ash (sodium carbonate), salt cake (sodium sulfate), and potash (potassium carbonate); metal oxides and other metal-based compounds, such as lead oxide, chromium oxide, and sodium antimonate; metal ores, such as chromite and pyrolusite; and other substances that are intentionally added to a glass manufacturing batch and melted in a glass melting furnace to produce glass. Metals that are naturally-occurring trace constituents or contaminants of other substances are not considered to be raw materials. Cullet and material that is recovered from a furnace control device for recycling into the glass formulation are not considered to be raw materials for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Research and development process unit means a process unit whose purpose is to conduct research and development for new processes and products and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale, except in a de minimis manner.</p>
