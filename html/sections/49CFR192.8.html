                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An operator must use API RP 80 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 192.7), to determine if an onshore pipeline (or part of a connected series of pipelines) is an onshore gathering line. The determination is subject to the limitations listed below. After making this determination, an operator must determine if the onshore gathering line is a regulated onshore gathering line under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream point in a production operation as defined in section 2.3 of API RP 80. This furthermost downstream point does not include equipment that can be used in either production or transportation, such as separators or dehydrators, unless that equipment is involved in the processes of ``production and preparation for transportation or delivery of hydrocarbon gas'' within the meaning of ``production operation.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(A) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the first downstream natural gas processing plant, unless the operator can demonstrate, using sound engineering principles, that gathering extends to a further downstream plant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(C) of API RP 80, is determined by the commingling of gas from separate production fields, the fields may not be more than 50 miles from each other, unless the Administrator finds a longer separation distance is justified in a particular case (see 49 CFR Sec. 190.9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(D) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream compressor used to increase gathering line pressure for delivery to another pipeline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of Sec. 192.9, ``regulated onshore gathering line'' means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each onshore gathering line (or segment of onshore gathering line) with a feature described in the second column that lies in an area described in the third column; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As applicable, additional lengths of line described in the fourth column to provide a safety buffer:
