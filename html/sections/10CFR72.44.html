The license conditions may be derived from the analyses and evaluations included in the Safety Analysis Report and amendments thereto submitted pursuant to Sec. 72.24. License conditions pertain to design, construction and operation. The Commission may also include additional license conditions as it finds appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each license issued under this part shall be subject to the following conditions, even if they are not explicitly stated therein;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Neither the license nor any right thereunder shall be transferred, assigned, or disposed of in any manner, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, through transfer of control of the license to any person, unless the Commission shall, after securing full information, find that the transfer is in accordance with the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and give its consent in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The license shall be subject to revocation, suspension, modification, or amendment in accordance with the procedures provided by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and Commission regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon request of the Commission, the licensee shall, at any time before expiration of the license, submit written statements, signed under oath or affirmation if appropriate, to enable the Commission to determine whether or not the license should be modified, suspended, or revoked.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The licensee shall have an NRC-approved program in effect that covers the training and certification of personnel that meets the requirements of subpart I before the licensee may receive spent fuel and/or reactor-related GTCC waste for storage at an ISFSI or the receipt of spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and/or reactor-related GTCC waste for storage at an MRS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The license shall permit the operation of the equipment and controls that are important to safety of the ISFSI or the MRS only by personnel whom the licensee has certified as being adequately trained to perform such operations, or by uncertified personnel who are under the direct visual supervision of a certified individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(i)</em> Each licensee shall notify the appropriate NRC Regional Administrator, in writing, immediately following the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition for bankruptcy under any Chapter of Title II (Bankruptcy) of the United States Code by or against:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each licensee shall notify the appropriate NRC Regional Administrator, in writing, immediately following the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition for bankruptcy under any Chapter of Title II (Bankruptcy) of the United States Code by or against:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The licensee;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An entity (as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(14)) controlling the licensee or listing the license or licensee as property of the estate; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An affiliate (as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(2)) of the licensee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This notification must indicate:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The bankruptcy court in which the petition for bankruptcy was filed; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date of the filing of the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each license issued under this part must include technical specifications. Technical specifications must include requirements in the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Functional and operating limits and monitoring instruments and limiting control settings. (i) Functional and operating limits for an ISFSI or MRS are limits on fuel or waste handling and storage conditions that are found to be necessary to protect the integrity of the stored fuel or waste container, to protect employees against occupational exposures and to guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Functional and operating limits for an ISFSI or MRS are limits on fuel or waste handling and storage conditions that are found to be necessary to protect the integrity of the stored fuel or waste container, to protect employees against occupational exposures and to guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring instruments and limiting control settings for an ISFSI or MRS are those related to fuel or waste handling and storage conditions having significant safety functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limiting conditions. Limiting conditions are the lowest functional capability or performance levels of equipment required for safe operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surveillance requirements. Surveillance requirements include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspection and monitoring of spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, or reactor-related GTCC waste in storage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspection, test and calibration activities to ensure that the necessary integrity of required systems and components is maintained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Confirmation that operation of the ISFSI or MRS is within the required functional and operating limits; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Confirmation that the limiting conditions required for safe storage are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Design features.
