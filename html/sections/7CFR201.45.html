                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The working sample on which the actual analysis is made shall be  taken from the submitted sample in such a manner that it will be  representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The sample shall be repeatedly divided to the weight to be used  for the working sample. Some form of efficient mechanical divider should  be used. To avoid damaging large seeds and coated seeds, a divider  should be used which will prevent the seeds from falling great distances  onto hard surfaces. In case the proper mechanical divider cannot be used  or is not available, the sample shall be thoroughly mixed and placed in  a pile and the pile shall be repeatedly divided into halves until a  sample of the desired weight remains.
