You must comply with the requirements of this part unless and until we grant an exemption for your device. Your request for exemption must explain why you believe we should exempt the device or model from postmarket surveillance. You should demonstrate why the surveillance question does not apply to your device or does not need to be answered for the device for which you are requesting exemption. Alternatively, you may provide information that answers the surveillance question for your device, with supporting documentation, to the address in Sec. 822.8.</p>
