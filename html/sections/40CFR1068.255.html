                                Sec.  1068.255  What are the provisions for exempting engines and and secondary engine  manufacturers?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how, in unusual circumstances, we may approve  an exemption to prevent hardship to an equipment manufacturer or a  secondary engine manufacturer. This section does not apply to products  that are subject to equipment-based exhaust emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> if  you manufacture the engine or fuel-system components you need for your  own equipment, or if complying engines or fuel-system components are  available from other manufacturers that could be used in your equipment,  unless we allow it elsewhere in this chapter. We may impose other  conditions, including provisions to use products meeting less stringent  emission standards or to recover the lost environmental benefit. In  determining whether to grant the exemptions, we will consider all  relevant factors, including the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of engines or fuel-system components involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The size of your company and your ability to endure the  hardship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of time you had to redesign your equipment to  accommodate complying products.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether there was any breach of contract by a supplier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The potential for market disruption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Engine and fuel-system component exemption. As an engine  manufacturer   or fuel-system component manufacturer, you may produce nonconforming  products for the equipment we exempt in paragraph (a) of this section.  You do not have to request this exemption but you must have written  assurance from equipment manufacturers that they need a certain number  of exempted products under this section. Label engines or fuel-system  components as follows, consistent with Sec.  1068.45:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines. Add a permanent label to all engines/equipment exempted  under this section with at least the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The label heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Engine displacement (in liters or cubic centimeters) and model  year of the engine, or whom to contact for further information. We may  also require that you include maximum engine power.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the engine does not meet any emission standards: ``THIS  ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1068.255 FROM EMISSION STANDARDS AND  RELATED REQUIREMENTS.'' If the engine meets alternate emission standards  as a condition of an exemption under this section, we may specify a  different statement to identify the alternate emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel-system components. Add a permanent label to all engines/ equipment exempted under this section with at least the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The statement ``EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 1068.255''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Secondary engine manufacturers. As a secondary engine  manufacturer, you may ask for approval to produce exempted engines under  this section for up to 12 months. We may require you to certify your  engines to compliance levels above the emission standards that apply.  For example, in the case of multiple tiers of emission standards, we may  require you to meet the standards from the previous tier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions in paragraph (a) of this section that apply to  equipment manufacturers requesting an exemption apply equally to you  except that you may manufacture the engines. Before we approve an  exemption under this section, we will generally require that you commit  to a plan to make up the lost environmental benefit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you produce uncertified engines under this exemption, we will  calculate the lost environmental benefit based on our best estimate of  uncontrolled emission rates for your engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you produce engines under this exemption that are certified  to a compliance level less stringent than the emission standards that  would otherwise apply, we will calculate the lost environmental benefit  based on the compliance level you select for your engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The labeling requirements in paragraph (b) of this section apply  to your exempted engines; however, if you certify engines to specific  compliance levels, state on the label the compliance levels that apply  to each engine.</p>
