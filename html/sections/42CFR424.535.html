                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reasons for revocation. CMS may revoke a currently enrolled  provider or supplier's Medicare billing privileges and any corresponding  provider agreement or supplier agreement for the following reasons:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Noncompliance. The provider or supplier is determined to not be  in compliance with the enrollment requirements described in this subpart  P or in the enrollment application applicable for its provider or  supplier type, and has not submitted a plan of corrective action as  outlined in part 488 of this chapter. The provider or supplier may also  be determined not to be in compliance if it has failed to pay any user  fees as assessed under part 488 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CMS may request additional documentation from the provider or  supplier to determine compliance if adverse information is received or  otherwise found concerning the provider or supplier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requested additional documentation must be submitted within 60  calendar days of request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provider or supplier conduct. The provider or supplier, or any  owner, managing employee, authorized or delegated official, medical  director, supervising physician, or other health care personnel of the  provider or supplier is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid, and any other Federal  health care program, as defined in Sec. 1001.2 of this chapter, in  accordance with section 1128, 1128A, 1156, 1842, 1862, 1867 or 1892 of  the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from  participating in any other Federal procurement or nonprocurement program  or activity in accordance with the FASA implementing regulations and the  Department of Health and Human Services nonprocurement common rule at 45  CFR part 76.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Felonies. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The provider, supplier, or any owner or managing  employee of the provider or supplier was, within the preceding 10 years,  convicted (as that term is defined in 42 CFR 1001.2) of a Federal or  State felony offense that CMS determines is detrimental to the best  interests of the Medicare program and its beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Offenses include, but are not limited in scope or severity to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Felony crimes against persons, such as murder, rape, assault,  and other similar crimes for which the individual was convicted,  including guilty pleas and adjudicated pretrial diversions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Financial crimes, such as extortion, embezzlement, income tax  evasion, insurance fraud and other similar crimes for which the  individual was convicted, including guilty pleas and adjudicated  pretrial diversions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any felony that placed the Medicare program or its beneficiaries  at immediate risk, such as a malpractice suit that results in a  conviction of criminal neglect or misconduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any felonies that would result in mandatory exclusion under  section 1128(a) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Revocations based on felony convictions are for a period to be  determined by the Secretary, but not less   than 10 years from the date of conviction if the individual has been  convicted on one previous occasion for one or more offenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> False or misleading information. The provider or supplier  certified as ``true'' misleading or false information on the enrollment  application to be enrolled or maintain enrollment in the Medicare  program. (Offenders may be subject to either fines or imprisonment, or  both, in accordance with current law and regulations.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> On-site review. Upon on-site review or other reliable evidence,  CMS determines that the provider or supplier is either of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No longer operational to furnish Medicare-covered items or  services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Otherwise fails to satisfy any Medicare enrollment requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Grounds related to provider and supplier screening requirements.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An institutional provider does not submit an application fee or  hardship exception request that meets the requirements set forth in  Sec. 424.514 with the Medicare revalidation application; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The hardship exception is not granted and the institutional  provider does not submit the applicable application form or application  fee within 30 days of being notified that the hardship exception request  was denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Either of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CMS is not able to deposit the full application amount into a  government-owned account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The funds are not able to be credited to the U.S. Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The provider or supplier lacks sufficient funds in the account  at the banking institution whose name is imprinted on the check or other  banking instrument to pay the application fee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> There is any other reason why CMS or its Medicare contractor is  unable to deposit the application fee into a government-owned account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Misuse of billing number. The provider or supplier knowingly  sells to or allows another individual or entity to use its billing  number. This does not include those providers or suppliers who enter  into a valid reassignment of benefits as specified in Sec. 424.80 or a  change of ownership as outlined in Sec. 489.18 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Abuse of billing privileges. Abuse of billing privileges  includes either of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The provider or supplier submits a claim or claims for services  that could not have been furnished to a specific individual on the date  of service. These instances include but are not limited to the following  situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Where the beneficiary is deceased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The directing physician or beneficiary is not in the state or  country when services were furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When the equipment necessary for testing is not present where  the testing is said to have occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CMS determines that the provider or supplier has a pattern or  practice of submitting claims that fail to meet Medicare requirements.  In making this determination, CMS considers, as appropriate or  applicable, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The percentage of submitted claims that were denied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The reason(s) for the claim denials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Whether the provider or supplier has any history of final  adverse actions (as that term is defined under Sec. 424.502) and the  nature of any such actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The length of time over which the pattern has continued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> How long the provider or supplier has been enrolled in Medicare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Any other information regarding the provider or supplier's  specific circumstances that CMS deems relevant to its determination as  to whether the provider or supplier has or has not engaged in the  pattern or practice described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Failure to report. The provider or supplier did not comply with  the reporting requirements specified in Sec. 424.516(d)(1)(ii) and (iii)  of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Failure to document or provide CMS access to documentation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  The provider or supplier did not comply with the documentation or CMS  access requirements specified in Sec. 424.516(f) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A provider or supplier that meets the revocation criteria  specified in paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section, is subject to  revocation for a period of   not more than 1 year for each act of noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Initial reserve operating funds. CMS or its designated Medicare  contractor may revoke the Medicare billing privileges of an HHA and the  corresponding provider agreement if, within 30 days of a CMS or Medicare  contractor request, the HHA cannot furnish supporting documentation  verifying that the HHA meets the initial reserve operating funds  requirement found in 42 CFR 489.28(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Medicaid termination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medicaid billing privileges are  terminated or revoked by a State Medicaid Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Medicare may not terminate unless and until a provider or  supplier has exhausted all applicable appeal rights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Prescribing authority. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The physician or eligible  professional's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Certificate of  Registration is suspended or revoked; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable licensing or administrative body for any state  in which the physician or eligible professional practices suspends or  revokes the physician or eligible professional's ability to prescribe  drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Improper prescribing practices. CMS determines that the  physician or eligible professional has a pattern or practice of  prescribing Part D drugs that falls into one of the following  categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The pattern or practice is abusive or represents a threat to the  health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries or both. In making this  determination, CMS considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether there are diagnoses to support the indications for which  the drugs were prescribed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether there are instances when the necessary evaluation of the  patient for whom the drug was prescribed could not have occurred (for  example, the patient was deceased or out of state at the time of the  alleged office visit).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Whether the physician or eligible professional has prescribed  controlled substances in excessive dosages that are linked to patient  overdoses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The number and type(s) of disciplinary actions taken against the  physician or eligible professional by the licensing body or medical  board for the State or States in which he or she practices, and the  reason(s) for the action(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Whether the physician or eligible professional has any history  of ``final adverse actions'' (as that term is defined in Sec. 424.502).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The number and type(s) of malpractice suits that have been filed  against the physician or eligible professional related to prescribing  that have resulted in a final judgment against the physician or eligible  professional or in which the physician or eligible professional has paid  a settlement to the plaintiff(s) (to the extent this can be determined).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Whether any State Medicaid program or any other public or  private health insurance program has restricted, suspended, revoked, or  terminated the physician or eligible professional's ability to prescribe  medications, and the reason(s) for any such restriction, suspension,  revocation, or termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Any other relevant information provided to CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The pattern or practice of prescribing fails to meet Medicare  requirements. In making this determination, CMS considers the following  factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the physician or eligible professional has a pattern or  practice of prescribing without valid prescribing authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether the physician or eligible professional has a pattern or  practice of prescribing for controlled substances outside the scope of  the prescriber's DEA registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Whether the physician or eligible professional has a pattern or  practice of prescribing drugs for indications that were not medically  accepted--that is, for indications neither approved by the FDA nor  medically accepted under section 1860D-2(e)(4) of the Act--and whether  there is evidence that the physician or eligible professional acted in  reckless disregard for the health and safety of the patient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect of revocation on provider agreements. When a provider's  or supplier's billing privilege is revoked, any provider agreement in  effect at the time of revocation is terminated effective with the date  of revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reapplying after revocation. If a provider, supplier, owner, or  managing   employee has their billing privileges revoked, they are barred from  participating in the Medicare program from the date of the revocation  until the end of the re-enrollment bar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The re-enrollment bar begins 30 days after CMS or its contractor  mails notice of the revocation and lasts a minimum of 1 year, but not  greater than 3 years, depending on the severity of the basis for  revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The re-enrollment bar does not apply in the event a revocation  of Medicare billing privileges is imposed under paragraph (a)(1) of this  section based upon a provider or supplier's failure to respond timely to  a revalidation request or other request for information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Re-enrollment after revocation. If a provider or supplier seeks  to re-establish enrollment in the Medicare program after notification  that its billing privileges is revoked (either after the appeals process  is exhausted or in place of the appeals process), the following  conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provider or supplier must re-enroll in the Medicare program  through the completion and submission of a new applicable enrollment  application and applicable documentation, as a new provider or supplier,  for validation by CMS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Providers must be resurveyed and recertified by the State survey  agency as a new provider and must establish a new provider agreement  with CMS's Regional Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reversal of revocation. If the revocation was due to adverse  activity (sanction, exclusion, or felony) against an owner, managing  employee, or an authorized or delegated official; or a medical director,  supervising physician, or other personnel of the provider or supplier  furnishing Medicare reimbursable services, the revocation may be  reversed if the provider or supplier terminates and submits proof that  it has terminated its business relationship with that individual within  30 days of the revocation notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Additional review. When a provider or supplier is revoked from  the Medicare program, CMS automatically reviews all other related  Medicare enrollment files that the revoked provider or supplier has an  association with (for example, as an owner or managing employee) to  determine if the revocation warrants an adverse action of the associated  Medicare provider or supplier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date of revocation. Revocation becomes effective 30  days after CMS or the CMS contractor mails notice of its determination  to the provider or supplier, except if the revocation is based on  Federal exclusion or debarment, felony conviction, license suspension or  revocation, or the practice location is determined by CMS or its  contractor not to be operational. When a revocation is based on a  Federal exclusion or debarment, felony conviction, license suspension or  revocation, or the practice location is determined by CMS or its  contractor not to be operational, the revocation is effective with the  date of exclusion or debarment, felony conviction, license suspension or  revocation or the date that CMS or its contractor determined that the  provider or supplier was no longer operational.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Submission of claims for services furnished before revocation.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except for HHAs as described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this  section, a revoked provider or supplier must, within 60 calendar days  after the effective date of revocation, submit all claims for items and  services furnished before the date of the revocation letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A revoked HHA must submit all claims for items and services  within 60 days after the later of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The effective date of the revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date that the HHA's last payable episode ends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this paragraph (h) impacts the requirements of  Sec. 424.44 regarding the timely filing of claims.
