                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except in the case of fraudulent noncompliance, no claim for drawback shall be denied for a failure to comply with either 26 U.S.C. 5111-5114 or the requirements of this part, if the claimant establishes that spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined were in fact used in the manufacture of medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume, which were unfit for beverage purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Penalty. Noncompliance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5111-5114 or of this part subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each separate product, reflected in a claim for drawback, to which the noncompliance relates, or the amount claimed for that product, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the noncompliance was due to reasonable cause. Late filing of a claim subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 or the amount of the claim, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the lateness was due to reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reasonable cause. Reasonable cause exists where a claimant establishes it exercised ordinary business care and prudence, and still was unable to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements. Ignorance of law or regulations, in and of itself, is not reasonable cause. Each case is individually evaluated.
