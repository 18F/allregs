                            <p class="depth0">The guidelines in this subpart specify the factors to be considered in evaluating and comparing sites on the basis of expected repository performance before closure. The preclosure guidelines are separated into three system guidelines and eleven technical guidelines.


Sec. 960.5-1  System guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Qualifying conditions--(1) Preclosure radiological safety. Any projected radiological exposures of the general public and any projected releases of radioactive materials to restricted and unrestricted areas during repository operation and closure shall meet the applicable safety requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 20, 10 CFR part 60, and 40 CFR 191, subpart A (see appendix II of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Environment, socioeconomics, and transportation. During repository siting, construction, operation, closure, and decommissioning the public and the environment shall be adequately protected from the hazards posed by the disposal of radioactive waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ease and cost of siting, construction, operation, and closure. Repository siting, construction, operation, and closure shall be demonstrated to be technically feasible on the basis of reasonably available technology, and the associated costs shall be demonstrated to be reasonable relative to other available and comparable siting options.


Sec. 960.5-2  Technical guidelines.</p><p class="depth0">The technical guidelines in this subpart set forth qualifying, favorable, potentially adverse, and, in seven guidelines, disqualifying conditions for the characteristics, processes, and events that influence the suitability of a site relative to the preclosure system guidelines. These conditions are separated into three main groups: Preclosure radiological safety; environment, socioeconomics, and transportation; and ease and cost of siting, construction, operation, and closure. The first group includes conditions on population density and distribution, site ownership and control, meteorology, and offsite installations and operations. The second group includes conditions related to environmental quality and socioeconomic impacts in areas potentially affected by a repository and to the transportation of waste to a repository site. The third group includes conditions on the surface characteristics of the site, the characteristics of the host rock and surrounding strata, hydrology, and tectonics. The individual technical guidelines within each group, as well as the favorable conditions and the potentially adverse conditions under each guideline, are not listed in any assumed order of importance. The technical guidelines that follow establish conditions that shall be considered in determining compliance with the qualifying conditions of the preclosure system guidelines. For

each technical guideline, an evaluation of qualification or disqualification shall be made in accordance with the requirements specified in subpart B.</p><p class="depth0">Preclosure Radiological Safety

Appendix I to Part 960--NRC and EPA Requirements for Postclosure</p><p class="depth0">Repository Performance</p><p class="depth0">Under proposed 40 CFR part 191, subpart B--Environmental Standards for Disposal, Sec. 191.13, ``Containment Requirements'', specifies that for 10,000 years after disposal (a) releases of radioactive materials to the accessible environment that are estimated to have more than one chance in 100 of occurring over a 10,000 year period (``reasonably foreseeable releases'') shall be projected to be less than the quantities permitted by Table 2 of that regulation's appendix; and (b) for ``very unlikely releases'' (i.e., those estimated to have between one chance in 100 and one chance in 10,000 of occurring over a 10,000 year period), the limits specified in Table 2 would be multiplied by 10. The basis for Table 2 is an upper limit on long term risks of 1,000 health effects over 10,000 years for a repository containing wastes generated from 100,000 metric tons of heavy metal of reactor fuel. For releases involving more than one radionuclide, the allowed release for each radionuclide is reduced to the fraction of its limit that insures that the overall limit on harm is not exceeded. Additionally, to provide confidence needed for compliance with the containment requirements specified above, Sec. 191.14, ``Assurance Requirements'', specifies the disposal of radioactive waste in accordance with seven requirements, relating to prompt disposal of waste; selection and design of disposal systems to keep releases to the accessible environment as small as reasonably achievable; engineered and natural barriers; nonreliance on active institutional controls after closure; passive controls after closure; natural resource areas; and design of disposal systems to allow future recovery of wastes.</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines will be revised as necessary after the adoption of final regulations by the EPA.</p><p class="depth0">The implementation of 40 CFR part 191, subpart B is required by 10 CFR 60.112. 10 CFR 60.113 establishes minimum conditions to be met for engineered components and ground-water flow; specifically: (1) Containment of radioactive waste within the waste packages will be substantially complete for a period to be determined by the NRC taking into account the factors specified in 10 CFR 60.113(b) provided that such period shall be not less than 300 years nor more than 1,000 years after permanent closure of the geologic repository; (2) the release rate of any radionuclide from the engineered barrier system following the containment period shall not exceed one part in 100,000 per year of the inventory of that radionuclide calculated to be present at 1,000 years following permanent closure, or such other fraction of the inventory as may be approved or specified by the NRC, provided that this requirement does not apply to any radionuclide which is released at a rate less than 0.1% of the calculated total release rate limit. The calculated total release rate limit shall be taken to be one part in 100,000 per year of the inventory of radioactive waste originally emplaced in the underground facility that remains after 1,000 years of radioactive decay; and (3) the geologic repository shall be located so that pre-waste-emplacement ground-water travel time along the fastest path of likely radionuclide travel from the disturbed zone to the accessible environment shall be at least 1,000 years or such other travel time as may be approved or specified by the NRC.</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines will be revised as necessary to ensure consistency with 10 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The latter are generally less restrictive than 40 CFR 191, subpart A, but may be limiting under certain conditions (i.e., if used as a maximum for short durations rather than annual averages).</p><p class="depth0">The guidelines will be revised as necessary to ensure consistency with 10 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Sec. Appendix IV to Part 960--Types of Information for the Nomination of</p><p class="depth0">Sites as Suitable for Characterization</p><p class="depth0">The types of information specified below are those that the DOE expects will be included in the evidence used for evaluations and applications of the guidelines of subparts C and D at the time of nomination of a site as suitable for characterization. The types of information listed under each guideline are considered to be the most significant for the evaluation of that guideline. However, the types of information listed under any particular guideline will be used, as necessary, for the evaluation of any other guideline. As stated in Sec. 960.3-1-4-2, the DOE will use technically conservative assumptions or extrapolations of regional data, where necessary, to supplement this information. The information specified below will be supplemented with conceptual models, as appropriate, and analyses of uncertainties in the data.</p><p class="depth0">Before site-characterization studies and related nongeologic data gathering activities, the evidence is not expected to provide precise information, but, rather, to provide a reasonable basis for assessing the merits or shortcomings of the site against the guidelines of subparts C and D. Consequently, the types of information described below should be interpreted so as to accommodate differences among sites and differences in the information acquired before detailed studies.</p><p class="depth0">The specific information required for the guideline applications set forth in appendix III of this part is expected to differ from site to site because of site-specific factors, both with regard to favorable and potentially adverse conditions and with regard to the sources and reliability of the information.
