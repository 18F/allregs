Accessorial charges shall include the cost of insuring such goods and effects for their actual value or $10,000, whichever is least, against loss or damage in transit, if a bid from a licensed insurer is obtained by the individual and approved by the State agency before departure. If a State agency finds it is more economical to pay a carrier an extra charge to assume the responsibility of a common carrier for such goods and effects, 90 percent of such extra charge, but not exceeding $50, shall be paid in lieu of the cost of insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trailer or rental truck--(i) Trailer. If household goods and personal effects are moved by trailer, the allowable costs shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the trailer is hauled by private vehicle, the cost per mile for the use of the private vehicle at the prevailing mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations (see 41 CFR part 101-7) for the usually traveled route from the individual's old residence to

If household goods and personal effects are moved by rental truck of the type customarily used for moving household goods and personal effects, the allowable costs shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rental fee for each day reasonably required to complete the move; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The necessary fuel for such rental truck paid by the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> House trailer. If a house trailer or mobile home was used as the individual's place of residence in the old area and will be so used in the new area, the allowable costs of moving such house trailer or mobile home shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The commercial carrier's charges for moving the house trailer or mobile home;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Charges for unblocking and reblocking;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ferry charges, bridge, road, and tunnel tolls, taxes, fees fixed by a State or local authority for permits to transport the unit in or through its jurisdiction, and retention of necessary flagmen; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The cost of insuring the house trailer or mobile home, and the personal effects of the individual and family, against loss or damage in transit, in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Temporary storage. If temporary storage of household goods and personal effects is necessary, the cost of such temporary storage for a period not to exceed 60 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Travel.
