These rights include, among other, the right of an employee  to decline to perform his or her assigned task because of a reasonable  belief that, under the circumstances the task poses an imminent risk of  death or serious bodily harm coupled with a reasonable belief that there  is insufficient time to seek effective redress through normal hazard  reporting and abatement procedures established in accordance with this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Based on the Secretary's evaluation of agencies' procedures for  protecting employees from reprisal, the Secretary shall report to the  President by September 30, 1982 his findings and recommendations for  improvements in procedures for the investigation and resolution of  allegations of reprisal.</p>
