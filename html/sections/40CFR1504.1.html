It  provides means for early resolution of such disagreements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under section 309 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7609), the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is directed to  review and comment publicly on the environmental impacts of Federal  activities, including actions for which environmental impact statements  are prepared. If after this review the Administrator determines that the  matter is ``unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health or  welfare or environmental quality,'' section 309 directs that the matter  be referred to the Council (hereafter ``environmental referrals'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Under section 102(2)(C) of the Act other Federal agencies may  make similar reviews of environmental impact statements, including  judgments on the acceptability of anticipated environmental impacts.  These reviews   must be made available to the President, the Council and the public.  [43 FR 55998, Nov. 29, 1978]</p>
