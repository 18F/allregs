                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duty to equip and record. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section, a train operated faster than 30 miles per hour  shall have an in-   service event recorder, of the type described in paragraph (b) of this  section, in the lead locomotive. The presence of the event recorder  shall be noted on Form FRA F6180-49A (by writing the make and model of  event recorder with which the locomotive is equipped) under the REMARKS  section, except that an event recorder designed to allow the locomotive  to assume the lead position only if the recorder is properly functioning  is not required to have its presence noted on Form FRA F6180-49A. For  the purpose of this section, ``train'' includes a locomotive or group of  locomotives with or without cars. The duty to equip the lead locomotive  may be met with an event recorder located elsewhere than the lead  locomotive provided that such event recorder monitors and records the  required data as though it were located in the lead locomotive. The  event recorder shall record the most recent 48 hours of operation of the  electrical system of the locomotive on which it is installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equipment requirements. Event recorders shall monitor and record  data elements required by this paragraph with at least the accuracy  required of the indicators displaying any of the required elements to  the engineer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A lead locomotive originally ordered before October 1, 2006, and  placed in service before October 1, 2009, including a controlling remote  distributed power locomotive, a lead manned helper locomotive, a DMU  locomotive, and an MU locomotive, except as provided in paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section, shall have an in-service event recorder that  records the following data elements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Train speed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Selected direction of motion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Distance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Throttle position;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Applications and operations of the train automatic air brake;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Applications and operations of the independent brake;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Applications and operations of the dynamic brake, if so  equipped; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Cab signal aspect(s), if so equipped and in use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A locomotive originally manufactured before October 1, 2006, and  equipped with an event recorder that uses magnetic tape as its recording  medium shall have the recorder removed from service on or before October  1, 2009 and replaced with an event recorder with a certified crashworthy  event recorder memory module that meets the requirements of appendix D  of this part and that records at least the same number of data elements  as the recorder it replaces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A lead locomotive, a lead manned helper locomotive, and a  controlling remotely distributed power locomotive, other than a DMU or  MU locomotive, originally ordered on or after October 1, 2006 or placed  in service on or after October 1, 2009, shall be equipped with an event  recorder with a certified crashworthy event recorder memory module that  meets the requirements of Appendix D of this part. The certified event  recorder memory module shall be mounted for its maximum protection.  (Although other mounting standards may meet this standard, an event  recorder memory module mounted behind and below the top of the collision  posts and above the platform level is deemed to be mounted ``for its  maximum protection.'')

Notwithstanding the duty established in  paragraph (a) of this section to equip certain locomotives with an in- service event recorder, a railroad may remove an event recorder from  service and, if a railroad knows that an event recorder is not  monitoring or recording required data, shall remove the event recorder  from service. When a railroad removes an event recorder from service, a  qualified person shall record the date that the device was removed from  service on Form FRA F6180-49A, under the REMARKS section, unless the  event recorder is designed to allow the locomotive to assume the lead  position only if the recorder is properly functioning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Preserving accident data. If any locomotive equipped with an  event recorder, or any other locomotive-mounted recording device or  devices designed to record information concerning the functioning of a  locomotive or train, is involved in an accident/incident that is  required to be reported to FRA under part 225 of this chapter, the  railroad that was using the locomotive at the time of the accident  shall, to the extent possible, and to the extent consistent with the  safety of life and property, preserve the data recorded by each such  device for analysis by FRA. This preservation requirement permits the  railroad to extract and analyze such data, provided the original  downloaded data file, or an unanalyzed exact copy of it, shall be  retained in secure custody and shall not be utilized for analysis or any  other purpose except by direction of FRA or the National Transportation  Safety Board. This preservation requirement shall expire one (1) year  after the date of the accident unless FRA or the Board notifies the  railroad in writing that the data are desired for analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Relationship to other laws. Nothing in this section is intended  to alter the   legal authority of law enforcement officials investigating potential  violation(s) of State criminal law(s), and nothing in this chapter is  intended to alter in any way the priority of National Transportation  Safety Board investigations under 49 U.S.C. 1131 and 1134, nor the  authority of the Secretary of Transportation to investigate railroad  accidents under 49 U.S.C. 5121, 5122, 20107, 20111, 20112, 20505, 20702,  20703, and 20902.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disabling event recorders. Except as provided in paragraph (c)  of this section, any individual who willfully disables an event recorder  is subject to civil penalty and to disqualification from performing  safety-sensitive functions on a railroad as provided in Sec. 218.55 of  this chapter, and any individual who tampers with or alters the data  recorded by such a device is subject to a civil penalty as provided in  appendix B of part 218 of this chapter and to disqualification from  performing safety-sensitive functions on a railroad if found unfit for  such duties under the procedures in part 209 of this chapter.
