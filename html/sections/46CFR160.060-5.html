Reinforcing strips of the same material as the envelope shall be stitched to the inside of the front piece of the envelope in way of the strap attachments as shown by the drawings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Buoyant inserts. The unicellular plastic foam buoyant inserts shall be cut and formed as shown on Dwg. No. 160.060-1, Sheets 4, 5, and 6 for the adult, child medium, and child small sizes, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tie tapes, body straps, and hardware.
