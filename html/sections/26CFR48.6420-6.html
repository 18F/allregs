                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Every person making a claim for credit or payment under section 6420 must keep records sufficient to enable the district director to determine whether the person is entitled to credit or payment under section 6420 and, if so, the amount of the credit or payment. No particular form is prescribed for keeping the records, but the records must include a copy of the income tax return or claim and a copy of any statement or document submitted with the return or claim. The records

must also show with respect to the taxable year covered by the claim--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of gallons of gasoline purchased and the dates of purchase,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name and address of each vendor from whom gasoline was purchased and the total number of gallons purchased from each,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of gallons of gasoline purchased by the claimant and used during the taxable year for farming purposes on a farm of which the claimant is the owner, tenant, or operator,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The number of gallons of gasoline used during the taxable year for the purposes described in section 6420(c)(3)(A) and Sec. 48.6420-4(d) (relating to cultivating, raising, or harvesting) by a person other than the owner, tenant, or operator on a farm of which the claimant is the owner, tenant, or operator, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Other information as necessary to establish the correctness of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable records.

Sec. 48.6420(a)-2  Gasoline includible in claim.</p><p class="depth3">Payment may be claimed under section 6420 only in respect of gasoline used on a farm in the United States for farming purposes. No payment is allowable under section 6420 with respect to gasoline used for nonfarming purposes, or gasoline used off a farm, regardless of the nature of such use. If a vehicle or other equipment is used both on a farm and off the farm, or if it is used on a farm both for farming and nonfarming purposes, payment is allowable only with respect to that portion of the gasoline which was ``used on a farm for farming purposes'' as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 48.6420(c)-1. The type of equipment or vehicle and whether or not it is registered for highway use is immaterial. However, the actual use of the equipment or vehicle and place where it is used are material. For example, if a truck used on a farm for farming purposes is also used on the highways (even though in connection with operating the farm), the gasoline used in operating the truck on the

highways is not to be taken into account in computing the payment for which a claim is filed, since such gasoline was used off the farm.
