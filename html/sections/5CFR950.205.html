Organizations may appeal the Director's decision by submitting a written request to reconsider the denial to the Director. This request must be received within 10 business days from the date of receipt of the Director's decision to deny eligibility and shall be limited to those facts justifying the reversal of the original decision.

The LFCC must consider all timely appeals and notify the appealing organization within a reasonable time period. Denial of the appeal by the LFCC must be sent via U.S. Postal Service certified or registered mail with a return receipt. Approval of local appeals may be sent via U.S. Postal Service regular first class mail or facsimile.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A local applicant which is unsuccessful in its appeal to the LFCC may appeal to the Director.
