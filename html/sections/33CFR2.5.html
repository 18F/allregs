navigation rules created under that Act and the ``inland waters'' definition in 46 CFR 10.103 would control regulations in 46 CFR part 10. Also, in various laws administered and enforced by the Coast Guard, the terms ``State'' and ``United States'' are defined to include some or all of the territories and possessions of the United States. The definitions in Sec. Sec.  2.36 and 2.38 should be considered as supplementary to these statutory definitions and not as interpretive of them.</p>
