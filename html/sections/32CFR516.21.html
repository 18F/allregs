                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A contract might require that the government reimburse  a contractor (or subcontractor) for adverse judgments or litigation  expenses. Unless a contractor or subcontractor facing a lawsuit requests  representation by DOJ, the Army presumes the contractor will obtain  private counsel to defend the case. If the contract so allows, however,  the contractor may request and HQDA may recommend that DOJ represent the  contractor if it is in the best interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actions by SJA or legal adviser. If a contractor or  subcontractor faces litigation and the underlying contract with the  government requires reimbursement for adverse judgments or costs of the  litigation, the SJA or legal adviser, through the contracting officer,  should determine if the contractor desires representation by DOJ. If so,  the contractor or authorized agent will sign a request for  representation. (See figure D-3, appendix G, of this part.) The SJA or  legal adviser will determine whether, in his opinion, representation by  DOJ should be granted. He will prepare a memorandum to support his  recommendation, especially concerning any issue regarding the  government's obligation to reimburse the contractor under the contract.  The SJA or legal adviser will forward his memorandum, along with the  contractor's request, to Litigation Division.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Actions by Litigation Division. The Chief, Litigation Division,  will evaluate the submission and decide if it is in the Army's best  interest that the request be granted. He will prepare a memorandum  supporting his decision and send the packet to DOJ. The Chief's decision  constitutes the final DA position on the matter. If DOJ grants the  contractor's request, the Chief, Litigation Division, will ensure that  the contractor is notified through the SJA or legal adviser and the  contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Private Counsel. A contractor represented by DOJ may ask that  private counsel assist the DOJ attorney in the litigation. The DOJ  attorney will remain in control of the litigation, and the fees for  private counsel will not be reimbursable except under unusual  circumstances. The contractor must seek both DOJ and DA approval to  employ private counsel when DOJ representation has been granted. Even if  DOJ and DA grant authority to employ private counsel, the contracting  officer will determine whether a contractor will be reimbursed under the  contract for private counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Settlement. The contractor, unless the contract specifies  otherwise, will ultimately decide whether to compromise a suit.  Reimbursement under the contract is determined by the contracting  officer, with the advice of his attorney.</p>
