The project  does not have to be specifically intended for residential use nor does  it have to be totally new construction. If the project is designed to  provide upgraded service to existing development as well as to serve new  development, only that portion of the increased capacity which is  intended to serve new development should be counted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, on the basis of an EA, a responsible entity determines that  the thresholds in paragraph (b) of this section are the sole reason for  the EIS, the responsible entity may prepare a FONSI pursuant to 40 CFR  1501.4. In such cases, the FONSI must be made available for public  review for at least 30 days before the responsible entity makes the  final determination whether to prepare an EIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, an  EIS is not required where Sec. 58.53 is applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recommended EIS Format. The responsible entity must use the EIS  format recommended by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10) unless a  determination is made on a particular project that there is a compelling  reason to do otherwise. In such a case, the EIS format must meet the  minimum requirements prescribed in 40 CFR 1502.10.</p>
