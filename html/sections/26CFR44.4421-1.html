                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Wager. The term ``wager'' means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any wager placed with a person engaged in the business of  accepting wagers upon the outcome of a sports event or a contest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any wager placed in a wagering pool with respect to a sports  event or a contest, if such pool is conducted for profit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any wager placed in a lottery conducted for profit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lottery--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``lottery'' includes the  numbers game, policy, and similar types of wagering. In general, a  lottery conducted for profit includes any scheme or method for the  distribution of prizes among persons who have paid or promised a  consideration for a chance to win such prizes, usually as determined by  the numbers or symbols on tickets as drawn from a lottery wheel or other  receptacle, or by the outcome of an event: Provided, Such lottery is  conducted for profit. The term also includes enterprises commonly known  as ``policy'' or ``numbers'' and similar types of wagering where the  player selects a number, or a combination of numbers, and pays or agrees  to pay a certain amount in consideration of which the operator of the  lottery, policy, or numbers game agrees to pay a prize or fixed sum of  money if the selected number or combination of numbers appear or are  published in a manner understood by the parties. For example, the  winning number or combination of numbers may appear or be published as a  series of numbers in the payoff prices of a series of horse races at a  certain race track, or in the United States Treasury balance reports, or  the reports of a stock or commodity exchange. This description is not  intended to be restrictive; hence, the substitution of letters or other  symbols for numbers or a different arrangement for determining the  winning number or combination of numbers, does not alter the fundamental  nature of a game which otherwise would be considered a lottery. The  operation of a punch board or a similar gaming device for profit is also  considered to be the operation of a lottery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain games excluded--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cards, dice, etc. Section 4421  specifically excludes from the term ``lottery'' any game of a type in  which usually (a) the wagers are placed, (b) the winners are determined,  and (c) the distribution of prizes or other property is made, in the  presence of all persons placing wagers in such game. Thus, for example,  no tax would be payable with respect to wagers made in a bingo or keno  game since such a game is usually conducted under circumstances in which  the wagers are placed, the winners are determined, and the distribution  of prizes is made in the presence of all persons participating in the  game. For the same reason, no tax would apply in the case of card games,  dice games, or games involving wheels of chance, such as roulette wheels  and gambling wheels of a type used at carnivals and public fairs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Drawings conducted by an organization exempt from tax under  section 501 or 521. Section 4421 specifically excludes from the term  ``lottery'' any drawing conducted by an organization exempt from tax  under section 501 or 521 if no part of the net proceeds derived from  such drawing inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or  individual. For provisions relating to exemption from income tax under  section 501 or 521, see the Income Tax Regulations (Part 1 of this  chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other terms used--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wagering pool. A wagering pool conducted  for profit includes any scheme or method for the distribution of prizes  to one or more winning bettors based upon the outcome of a sports event  or a contest, or a combination or series of such events or contests,  provided such wagering pool is managed and conducted for the purpose of  making a profit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sports event. A sports event includes every type of sports  event, whether amateur, scholastic, or professional, such as horse  racing, auto racing, dog racing, boxing and wrestling matches and  exhibitions, baseball, football, and basketball games, tennis and golf  matches, track meets, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contest. A contest includes any type of contest involving speed,  skill,   endurance, popularity, politics, strength, appearances, etc., such as a  general or primary election, the outcome of a nominating convention, a  dance marathon, a log-rolling, wood-chopping, weight-lifting, corn- husking, beauty contest, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conducted for profit. A wagering pool or lottery may be  conducted for profit even though a direct profit will not inure from the  operation thereof. A wagering pool or lottery operated with the  expectancy of a profit in the form of increased sales, increased  attendance, or other indirect benefits is conducted for profit for  purposes of the wagering tax.</p>
