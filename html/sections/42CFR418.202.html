                            <p class="depth0">All services must be performed by appropriately qualified personnel,  but it is the nature of the service, rather than the qualification of  the person who provides it, that determines the coverage category of the  service. The following services are covered hospice services:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a  registered nurse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medical social services provided by a social worker under the  direction of a physician.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Physicians' services performed by a physician as defined in  Sec. 410.20 of this chapter except that the services of the hospice  medical director or the physician member of the interdisciplinary group  must be performed by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Counseling services provided to the terminally ill individual  and the family members or other persons caring for the individual at  home. Counseling, including dietary counseling, may be provided both for  the purpose of training the individual's family or other caregiver to  provide care, and for the purpose of helping the individual and those  caring for him or her to adjust to the individual's approaching death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> regarding staffing and  patient areas. Services provided in an inpatient setting must conform to  the written plan of care. Inpatient care may be required for procedures  necessary for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management.  Inpatient care may also be furnished as a means of providing respite for  the individual's family or other persons caring for the individual at  home. Respite care must be furnished as specified in Sec. 418.108(b).  Payment for inpatient care   will be made at the rate appropriate to the level of care as specified  in Sec. 418.302.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Medical appliances and supplies, including drugs and  biologicals.

Equipment is provided by the hospice for use in the patient's  home while he or she is under hospice care. Medical supplies include  those that are part of the written plan of care and that are for  palliation and management of the terminal or related conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Home health or hospice aide services furnished by qualified  aides as designated in Sec. 418.76 and homemaker services. Home health  aides (also known as hospice aides) may provide personal care services  as defined in Sec. 409.45(b) of this chapter. Aides may perform  household services to maintain a safe and sanitary environment in areas  of the home used by the patient, such as changing bed linens or light  cleaning and laundering essential to the comfort and cleanliness of the  patient. Aide services must be provided under the general supervision of  a registered nurse. Homemaker services may include assistance in  maintenance of a safe and healthy environment and services to enable the  individual to carry out the treatment plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language  pathology services in addition to the services described in Sec. 409.33  (b) and (c) of this chapter provided for purposes of symptom control or  to enable the patient to maintain activities of daily living and basic  functional skills.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Effective April 1, 1998, any other service that is specified in  the patient's plan of care as reasonable and necessary for the  palliation and management of the patient's terminal illness and related  conditions and for which payment may otherwise be made under Medicare.
