Such statement shall  consist of notarized copies of the appraisals obtained under Sec.  882.12 and may include an account of moneys expended for the reclamation  work. The amount reported to be the increase in value of the property  shall constitute the lien to be recorded in compliance with existing  Federal, State or Indian tribal laws: Provided, however, That prior to  the time of the actual filing of the proposed lien, the landowner shall  be notified of the amount of the proposed lien and shall be allowed a  reasonable time to prepay that amount instead of allowing the   lien to be filed against the property involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 60 days after the lien is filed the landowner may  petition under local law to determine the increase in market value of  the land as a result of reclamation work. Any aggrieved party may appeal  in the manner provided by local law.  [47 FR 28599, June 30, 1982, as amended at 73 FR 67642, Nov. 14, 2008]</p>
