A creditor's failure to comply with Sec. Sec. 202.6(b)(6), 202.9, 202.10, 202.12 or 202.13 is not a violation if it results from an inadvertent error. On discovering an error under Sec. Sec. 202.9 and 202.10, the creditor shall

correct it as soon as possible. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by Sec. 202.13, the creditor may retain information and act on the application without violating the regulation.
