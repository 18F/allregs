A nonqualified withdrawal made without the prior written permission of the Maritime Administrator shall constitute a material breach of the agreement unless the Maritime Administrator shall determine that failure to obtain prior written consent was excusable.

control or due to a change in circumstances which makes the completion of its program economically unfeasible.
