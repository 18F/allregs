                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has a responsibility to help the grantee be successful and help the grantee avoid cases of fraud and abuse. Servicing actions also include correlating activities between the grantee and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the benefit of the participating families. The amount of servicing actions needed will vary in accordance with the experience of the grantee, but as minimum the following actions are required:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monthly, the grantee will provide the District Director with a request for additional funds on Form SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement.'' This request need only show the amount of funds used during the previous month, amount of unspent funds, projected need for the next 30 days, and written justification if the request exceeds the projected need for the next 30 days. This request must be in the District Director's office fifteen days prior to the beginning of the month. Upon receipt of the grantee's request, the District Director will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the request appears to be in order, process Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-57 so that delivery of the check will be possible on the first of the next month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the request does not appear to be in order, immediately contact the grantee to resolve the problem. After the contact:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the explanation is acceptable, process Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-57 so delivery may be possible by the first of the next month, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the explanation is not acceptable, immediately notify the grantee and request the amount of funds that appear reasonable for the next 30 days on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-57, so that delivery may be possible by the first of

the next month. Unapproved funds that are later approved will be added to the next month's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Quarterly, the grantee will submit exhibit B of this subpart in an original and three copies to the County Supervisor on or before January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 which will verify its progress toward meeting the objectives stated in the Agreement and the application. The County Supervisor will immediately complete the County Office review part and forward the report to the District Office. After exhibit B is received in the District Office, a meeting should be scheduled between the grantee, District Director, and the County supervisor since this is an opportune time for both the grantee and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to review progress to date and make necessary adjustments for the future. This meeting is required if the grantee was previously identified as a problem grantee or will be identified as a problem grantee at this time. Regardless of whether a meeting will be held, the following will be done:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exhibit B and other information will be evaluated to determine progress made to date. The District Director will comment on exhibit B as to whether the grantee is ahead or behind schedule in each of the following areas:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assisting the projected number of families.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Serving very low-income applicants. Is the grantee reaching a minimum of very low-income families as required in exhibit A, attachment 2 to subpart L of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Equivalent units (EUs). Is the number of EUs completed representative of lapse in time of the grant? For example, if 25 percent of the grant period has elapsed, are 25 percent of the number of EUs completed?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Labor contributions by the family. Are the families working together and are they completing the labor tasks as established on exhibit B-2?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The District Director will submit exhibit B to the State Director who will evaluate the quarterly report along with the District Director's comments. If the State Director determines the grantee is progressing satisfactorily, the State Director will sign and forward exhibit B to the National Office. However, if the State Director determines the grantee is not performing as expected, the State Director will notify the grantee that it has been classified a ``High Risk'' grantee. The notice will specify the deficiencies and inform the grantee of proposed remedies for noncompliance. The notice will advise the grantee that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is available to assist and provide the name and address of an organization that is under contract with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to assist them. The State Director will forward a copy of exhibit B, District Directors comments, and the reasons for classifying them as ``High Risk'' to the National Office, Single Family Housing, Special Programs Branch. When the period of time provided for corrective action has expired, an assessment will be made of the progress by the grantee toward correcting the situation. If the State Director determines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The situation has been corrected or reasonable progress has been made toward correcting the situation, the ``High Risk'' status will be lifted and the grantee so notified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The situation has not been corrected but it is correctable if additional time is granted, an extension will be issued.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The situation has not been corrected and it is unlikely to be corrected if given additional time, the grant will be terminated under Sec. 1944.426(b)(1) of this subpart.
