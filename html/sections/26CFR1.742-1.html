                                Sec. 1.742-1  Basis of transferee partner's interest.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The basis to a transferee partner of an interest in a partnership  shall be determined under the general basis rules for property provided  by part II (section 1011 and following), subchapter O, chapter 1 of the  Code. Thus, the basis of a purchased interest will be its cost. The  basis of a partnership interest acquired from a decedent is the fair  market value of the interest at the date of his death or at the  alternate valuation date, increased by his estate's or other successor's  share of partnership liabilities, if any, on that date, and reduced to  the extent that such value is attributable to items constituting income  in respect of a decedent (see section 753 and paragraph (c)(3)(v) of  Sec. 1.706-1 and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.753-1) under section 691. See  section 1014(c). For basis of contributing partner's interest, see  section 722. The basis so determined is then subject to the adjustments  provided in section 705.</p>
