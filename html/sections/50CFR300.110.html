                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The use of pelagic and bottom trawls having the mesh size in any  part of a trawl less than indicated is prohibited for any directed  fishing for the following Antarctic finfishes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notothenia rossii and Dissostichus eleginoides--120 mm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Champsocephalus gunnari--90 mm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Notothenia kempi and Lepidorhirus  squamifrons--80 mm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any means or device that would reduce the size or obstruct the  opening of the meshes is prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following procedure will be used for determining compliance  with mesh size requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description of gauges. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gauges for determining mesh sizes  will be 2 mm thick, flat, of durable material and capable of retaining  their shape. They may have either a series of parallel-edged sides  connected by intermediate tapering edges with a taper of one to eight on  each side, or only tapering edges with the taper defined above. They  will have a hole at the narrowest extremity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each gauge will be inscribed on its face with the width in  millimeters both on the parallel-sided section, if any, and on the  tapering section. In the case of the latter, the width will be inscribed  every 1 mm interval, but the indication of the width may appear at  regular intervals other than 1 mm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of the gauge. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The net will be stretched in the direction  of the long diagonal of the meshes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A gauge as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will  be inserted by its narrowest extremity into the mesh opening in a  direction perpendicular to the plane of the net.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The gauge may be inserted into the mesh opening either with a  manual force or using a weight or dynamometer, until it is stopped at  the tapering edges by the resistance of the mesh.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Selection of meshes to be measured. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meshes to be measured  will form a series of 20 consecutive meshes chosen in the direction of  the long axis of the net, except that the meshes to be measured need not  be consecutive if the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this  section prevents it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Meshes less than 50 cm from lacings, ropes, or codline will not  be measured. This distance will be measured perpendicular to the  lacings, ropes or codline with the net stretched in the direction of  that measurement. No mesh will be measured which has been mended or  broken or has attachments to the net fixed at that mesh.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Nets will be measured only when wet and unfrozen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The measurement of each mesh will be the width of the gauge at  the point where the gauge is stopped, when using this gauge in  accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determination of the mesh size of the net will be the  arithmetical mean in millimeters of the measurements of the total number  of meshes selected and measured as provided for in paragraphs (c) (3)  and (4) of this section, the arithmetical mean being rounded up to the  next millimeter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inspection procedure. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One series of 20 meshes, selected in  accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be measured by  inserting the gauge manually without using a weight or dynamometer. The  mesh size of the net will then be determined in accordance with  paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If the calculation of the mesh size  shows that the mesh size does not appear to comply with the rules in  force, then two additional series of 20 meshes selected in accordance  with paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be measured. The mesh size  will then be recalculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this  section, taking into account the 60 meshes already measured; this  recalculation will be the mesh size of the net.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the captain of the vessel contests the mesh size determined  in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, such measurement  will not be considered for the determination of the mesh size and the  net will be remeasured.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A weight or dynamometer attached to the gauge will be used for  remeasurement. The choice of weight or dynamometer is at the discretion  of the inspectors. The weight will be fixed to the hole in the narrowest  extremity of the gauge using a hook. The dynamometer may either be fixed  to the hole in the narrowest extremity of the gauge or be applied at the  largest extremity of the gauge.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The accuracy of the weight or dynamometer must be certified by  the appropriate national authority.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For nets of a mesh size of 35 mm or less as determined in  accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, a force of 19.61  newtons (equivalent to a mass of 2 kg) will be applied, and for other  nets, a force of 49.03 newtons (equivalent to a mass of 5 kg).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For the purposes of determining the mesh size in accordance with  paragraph (c)(5) of this section, when using a weight or dynamometer,  one series of 20 meshes only will be measured.</p>
