                                Sec. 1100.29  The roles and responsibilities of federal law   the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA).

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Department of Justice officials. The various agencies, bureaus,  boards, divisions, programs, and offices of the DOJ have most of the  responsibilities assigned by section 107(c). The goals of section 107(c)  are to identify victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons as  early as possible in the investigation and prosecution process, to  ensure efforts are made to see that such victims are accorded the rights  described in 42 U.S.C. 10606, and to provide the protections and  services required under 42 U.S.C. 10607 and under the TVPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Department of State officials. Department of State missions  throughout the world are often the initial contact for aliens in foreign  countries who wish to come to the United States. Appropriate DOS  personnel should be trained in identifying victims of severe forms of  trafficking in persons. Furthermore, considering the international  nature of trafficking in persons, appropriate DOS personnel, upon  encountering victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in  foreign countries, should consider referrals to local law enforcement or  service providers in the host country, but only if the local host  country conditions support such actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal law enforcement officials. Federal law enforcement  officials who, during the performance of their duties, encounter a  person whom they believe may be a victim of a severe form of trafficking  in persons as defined by this subpart, are responsible for bringing such  an individual to the attention of those federal law enforcement  officials primarily responsible for enforcing trafficking laws,  specifically INS or FBI. In addition, DOS's Diplomatic Security Service  has investigative authority in visa and passport fraud cases that may  involve trafficking in persons. Federal law enforcement officials also  include federal law enforcement personnel working cooperatively with law  enforcement officials who have primary investigative jurisdiction in  such trafficking cases. Each federal agency having law enforcement  responsibilities should ensure that its officers are trained in  identifying victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons, and are  familiar with the rights, services, and protections such victims are to  be accorded under the TVPA and 42 U.S.C. 10606 and 10607.</p>
