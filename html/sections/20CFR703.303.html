                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Branch will issue a decision granting or denying the  employer's application to be an authorized self-insurer. If the Branch  grants the application, the decision will fix the amount of security the  employer must deposit. The Branch will transmit its decision to the  employer in a way it considers appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employer is authorized to self-insure beginning with the  date of the Branch's decision. Each grant of authority to self-insure is  conditioned, however, upon the employer's execution and filing of an  Agreement and Undertaking and deposit of the security fixed in the  decision in the form and within the time limits required by Sec.  703.304. In the event the employer fails to comply with the requirements  set forth in Sec. 703.304, its authorization to self-insure will be  considered never to have been effective, and the employer will be  subject to appropriate penalties for failure to secure its LHWCA  obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Branch will require security in the amount it considers  necessary to fully secure the employer's LHWCA obligations. When fixing  the amount of security, the Branch may consider a number of factors  including, but not limited to, the--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employer's overall financial standing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nature of the employer's work;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hazard of the work in which the employees are employed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Employer's payroll amount for employees engaged in employment  within the purview of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employer's accident record as shown in the application and the  Office's records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an employer believes that the Branch incorrectly denied its  application to self-insure, or that a lesser security deposit would  fully secure its LHWCA obligations, the employer may request a hearing  before the Director of the Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers'  Compensation (Longshore Director) or the Longshore Director's  representative. Requests for hearing must be in writing and sent to the  Branch within ten days of the date of the Branch's decision. The  employer may submit new evidence and/or argument in support of its  challenge to the Branch's decision and must provide any additional  documentation OWCP requests. The Longshore Director or his  representative will notify the employer of the hearing date within 10  days of receiving the request. The Longshore Director or his  representative will issue the final agency decision on the application  within 60 days of the hearing date, or, where evidence is submitted  after the hearing, within 60 days of the receipt of such evidence, but  no later than 180 days after receiving the employer's request for a  hearing.</p>
