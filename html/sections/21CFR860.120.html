                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 513(e) and (f), 514(b), 515(b), and 520(l) of the act provide for reclassification of a device and prescribe the procedures to be followed to effect reclassification. The purposes of subpart C are to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Set forth the requirements as to form and content of petitions for reclassification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe the circumstances in which each of the five statutory reclassification provisions applies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Explain the procedure for reclassification prescribed in the five statutory reclassification provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The criteria for determining the proper class for a device are set forth in Sec. 860.3(c). The reclassification of any device within a generic type of device causes the reclassification of all substantially equivalent devices within

that generic type. Accordingly, a petition for the reclassification of a specific device will be considered a petition for reclassification of all substantially equivalent devices within the same generic type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any interested person may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(e), 514(b), or 515(b). A manufacturer or importer may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(f) or 520(l). The Commissioner may initiate the reclassification of a device classified into class III under sections 513(f) and 520(l) of the act.
