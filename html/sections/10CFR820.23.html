                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Settlement policy. DOE encourages settlement of an enforcement  proceeding at any time if the settlement is consistent with the  objectives of the Act and the DOE Nuclear Safety Requirements. The  Director and a person may confer at any time concerning settlement.  These settlement conferences shall not be open to the public and there  shall be no transcript.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consent order. Notwithstanding any other provision of this part,  DOE may at any time resolve any or all issues in an outstanding  enforcement proceeding with a Consent Order. A Consent Order must be  signed by the Director and the person who is its subject, or a duly  authorized representative, must indicate agreement to the terms  contained therein and must be filed. A Consent Order need not constitute  an admission by any person that the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety  Requirement has been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the  DOE that such person has violated the Act or a DOE Nuclear Safety  Requirement. A Consent Order shall, however, set forth the relevant  facts which form the basis for the Order and what remedy, if any, is  imposed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect on enforcement adjudication. If a Consent Order is signed  after the commencement of an enforcement adjudication, the adjudication  of the issues subject to the Consent Order shall be stayed until the  completion of the Secretarial Review Process. If the Consent Order  becomes a Final Order, the adjudication shall be terminated or modified  as specified in the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Secretarial review. A Consent Order shall become a Final Order  30 days after it is filed unless the Secretary files a rejection of the  Consent Order or a Modified Consent Order. A Modified Consent Order  shall become a Final Order if the Director and the person who is its  subject sign it within 15 days of its filing.</p>
