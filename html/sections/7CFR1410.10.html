Transferred acreage shall be terminated from the CRP effective the day a WRP easement is filed. Participants will receive a prorated CRP annual payment for that part of the year the acreage was enrolled in the CRP according to Sec. 1410.42. Refunds of cost-share payments or applicable incentive payments need not be refunded unless specified by the Deputy Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An owner or operator who has enrolled acreage in the CRP may, as determined and approved by CCC, restore suitable acres to wetlands with cost-share assistance provided that Federal cost-share assistance has not been received for wetland restoration on the same land. In addition to the cost-share limitation in Sec. 1410.41, an additional one-time financial incentive may be provided to encourage restoration of the hydrology of the site.</p>
