                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An owner or operator who entered into a CRP contract on land that is suitable for restoration to wetlands or that was restored to wetlands while under such contract, may, if approved by the Deputy Administrator, subject to any restrictions as may be imposed by law, apply to transfer such acres that are devoted to an approved cover from CRP to a wetland reserve easement under WRP or ACEP, as appropriate. Transferred acreage will be terminated from CRP effective the day a WRP or ACEP wetland reserve easement is filed. Participants will receive a prorated CRP annual payment for the part of the year the acreage was enrolled in CRP as specified in Sec. 1410.42. Cost-share payments or applicable incentive payments need not be refunded unless specified by the Deputy Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An owner or operator who has enrolled acreage in the CRP may, as determined and approved by the Deputy Administrator, restore suitable acres to wetlands with cost-share assistance provided that Federal cost-share assistance has not been received for wetland restoration on the same land. In addition to the cost-share limitation in Sec. 1410.41, an additional one-time financial incentive may be provided to encourage restoration of the hydrology of the site.
