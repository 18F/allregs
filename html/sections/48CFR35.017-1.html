The sponsoring agreement may take various forms; it may be  included in a contract between the Government and the FFRDC, or in  another legal instrument under which an FFRDC accomplishes effort, or it  may be in a separate written agreement. Notwithstanding its form, the  sponsoring agreement shall be clearly designated as such by the sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While the specific content of any sponsoring agreement will vary  depending on the situation, the agreement shall contain, as a minimum,  the requirements of paragraph (c) of this subsection. The requirements  for, and the contents of, sponsoring agreements may be as further  specified in sponsoring agencies' policies and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a minimum, the following requirements must be addressed in  either a sponsoring agreement or sponsoring agencies' policies and  procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the purpose and mission of the FFRDC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provisions for the orderly termination or nonrenewal of the  agreement, disposal of assets, and settlement of liabilities.

This prohibition is not required to be  applied to any parent organization or other subsidiary of the parent  organization in its non-FFRDC operations. Requests for information,  qualifications or capabilities can be answered unless otherwise  restricted by the sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A delineation of whether or not the FFRDC may accept work from  other than the sponsor(s). If nonsponsor work can be accepted, a  delineation of the procedures to be followed, along with any limitations  as to the nonsponsors form which work can be accepted (other Federal  agencies, State or local governments, nonprofit or profit organizations,  etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The sponsoring agreement or sponsoring agencies' policies and  procedures may also contain, as appropriate, other provisions, such as  identification of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any cost elements which will require advance  agreement if cost-type contracts are used; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Considerations which will affect negotiation of fees where  payment of fees is determined by the sponsor(s) to be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term of the agreement will not exceed 5 years, but can be  renewed, as a result of periodic review, in increments not to exceed 5  years.
