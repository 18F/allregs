                            <p class="depth0">In respect to any securities issued by Federal savings associations, the powers, functions, and duties vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') to administer and enforce sections 10A(m), 12, 13, 14(a),

14(c), 14(d), 14(f), and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the ``Act''); and sections 302, 303, 304, 306, 401(b), 404, 406, and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (codified at 15 U.S.C. 7241, 7242, 7243, 7244, 7261, 7262, 7264, and 7265) are vested in the OCC. The rules, regulations and forms prescribed by the Commission pursuant to those sections or applicable in connection with obligations imposed by those sections, shall apply to securities issued by Federal savings associations, except as otherwise provided in this part. The term ``Securities and Exchange Commission'' or ``Commission'' as used in those rules and regulations shall, with respect to securities issued by Federal savings associations, be deemed to refer to the OCC unless the context otherwise requires. All filings with respect to securities issued by Federal savings associations required by those rules and regulations to be made with the Commission shall be made with the OCC's Securities and Corporate Practices Division. Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by the OCC in the application fee schedule published in the Thrift Bulletin pursuant to 12 CFR part 102, all filing fees specified by the Commission's rules shall be paid to the OCC. If, after the OCC reviews a Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G and determines that the filing is materially deficient such that the OCC requires that an amendment be filed to correct the deficiency, then, upon the filing of the amendment to the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G, as the case may be, the filer shall pay an additional filing fee to the OCC, in the amount specified by the OCC.
