If

it is anticipated that the best price available is the option price or that this is the more advantageous offer, the contracting officer should not use this method of testing the market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An informal analysis of prices or an examination of the market indicates that the option price is better than prices available in the market or that the option is the more advantageous offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time between the award of the contract containing the option and the exercise of the option is so short that it indicates the option price is the lowest price obtainable or the more advantageous offer.

To satisfy requirements of part 6 regarding full and open competition, the option must have been evaluated as part of the initial competition and be exercisable at an amount specified in or reasonably determinable from the terms of the basic contract, e.g.--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A specific dollar amount;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount to be determined by applying provisions (or a formula) provided in the basic contract, but not including renegotiation of the price for work in a fixed-price type contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a cost-type contract, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The option contains a fixed or maximum fee; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fixed or maximum fee amount is determinable by applying a formula contained in the basic contract (but see 16.102(c));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A specific price that is subject to an economic price adjustment provision; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A specific price that is subject to change as the result of changes to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The contract modification or other written document which notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option shall cite the option clause as authority.
