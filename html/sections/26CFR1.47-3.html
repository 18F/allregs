For the taxable year 1962 A's credit earned of $1,400 was allowed under section 38 as a credit against its liability for tax. On January 1, 1963, machine No. 1 is completely destroyed by fire. On January 1, 1963, the adjusted basis of machine No. 1 in A's hands is $24,500. A receives $23,000 in insurance proceeds as compensation for the destroyed machine, and on February 15, 1964, A acquires and places in service machine No. 2, which qualifies as section 38 property, with a basis of $41,000 and an estimated useful life of 6 years to replace machine No. 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does not apply with respect to machine No. 1 since machine No. 2 is placed in service to replace machine No. 1 and the $41,000 basis of machine No. 2 is reduced, under paragraph (h) of Sec.  1.46-3, by $23,000.

Paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 applies with respect to the January 1, 1963, destruction of machine No. 1. The actual useful life of machine No. 1 is 1 year. The recomputed qualified investment with respect to such machine is zero ($30,000 basis multiplied by zero applicable percentage) and A's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is zero.

then such taxpayer may treat the cost of any used section 38 property (regardless of its estimated useful life) which was not originally selected, under paragraph (c)(4) of Sec.  1.48-3, to be taken into account in computing qualified investment for such taxable year (or previously reselected under this subparagraph) as having been selected (in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of Sec.  1.48-3) in place of the cost of the used section 38 property described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Hereinafter such reselected property is referred to as ``newly selected used section 38 property''. For purposes of this subparagraph, the cost of used section 38 property apportioned to a taxpayer means the sum of the cost of used section 38 property apportioned to him by a trust, estate, or electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), and his share of the cost of partnership used section 38 property, with respect to the taxable year of such trust, estate, corporation or partnership ending with or within such taxpayer's taxable year.

provisions of Sec.  1.47-2 (relating to ``disposition'' and ``cessation''), paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 shall not apply to the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph to the extent of the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a taxpayer treats, under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the cost of any used section 38 property which was not originally selected as having been selected in place of the cost of used section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, then, not withstanding the

provisions of Sec.  1.47-2 (relating to ``disposition'' and ``cessation''), paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 shall not apply to the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph to the extent of the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the cost of the used section 38 property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph exceeds the cost of the newly selected used section 38 property, then the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall cease to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer to the extent of such excess.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the newly selected used section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life of the property described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, then, unless he reselects other used section 38 property, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 shall apply with respect to such newly selected used section 38 property.

This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation purchased and placed in service on January 1, 1962, machines No. 1 and No. 2, which qualified as used section 38 property, each with a cost of $50,000 and an estimated useful life of eight years. The aggregate cost of used section 38 property taken into account by X Corporation in computing its qualified investment for the taxable year 1962 could not exceed $50,000; therefore, under paragraph (c)(4) of Sec.  1.48-3, X selected the $50,000 cost of machine No. 1 to be taken into account in computing its qualified investment for the taxable year 1962. The qualified investment with respect to machine No. 1 was $50,000. For the taxable year 1962 X's credit earned of $3,500 was allowed under section 38 as a credit against its liability for tax. On January 2, 1965, X Corporation sells machine No. 1 to Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, X Corporation treats the $50,000 cost of machine No. 2 as having been selected to be taken into account in computing its qualified investment for the taxable year 1962 in place of the $50,000 cost of machine No. 1. Therefore, under subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does not apply to the January 2, 1965, disposition of machine No. 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1 and in addition X Corporation, on December 2, 1966, sells machine No. 2 to Z Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 applies with respect to the December 2, 1966, disposition of machine No. 2. The actual useful life of machine No. 2 is four years and eleven months (that is, the period beginning on January 1, 1962, and ending on December 2, 1966). The recomputed qualified investment with respect to machine No. 2 is $16,667 ($50,000 cost multiplied by 33\1/3\ percent applicable percentage) and X Corporation's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is $1,167. The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X Corporation for the taxable year 1966 is increased by the $2,333 decrease in its credit earned for the taxable year 1962 (that is, $3,500 original credit earned minus $1,167 recomputed credit earned).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1 except that machine No. 2 had a cost of $30,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, X Corporation treats the $30,000 cost of machine No. 2 as having been selected to be taken into account in computing its qualified investment for the taxable year 1962 in place of the $50,000 cost of machine No. 1. Therefore, under subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does

not apply to the January 2, 1965, disposition of machine No. 1 to the extent of $30,000 of the $50,000 cost of machine No. 1. However, under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 applies to the January 2, 1965, disposition of machine No. 1 to the extent of $20,000 (that is, $50,000 cost of machine No. 1 minus $30,000 cost of machine No. 2). The actual useful life of such $20,000 portion of machine No. 1 is three years (that is, the period beginning on January 1, 1962, and ending on January 2, 1965). The recomputed qualified investment with respect to the $20,000 portion of the cost of machine No. 1 is zero ($20,000 portion of the cost multiplied by zero applicable percentage) and X Corporation's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is $2,100 (7 percent of $30,000). The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X Corporation for the taxable year 1965 is increased by the $1,400 decrease in its credit earned for the taxable year 1962 (that is, $3,500 original credit earned minus $2,100 recomputed credit earned).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transactions to which section 381(a) applies--(1) General rule.

The qualified investment with respect to such item was $12,000. For the taxable year 1962 A's credit earned of $840 was allowed under section 38 as a credit against his liability for tax. On March 15, 1963, A transfers all of the assets used in his sole proprietorship to X Corporation, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 45 percent of the stock of X Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does not apply to the March 15, 1963, transfer to X Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1 and in addition on February 2, 1964, X Corporation sells the item of section 38 property to Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does not apply to the March 15, 1963, transfer to X Corporation.

The actual useful life of the property is two years and one month (that is, the period beginning on January 1, 1962, and ending on February 2, 1964). The recomputed qualified investment with respect to such property is zero ($12,000 basis multiplied by zero applicable percentage) and A's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is zero.

Partnership ABC has 10 partners who make their returns on the basis of a calendar year and share partnership profits equally. Each partner's share of the basis of such item of section 38 property is 10 percent, that is, $2,000. On March 15, 1963, partnership ABC transfers all of the assets used in its trade or business to the X Corporation, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for all of the stock of X Corporation and immediately thereafter transfers 10 percent of such stock to each of the 10 partners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does not apply to the March 15, 1963 transfer by the ABC Partnership to X Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 3 except that partnership ABC transfers 10 percent of the stock in X Corporation to each of 8 partners, 20 percent to partner A, and cash to partner B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, with respect to all of the partners (including partner A) except partner B, paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 does not apply to the March 15, 1963, transfer by the ABC Partnership to X Corporation.

The sale and leaseback (or agreement or contract to leaseback) of progress expenditure property (including any contract rights to the property), in general, will be treated as a cessation described in section 47(a)(3)(A) with respect to the seller-lessee. However, a sale and leaseback (or agreement or contract to leaseback) will not be treated as a cessation to the extent qualified investment passed through to the lessee under section 48(d) in the year the property is placed in service equals or exceeds qualified progress expenditures for the property taken into account by the lessee. If a sale-leaseback transaction is treated as a cessation, qualified investment must be reduced and the credit recomputed, beginning with the most recent credit year (i.e., the most recent year property is taken into account in computing qualified investment under Sec.  1.46-3 or 1.46-5). The amount of the reduction is the amount, if any, by which qualified progress expenditures taken into account by the lessee in all prior years exceeds qualified investment passed through to the lessee under section 48(d). This paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to any progress expenditure property that has been placed in service by a vendor-lessee (as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) prior to a sale-leaseback of that property in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Certain property replaced after April 18, 1969--(1) In general.

The preceding sentence shall not apply unless the replacement takes place within 6 months after the disposition. If property otherwise qualifies as replacement property, it is immaterial that it is placed in service (for example, to undergo testing) before the replaced property is disposed of.

On January 1, 1967, A, a calendar year taxpayer, acquired and placed in service a new machine with a basis of $100 and an estimated useful life of 8 years. A's qualified investment was $100 and his credit earned was $7, which was allowed as a credit against tax for 1967. On January 15, 1971. A disposed of the machine and replaced it with a similar new machine costing $75 and having an estimated useful life of 8 years. The new machine would be section 38 property but for section 49. Since the actual useful life of the original machine was at least 4 but less than 6 years, the recomputed qualified investment of the machine is $33.33 (33\1/3\ percent of $100) and under paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.47-1 the amount of recapture tax would be $4.67 ($7, the original credit earned, minus $2.33, the recomputed credit earned). However, under the provisions of this paragraph, the recapture tax is reduced (but not below zero) by

the credit that would be allowed for the replacement property (determined as if such property were section 38 property). Under these facts the recapture tax is zero ($4.67, the recapture tax with respect to the original machine, minus $5.25, the credit that would be allowed on the new machine).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Leased property. Property disposed of may be replaced with property leased from another, provided (i) an election with respect to the newly leased property could be made under section 48(d) but for section 49, and (ii) the lessee obtains the lessor's written statement that he will not claim such property as replacement property under this paragraph. The statement of the lessor shall contain the information specified in subdivisions (i) through (vii) of Sec.  1.48-4(f)(1) and the statement (or a copy thereof) shall be retained in the records of the lessor and the lessee for a period of at least 3 years after the property is transferred to the lessee.
