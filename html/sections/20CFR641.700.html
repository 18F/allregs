                                Sec. 641.700  What performance measures/indicators apply to SCSEP
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Indicators of performance. There are currently eight performance  measures, of which six are core indicators and two are additional  indicators. Core indicators (defined in Sec. 641.710) are subject to  goal-setting and corrective action (described in Sec. 641.720); that  is, performance level goals for each core indicator must be agreed upon  between the Department and each grantee before the start of each program  year, and if a grantee fails to meet the performance level goals for the  core indicators, that grantee is subject to corrective action.  Additional indicators (defined in Sec. 641.710) are not subject to  goal-setting and are, therefore, also not subject to corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of the 2006 OAA establishes  the following core indicators of performance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hours (in the aggregate) of community service employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Entry into unsubsidized employment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retention in unsubsidized employment for six months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Earnings;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number of eligible individuals served; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The number of most-in-need individuals served (the number of  participating individuals described in Sec. 518(a)(3)(B)(ii) or (b)(2)  of the OAA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional indicators. Section 513(b)(2) of the 2006 OAA  establishes the following additional indicators of performance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retention in unsubsidized employment for one year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Satisfaction of the participants, employers, and their host  agencies with their experiences and the services provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other indicators of performance that the Secretary  determines to be appropriate to evaluate services and performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary has designated entry into volunteer work as an  additional indicator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Affected entities. The core indicators of performance and  additional indicators of performance are applicable to each grantee  without regard to whether the grantee operates the program directly or  through sub-contracts, sub-grants, or agreements with other entities.  Grantees must assure that their sub-grantees and lower-tier sub-grantees  are collecting and reporting program data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Required evaluation and reporting. An agreement to be evaluated  on the   core indicators of performance and to report information on the  additional indicators of performance is a requirement for application  for, and is a condition of, all SCSEP grants.  [75 FR 53812, Sept. 1, 2010, as amended at 77 FR 4661, Jan. 31, 2012]</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 77 FR 4661, Jan. 31, 2012, in Sec. 641.700  paragraph (c)(4) was added. This paragraph contains information  collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective  until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
