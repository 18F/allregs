                            <p class="depth0">If you wish to use a resin or gel coat application technology (new  or existing), whose emission characteristics are not represented by the  equations in Table 1 to this subpart, you may use the procedures in  paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section to establish an organic HAP  emissions factor. This organic HAP emissions factor may then be used to  determine compliance with the emission limits in this subpart, and to  calculate facility organic HAP emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Perform an organic HAP emissions test to determine a site- specific organic HAP emissions factor using the test procedures in Sec.  63.5850.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submit a petition to the Administrator for administrative review  of this subpart. This petition must contain a description of the resin  or gel coat application technology and supporting organic HAP emissions  test data obtained using EPA test methods or their equivalent. The  emission test data should be obtained using a range of resin or gel coat  HAP contents to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology under  the different conditions, and to demonstrate that the technology will be  effective at different sites. We will review the submitted data, and, if  appropriate, update the equations in Table 1 to this subpart.</p>
