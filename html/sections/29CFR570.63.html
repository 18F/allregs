As used in this section:</p><p class="depth0">Applicable ANSI Standard means the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990 American National Standard for Refuse Collection, Processing, and Disposal--Baling Equipment--Safety Requirements (ANSI

S245.5-1990) for scrap paper balers or the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992 American National Standard for Refuse Collection, Processing, and Disposal Equipment--Stationary Compactors--Safety Requirements (ANSI Z245.2-1992) for paper box compactors. Additional applicable standards are the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.5-1997 American National Standard for Equipment Technology and Operations for Wastes and Recyclable Materials--Baling Equipment--Safety Requirements (ANSI Z245.5-1997), the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.5-2004 American National Standard for Equipment Technology and Operations for Wastes and Recyclable Materials--Baling Equipment--Safety Requirements for Installation, Maintenance and Operation (ANSI Z245.5-2004), and the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.5-2008 American National Standard for Equipment Technology and Operations for Wastes and Recyclable Materials--Baling Equipment--Safety Requirements (ANSI Z245.5-2008) for scrap paper balers or the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.2-1997 American National Standard for Equipment Technology and Operations for Wastes and Recyclable Materials--Stationary Compactors--Safety Requirements (ANSI Z245.2-1997), the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.2-2004 American National Standard for Equipment Technology and Operations for Wastes and Recyclable Materials--Stationary Compactors--Safety Requirements for Installation, Maintenance and Operation (ANSI Z245.2-2004), and the American National Standard Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.2-2008 American National Standard for Equipment Technology and Operations for Wastes and Recyclable Materials--Stationary Compactors--Safety Requirements for Installation, Maintenance and Operation (ANSI Z245.2-2008) for paper box compactors, which the Secretary has certified to be at least as protective of the safety of minors as Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990 for scrap paper balers or Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992 for paper box compactors. The ANSI standards for scrap paper balers and paper box compactors govern the manufacture and modification of the equipment, the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee training. These ANSI standards are incorporated by reference in this paragraph and have the same force and effect as other standards in this part. Only the mandatory provisions (i.e., provisions containing the word ``shall'' or other mandatory language) of these standards are adopted as standards under this part. These standards are incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of the approval; if any changes are made in these standards which the Secretary finds to be as protective of the safety of minors as the current standards, the Secretary will publish a Notice of the change of standards in the Federal Register. These incorporations by reference were approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of these standards are available for purchase from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 25 West 43rd St., Fourth Floor, New York, NY 10036. The telephone number for ANSI is (212) 642-4900 and its Web site is located at http://www.ansi.org. In addition, these standards are available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call (202) 741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html. These standards are also available for inspection at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Docket Office, Room N-2625, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, or any of its regional offices.
