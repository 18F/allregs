                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Administrative fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As a not-for-profit organization, the  American Arbitration Association shall prescribe an Administrative Fee  Schedule and a Refund Schedule to compensate it for the cost of  providing administrative services. The schedule in effect at the time of  filing or the time of refund shall be applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The administrative fees shall be advanced by the initiating  party or parties, subject to final apportionment by the hearing officer  in the award. The administrative fee is increased by 10 percent of the  original for each additional party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fees and expenses in excess of the limit contained in section  26(b) of TSCA ($2,500 per person, or $100 per small business) will be  paid by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expenses. Subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all  expenses of the hearing, including the cost of recording (though not  transcribing) the hearing and required traveling and other expenses of  the hearing officer and of American Arbitration Association  representatives, and the expenses of any witness or the cost of any  proofs produced at the direct request of the hearing officer, shall be  borne equally by the parties, unless they agree otherwise, or unless the  hearing officer, in the award, assesses such expenses or any part  thereof against any specified party or parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearing officer's fee. Hearing officers will normally serve  without a fee. In prolonged or special cases the American Arbitration  Association in consultation with the Administrator may determine that  payment of a fee by the parties is appropriate and may establish a  reasonable amount, taking into account the extent of service by the  hearing officer and other relevant circumstances of the case. Any  arrangements for compensation shall be made through the American  Arbitration Association and not directly between the parties and the  hearing officer.</p>
