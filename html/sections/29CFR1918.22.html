                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever practicable, a gangway of not less than 20 inches (.51  m) in width, of adequate strength, maintained in safe repair and safely  secured shall be used. If a gangway is not practicable, a straight  ladder meeting the requirements of Sec. 1918.24 that extends at least  36 inches (.91 m) above the upper landing surface and is secured against  shifting or slipping shall be provided. When conditions are such that  neither a gangway nor straight ladder can be used, a Jacob's ladder  meeting the requirements of Sec. 1918.23 may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each side of the gangway, and the turntable, if used, shall have  a hand rail with a minimum height of 33 inches (.84 m) measured  perpendicularly from rail to walking surfaces at the stanchion, with a  midrail. Rails shall be of wood, pipe, chain, wire, rope or materials of  equivalent strength and shall be kept taut always. Portable stanchions  supporting railings shall be supported or secured to prevent accidental  dislodgement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The gangway shall be kept properly trimmed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a fixed flat tread accommodation ladder is used, and the  angle is low enough to require employees to walk on the edge of the  treads, cleated duckboards shall be laid over and secured to the ladder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When the gangway overhangs the water so that there is danger of  employees falling between the ship and the dock, a net or suitable  protection shall be provided to prevent employees from receiving serious  injury from falls to a lower level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the foot of a gangway is more than one foot (.30 m) away from  the edge of the apron, the space between them shall be bridged by a firm  walkway equipped with a hand rail with a minimum height of approximately  33 inches (.84 m) with midrails on both sides.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Gangways shall be kept clear of supporting bridles and other  obstructions, to provide unobstructed passage. If, because of design,  the gangway bridle cannot be moved to provide unobstructed passage, then  the hazard shall be properly marked to alert employees of the danger.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Obstructions shall not be laid on or across the gangway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Handrails and walking surfaces of gangways shall be maintained  in a safe condition to prevent employees from slipping or falling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Gangways on vessels inspected and certificated by the U.S. Coast  Guard are deemed to meet the requirements of this section.</p>
