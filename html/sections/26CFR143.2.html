                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 4941(d)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1954 as added by section 101(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83  Stat. 500) provides that the term ``self-dealing'' includes any direct  or indirect payment of compensation (or payment or reimbursement of  expenses) by a private foundation to a disqualified person. Section  4941(d)(1)(E) provides that the term ``self-dealing'' includes any  direct or indirect transfer to, or use by, or for the benefit of, a  disqualified person of the income or assets of a private foundation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scholarship and fellowship grants. A scholarship or fellowship  grant to a   person other than a Government official paid or incurred by a private  foundation in accordance with a program which is consistent with the  allowance of a deduction under section 170 for contributions made to  such private foundation shall not constitute an act of self-dealing. For  example, a scholarship or fellowship grant made by a private foundation  in accordance with a program to award scholarship or fellowship grants  to the children of employees of the donor shall not constitute an act of  self-dealing if the private foundation has, after disclosure of the  method of carrying out such program, received a ruling or determination  letter stating that it is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)  and that contributions to the private foundation are deductible by the  donor under section 170.  [T.D. 7030, 35 FR 4293, Mar. 10, 1970]    Sec. Sec. 143.3-143.4  [Reserved]</p>
