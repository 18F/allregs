(1) The chemical substance identified as magnesium potassium titanium oxide (PMN P-01-764; CAS No. 39290-90-9) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified as magnesium potassium titanium oxide (PMN P-01-764; CAS No. 39290-90-9) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.63 (a)(4), (a)(6)(i), (b) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 10-25 meet the minimum requirements for Sec. 721.63(a)(4): Air-purifying, tight-fitting respirator equipped with N100 (if aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters (either half- or

full-face); powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a loose-fitting hood or helmet and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting facepiece (either half- or full-face) and HEPA filters; and supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a hood or helmet or tight-fitting facepiece (either half- or full-face). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the Sec. 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under 40 CFR 721.30. Persons whose Sec. 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.72 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1)(ii), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iv) (use respiratory protection or maintain workplace airborne concentrations at or below an 8-hour time-weighted average of 5 mg/m\3\) and (g)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.80(q).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements. The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recordkeeping. Recordkeeping requirements as specified in Sec. 721.125 (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h), and (i) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations or revocation of certain notification requirements. The provisions of Sec. 721.185 apply to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determining whether a specific use is subject to this section. The provisions of Sec. 721.1725(b)(1) apply to this section.
