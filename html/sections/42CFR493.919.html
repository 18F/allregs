                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of services offered by laboratories. In virology, there  are two types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those that only perform tests that directly detect viral  antigens or structures, either in cells derived from infected tissues or  free in fluid specimens; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Those that are able to isolate and identify viruses and use  direct antigen techniques.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for  proficiency testing in virology, a program must provide a minimum of  five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing  events at approximately equal intervals per year. The samples may be  provided to the laboratory through mailed shipments or, at HHS's option,  may be provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing. An annual  program must include viral species that are the more commonly identified  viruses. The specific organisms found in the samples may vary from year  to year. The annual program must include samples for viral antigen  detection and viral isolation and identification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An approved program must furnish HHS with a description of  samples that it plans to include in its annual program no later than six  months before each calendar year. The program must include other  important emerging viruses (as determined by HHS) and viruses commonly  occurring in patient specimens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An approved program may vary over time. For example, the types  of viruses that might be included in an approved program over time are  the more commonly identified viruses such as Herpes simplex, respiratory  syncytial virus, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and cytomegaloviruses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The program determines the reportable viruses to be detected by  direct antigen techniques or isolated by laboratories that perform viral  isolation procedures. To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's  response, the program must compare the laboratory's response for each  sample with the response that reflects agreement of either 80 percent of  ten or more referee laboratories or 80 percent or more of all  participating laboratories.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To evaluate a laboratory's response for a particular sample, the  program must determine a laboratory's type of service in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section. A laboratory must isolate and identify  the viruses to the same extent it performs these procedures on patient  specimens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Since laboratories may incorrectly report the presence of  viruses in addition to the correctly identified principal virus, the  grading system must provide a means of deducting credit for additional  erroneous viruses reported. Therefore, the total number of correct  responses determined by virus culture techniques submitted by the  laboratory divided by the number of viruses present plus the number of  incorrect viruses reported by the laboratory must be multiplied by 100  to establish a score for each sample in each testing event. For example,  if a sample contained one principal virus and the laboratory reported it  correctly but reported the presence of an additional virus, which was  not present, the sample grade would be 1/(1 + 1) x 100 = 50 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The performance criterion for qualitative antigen tests is  presence or absence of the viral antigen. The score for the antigen  tests is the number of correct responses divided by the number of  samples to be tested for the antigen, multiplied by 100.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The score for a testing event is the average of the sample  scores as determined under paragraph (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.
