                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The application will consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application form provided by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written work plan and other evidence the Agency requires to  demonstrate the feasibility of the intermediary's program to meet the  objectives of this program. The plan must, at a minimum:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Document the intermediary's ability to administer IRP in  accordance with the provisions of this subpart. In order to adequately  demonstrate the ability to administer the program, the intermediary must  provide a complete listing of all personnel responsible for  administering this program along with a statement of their  qualifications and experience. The personnel may be either members or  employees of the intermediary's organization or contract personnel hired  for this purpose. If the personnel are to be contracted for, the  contract between the intermediary and the entity providing such service  will be submitted for Agency review, and the terms of the contract and  its duration must be sufficient to adequately service the Agency loan  through to its ultimate conclusion. If the Agency determines the  personnel lack the necessary expertise to administer the program, the  loan request will not be approved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Document the intermediary's ability to commit financial  resources under the control of the intermediary to the establishment of  IRP. This should include a statement of the sources of non-Agency funds  for administration of the intermediary's operations and financial  assistance for projects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Demonstrate a need for loan funds. As a minimum, the  intermediary should identify a sufficient number of proposed and known  ultimate recipients it has on hand to justify Agency funding of its loan  request, or include well developed targeting criteria for ultimate  recipients consistent with the intermediary's mission and strategy for  IRP, along with supporting statistical or narrative evidence that such  prospective recipients exist in sufficient numbers to justify Agency  funding of the loan request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Include a list of proposed fees and other charges it will  assess the ultimate recipients;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Demonstrate to Agency satisfaction that the intermediary has  secured commitments of significant financial support from public  agencies and private organizations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Provide evidence to Agency satisfaction that the intermediary  has a proven record of obtaining private or philanthropic funds for the  operation of similar programs to IRP;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Include the intermediary's plan (specific loan purposes) for  relending the loan funds. The plan must be of sufficient detail to  provide the Agency with a complete understanding of what the  intermediary will accomplish by lending the funds to the ultimate  recipient and the complete mechanics of how the funds will get from the  intermediary to the ultimate recipient. The service area, eligibility  criteria, loan purposes, fees, rates, terms, collateral requirements,  limits, priorities, application process, method of disposition of   the funds to the ultimate recipient, monitoring of the ultimate  recipient's accomplishments, and reporting requirements by the ultimate  recipient's management are some of the items that must be addressed by  the intermediary's relending plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Provide a set of goals, strategies, and anticipated outcomes  for the intermediary's program. Outcomes should be expressed in  quantitative or observable terms such as jobs created for low income  area residents or self empowerment opportunities funded, and should  relate to the purpose of IRP (see Sec. 4274.301(b)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Provide specific information as to whether and how the  intermediary will ensure that technical assistance is made available to  ultimate recipients and potential ultimate recipients. Describe the  qualifications of the technical assistance providers, the nature of  technical assistance that will be available, and expected and committed  sources of funding for technical assistance. If other than the  intermediary itself, describe the organizations providing such  assistance and the arrangements between such organizations and the  intermediary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Environmental information on a form provided by the Agency for  all projects positively identified as proposed ultimate recipient loans  that are Class I or Class II actions under subpart G of part 1940 of  this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Comments from the State Single Point of Contact, if the State  has elected to review the program under Executive Order 12372;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A pro forma balance sheet at start-up and projected balance  sheets for at least 3 additional years; financial statements for the  last 3 years, or from inception of the operations of the intermediary if  less than 3 years; and projected cash flow and earnings statements for  at least 3 years supported by a list of assumptions showing the basis  for the projections. The projected earnings statement and balance sheet  must include one set of projections that shows the IRP revolving fund  only and a separate set of projections that shows the proposed  intermediary organization's total operations. Also, if principal  repayment on the IRP loan will not be scheduled during the first 3  years, the projections for the IRP revolving fund must extend to include  a year with a full annual installment on the IRP loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A written agreement of the intermediary to the Agency audit  requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An agreement on a form provided by the Agency assuring  compliance with</p><p class="depth3">Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Complete organizational documents, including evidence of  authority to conduct the proposed activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Evidence that the loan is not available at reasonable rates and  terms from private sources or other Federal, State, or local programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Latest audit report, if available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A form provided by the Agency in which the applicant certifies  its understanding of the Federal collection policies for consumer or  commercial debts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A Department of Agriculture form containing a certification  regarding debarment, suspension, and other responsibility matters for  primary covered transactions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A statement on a form provided by the Agency (Appendix B to  Part 418--Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying) regarding lobbying, as  required by 2 CFR part 418.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applications from intermediaries that already have an active IRP  loan may be streamlined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirements of paragraphs (a)(6), (a)(8), and (a)(10) of  this section may be omitted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the new loan would be operated in accordance  with the work plan on file for the previous loan may be submitted in  lieu of a new work plan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The financial information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this  section may be limited to projections for the proposed new IRP revolving  loan fund.
