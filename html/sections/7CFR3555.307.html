                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. Servicers must utilize general procedures available  under this   subpart for servicing borrowers affected by natural disasters, as  supplemented by Rural Development, to minimize delinquencies and avoid  foreclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluating the damage. Servicers are expected to inspect a  security property whenever they have reason to believe the property has  been damaged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special relief measures. The servicer must evaluate on an  individual case basis a mortgage that is (or becomes) seriously  delinquent as the result of the borrower's incurring extraordinary  damages or expenses related to the natural disaster. The servicer should  document its individual mortgage file regarding all servicing actions  taken during this time period. The lender must consider all special  relief alternatives for disaster assistance available to the borrower  prior to suspending collection and foreclosure activities. Servicing  actions suspended as a result of the natural disaster will expire 90  days from the declaration date of the natural disaster, unless otherwise  extended by the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insurance claim settlements. Prior to release of hazard  insurance proceeds because of damage caused by a natural disaster,  servicers must complete a cost and benefit analysis on a case-by-case  basis to determine if the property can be repaired or rebuilt. The  servicer's actions must be based on the status of the mortgage, the  amount of insurance proceeds, and the length of time required repairing  or reconstructing the property, and the market conditions in the area.  If the property will not be repaired or rebuilt, the insurance proceeds  must be applied to the unpaid principal loan balance.    Sec. Sec. 3555.308-3555.349  [Reserved]</p>
