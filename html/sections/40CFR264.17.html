                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator must take precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive waste. This waste must be separated and protected from sources of ignition or reaction including but not limited to: open flames, smoking, cutting and welding, hot surfaces, frictional heat, sparks (static, electrical, or mechanical), spontaneous ignition (e.g., from heat-producing chemical reactions), and radiant heat. While ignitable or reactive waste is being handled, the owner or operator must confine smoking and open flame to specially designated locations. ``No Smoking'' signs must be conspicuously placed wherever there is a hazard from ignitable or reactive waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where specifically required by other sections of this part, the owner or operator of a facility that treats, stores or disposes ignitable or reactive waste, or mixes incompatible waste or incompatible wastes and other materials, must take precautions to prevent reactions which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generate extreme heat or pressure, fire or explosions, or violent reactions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health or the environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Damage the structural integrity of the device or facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Through other like means threaten human health or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When required to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the owner or operator must document that compliance. This documentation may be based on references to published scientific or engineering literature, data from trial tests (e.g., bench scale or pilot scale tests), waste analyses (as specified in Sec. 264.13), or the results of the treatment of similar wastes by similar treatment processes and under similar operating conditions.
