However, if a coverage determination pertains to medical necessity, reasonableness, or appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care, the Medicare administrative contractor, fiscal intermediary, or carrier must use a QIO to make a determination on those issues if a QIO is conducting review in the area and must abide by the QIO's determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether any claim meets coverage requirements of Title XVIII relating to issues other than medical necessity, reasonableness or appropriateness of placement at an acute level of patient care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment. Medicare administrative contractors, fiscal intermediaries, and carriers are not precluded from making payment determinations with regard to coverage determinations made under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Survey, compliance and assistance activities.
