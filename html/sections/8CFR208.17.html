                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grant of deferral of removal. An alien who: has been ordered removed; has been found under Sec. 208.16(c)(3) to be entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture; and is subject to the provisions for mandatory denial of withholding of removal under Sec. 208.16(d)(2) or (d)(3), shall be granted deferral of removal to the country where he or she is more likely than not to be tortured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to alien. (1) After an immigration judge orders an alien described in paragraph (a) of this section removed, the immigration judge shall inform the alien that his or her removal to the country where he or she is more

likely than not to be tortured shall be deferred until such time as the deferral is terminated under this section. The immigration judge shall inform the alien that deferral of removal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After an immigration judge orders an alien described in paragraph (a) of this section removed, the immigration judge shall inform the alien that his or her removal to the country where he or she is more

likely than not to be tortured shall be deferred until such time as the deferral is terminated under this section. The immigration judge shall inform the alien that deferral of removal:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not confer upon the alien any lawful or permanent immigration status in the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Will not necessarily result in the alien being released from the custody of the Service if the alien is subject to such custody;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is effective only until terminated; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is subject to review and termination if the immigration judge determines that it is not likely that the alien would be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred, or if the alien requests that deferral be terminated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The immigration judge shall also inform the alien that removal has been deferred only to the country in which it has been determined that the alien is likely to be tortured, and that the alien may be removed at any time to another country where he or she is not likely to be tortured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Detention of an alien granted deferral of removal under this section. Nothing in this section shall alter the authority of the Service to detain an alien whose removal has been deferred under this section and who is otherwise subject to detention. In the case of such an alien, decisions about the alien's release shall be made according to part 241 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Termination of deferral of removal. (1) At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the INS District Counsel for the District with jurisdiction over an alien whose removal has been deferred under paragraph (a) of this section may file a motion with the Immigration Court having administrative control pursuant to Sec. 3.11 of this chapter to schedule a hearing to consider whether deferral of removal should be terminated. The Service motion shall be granted if it is accompanied by evidence that is relevant to the possibility that the alien would be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred and that was not presented at the previous hearing. The Service motion shall not be subject to the requirements for reopening in Sec. Sec. 3.2 and 3.23 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the INS District Counsel for the District with jurisdiction over an alien whose removal has been deferred under paragraph (a) of this section may file a motion with the Immigration Court having administrative control pursuant to Sec. 3.11 of this chapter to schedule a hearing to consider whether deferral of removal should be terminated.

Such notice shall inform the alien that the alien may supplement the information in his or her initial application for withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture and shall provide that the alien must submit any such supplemental information within 10 calendar days of service of such notice (or 13 calendar days if service of such notice was by mail). At the expiration of this 10 or 13 day period, the Immigration Court shall forward a copy of the original application, and any supplemental information the alien or the Service has submitted, to the Department of State, together with notice to the Department of State of the time, place and date of the termination hearing. At its option, the Department of State may provide comments on the case, according to the provisions of Sec. 208.11 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The immigration judge shall conduct a hearing and make a de novo determination, based on the record of proceeding and initial application in addition to any new evidence submitted by the Service or the alien, as to whether the alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred. This determination shall be made under the standards for eligibility set out in Sec. 208.16(c). The burden is on the alien to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the immigration judge determines that the alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred, the order of deferral shall remain in place. If the immigration judge determines that the alien has not established that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured in the country to which removal has been deferred, the deferral of removal shall be terminated and the alien may be removed to that country. Appeal of the immigration judge's decision shall lie to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination at the request of the alien. (1) At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the alien may make a written request to the Immigration Court having administrative control pursuant to Sec. 3.11 of this chapter to terminate the deferral order. If satisfied on the basis of the written submission that the alien's request is knowing and voluntary, the immigration judge shall terminate the order of deferral and the alien may be removed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the alien may make a written request to the Immigration Court having administrative control pursuant to Sec. 3.11 of this chapter to terminate the deferral order.

At any time while deferral of removal is in effect, the Attorney General may determine whether deferral should be terminated based on diplomatic assurances forwarded by the Secretary of State pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 208.18(c).
