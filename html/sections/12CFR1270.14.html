To the extent  required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a  Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a  security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a  Federal Reserve Bank or a Person may be created and perfected by a  Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest.

The  perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, and priority of a  security interest are governed by that applicable law. A security  interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a  security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects  under that law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and  priority of the security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating  Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation  for such purposes.</p>
