(1) The chemical substance identified generically as HDI biuret, hydroxyethyl methacrylate prepolymer (PMN P-04-834) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance that have been completely reacted (cured).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified generically as HDI biuret, hydroxyethyl methacrylate prepolymer (PMN P-04-834) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the PMN substance that have been completely reacted (cured).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Protection in the workplace. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.63(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (b) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 25 meet the minimum requirements for Sec. 721.63(a)(4): NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting half-face respirator equipped with N100 (if oil aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; NIOSH-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 (if oil aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a loose-fitting hood or helmet and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters; NIOSH-certified powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting facepiece (either half-face or full-face) and HEPA filters; or NIOSH-certified supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a hood or helmet, or tight-fitting facepiece (either half-face or full-face).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i), a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to Sec. 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under Sec. 721.30. Persons whose Sec. 721.30 requests

to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will be required to follow NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding TSCA section 5(e) consent order.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program.
