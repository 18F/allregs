Federal agencies shall approve one request  for an extension period of 15 days or less. In considering whether a  longer or additional extension period is appropriate, the Federal agency  should consider the magnitude and complexity of the information  contained in the consistency determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final Federal agency action shall not be taken sooner than 90  days from the receipt by the State agency of the consistency  determination unless the State concurs or concurrence is presumed,  pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b), with the activity, or unless both  the Federal agency and the State agency agree to an alternative period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State processing fees. The Act does not require Federal agencies  to pay State processing fees. State agencies shall not assess a Federal  agency with a fee to process the Federal agency's consistency  determination unless payment of such fees is required by other federal  law or otherwise agreed to by the Federal agency and allowed by the  Comptroller General of the United States. In no case may a State agency  stay the consistency review period or base its objection on the failure  of a Federal agency to pay a fee.
