                                Sec.  1.46-2  Carryback and carryover of unused credit.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, see 26 CFR 1.46-2 (Rev. as of April 1, 1979).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general. Under section 46(b)(1), unused credit may be carried back and carried over. Carrybacks and carryovers of unused credit are taken into account in determining the amount of credit available and the credit allowed for the taxable years to which they may be carried. In general, the application of the rules of this section to regular and ESOP credits are separate from their application to nonrefundable energy credits. For example, the limitations on carrybacks and carryovers of unused nonrefundable energy credit under section 46(b) (2) and (3), respectively, differ in amount from the limitations on the regular and ESOP credits because the tax liability limitations for those credits differ. See Sec.  1.46-1(h). For a further example, see the special ordering rule in Sec.  1.46-1(m). Section 46(b) does not apply to the refundable energy credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Unused credit. If carryovers and credit earned (as defined in Sec.  1.46-1(c)(1)) exceed the applicable tax liability limitation, the excess attributable to credit earned is an unused credit. The taxable year in which an unused credit arises is referred to as the ``unused credit year''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Taxable years to which unused credit may be carried. An unused credit is a carryback to each of the 3 taxable

years preceding the unused credit year and a carryover to each of the 7 taxable years succeeding the unused credit year. An unused credit must be carried first to the earliest of those 10 taxable years. An unused credit then must be carried to each of the other 9 taxable years (in order of time) to the extent that the unused credit was not absorbed during a prior taxable year because of the limitations under section 46(b) (2) and (3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for pre-1971 years--(1) In general. For unused credit years ending before January 1, 1971, unused credit is allowed a 10-year carryover rather than the 7-year carryover. The principles of paragraph (d) of this section apply to this 10-year carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For unused credit years ending before January 1, 1971, unused credit is allowed a 10-year carryover rather than the 7-year carryover. The principles of paragraph (d) of this section apply to this 10-year carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cross reference. For limitations on the taxable years to which unused credit from pre-1971 credit years may be carried, see paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Limitations on carrybacks. Under the FIFO rule to section 46(a)(1), carryovers and credit earned are applied against the tax liability limitation before carrybacks. Thus, carrybacks to a taxable year may not exceed the amount by which the applicable tax liability limitation for that year exceeds the sum of carryovers to and credit earned for that year. Carrybacks from an unused credit year are applied against tax liability before carrybacks from a later unused credit year. To the extent an unused credit cannot be carried back to a particular preceding taxable year, the unused credit must be carried to the next succeeding taxable year to which it may be carried.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Limitations on carryovers--(1) General rule. Carryovers to a taxable year may not exceed the applicable tax liability limitation for that year. Carryovers from an unused credit year are applied before carryovers from a later unused credit year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Carryovers to a taxable year may not exceed the applicable tax liability limitation for that year. Carryovers from an unused credit year are applied before carryovers from a later unused credit year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception. A 10-year carryover from a pre-1971 unused credit year may, under certain circumstances, be postponed to prevent a later-earned 7-year carryover from expiring. This exception does not extend the 10-year carryover period for pre-1971 unused credit. See section 46(b)(1)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Corporation M is organized on January 1, 1977 and files its income tax return on a calendar year basis.
