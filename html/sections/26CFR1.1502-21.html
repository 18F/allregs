                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Consolidated net operating loss deduction. The consolidated net operating loss deduction (or CNOL deduction) for any consolidated return year is the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the year. The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks consist of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any CNOLs (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) of the consolidated group; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any net operating losses of the members arising in separate return years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to consolidated return and separate return years. Net operating losses of members arising during a consolidated return year are taken into account in determining the group's CNOL under paragraph (e) of this section for that year. Losses taken into account in determining the CNOL may be carried to other taxable years (whether consolidated or separate) only under this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carryovers and carrybacks generally. The net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to a taxable year are determined under the principles of section 172 and this section. Thus, losses permitted to be absorbed in a consolidated return year generally are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they arose, and losses carried from taxable years ending on the same date, and which are available to offset consolidated taxable income for the year, generally are absorbed on a pro rata basis. In addition, the amount of any CNOL absorbed by the group in any year is apportioned among members based on the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of the beginning of the

year. The percentage of the CNOL attributable to a member is determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Additional rules provided under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations also apply. See, e.g., section 382(l)(2)(B) (if losses are carried from the same taxable year, losses subject to limitation under section 382 are absorbed before losses that are not subject to limitation under section 382). See paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, Example 2, for an illustration of pro rata absorption of losses subject to a SRLY limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Carryovers and carrybacks of CNOLs to separate return years--(i) In general. If any CNOL that is attributable to a member may be carried to a separate return year of the member, the amount of the CNOL that is attributable to the member is apportioned to the member (apportioned loss) and carried to the separate return year. If carried back to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried back to an equivalent, or earlier, consolidated return year of the group; if carried over to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried over to an equivalent, or later, consolidated return year of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If any CNOL that is attributable to a member may be carried to a separate return year of the member, the amount of the CNOL that is attributable to the member is apportioned to the member (apportioned loss) and carried to the separate return year. If carried back to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried back to an equivalent, or earlier, consolidated return year of the group; if carried over to a separate return year, the apportioned loss may not be carried over to an equivalent, or later, consolidated return year of the group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules--(A) Year of departure from group. If a corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, net operating loss carryovers attributable to the corporation are first carried to the consolidated return year, then are subject to reduction under section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28 (regarding discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a)), and then are subject to reduction under Sec. 1.1502-36 (regarding transfers of loss shares of subsidiary stock). Only the amount that is neither absorbed by the group in that year nor reduced under section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28 or under Sec. 1.1502-36 may be carried to the corporation's first separate return year. For rules concerning a member departing a subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Year of departure from group. If a corporation ceases to be a member during a consolidated return year, net operating loss carryovers attributable to the corporation are first carried to the consolidated return year, then are subject to reduction under section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28 (regarding discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a)), and then are subject to reduction under Sec. 1.1502-36 (regarding transfers of loss shares of subsidiary stock). Only the amount that is neither absorbed by the group in that year nor reduced under section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28 or under Sec. 1.1502-36 may be carried to the corporation's first separate return year. For rules concerning a member departing a subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Offspring rule. In the case of a member that has been a member continuously since its organization (determined without regard to whether the member is a successor to any other corporation), the CNOL attributable to the member is included in the carrybacks to consolidated return years before the member's existence. If the group did not file a consolidated return for a carryback year, the loss may be carried back to a separate return year of the common parent under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, but only if the common parent was not a member of a different consolidated group or of an affiliated group filing separate returns for the year to which the loss is carried or any subsequent year in the carryback period. Following an acquisition described in Sec. 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3), references to the common parent are to the corporation that was the common parent immediately before the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Equivalent years. Taxable years are equivalent if they bear the same numerical relationship to the consolidated return year in which a CNOL arises, counting forward or backward from the year of the loss. For example, in the case of a member's third taxable year (which was a separate return year) that preceded the consolidated return year in which the loss arose, the equivalent year is the third consolidated return year preceding the consolidated return year in which the loss arose. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section for certain short taxable years that are disregarded in making this determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Operating rules--(A) Amount of CNOL attributable to a member. The amount of a CNOL that is attributable to a member shall equal the product of the CNOL and the percentage of the CNOL attributable to such member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Amount of CNOL attributable to a member. The amount of a CNOL that is attributable to a member shall equal the product of the CNOL and the percentage of the CNOL attributable to such member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Percentage of CNOL attributable to a member--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2) of this section, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to a member shall equal the separate net operating loss of the member for the year of the loss divided by the sum of the separate net operating losses for that year of all members having such losses. For this purpose, the separate net operating loss of a member is determined by computing the CNOL by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss, including the

member's losses and deductions actually absorbed by the group in the taxable year (whether or not absorbed by the member).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rules--(i) Carryback to a separate return year. If a portion of the CNOL attributable to a member for a taxable year is carried back to a separate return year, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of immediately after such portion of the CNOL is carried back shall be recomputed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Carryback to a separate return year. If a portion of the CNOL attributable to a member for a taxable year is carried back to a separate return year, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of immediately after such portion of the CNOL is carried back shall be recomputed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excluded discharge of indebtedness income. If during a taxable year a member realizes discharge of indebtedness income that is excluded from gross income under section 108(a) and such amount reduces any portion of the CNOL attributable to any member pursuant to section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of immediately after the reduction of attributes pursuant to sections 108 and 1017 and Sec. 1.1502-28 shall be recomputed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Departing member. If during a taxable year a member that had a separate net operating loss for the year of the CNOL ceases to be a member, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of the first day of the following consolidated return year shall be recomputed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reduction of attributes for stock loss. If during a taxable year a member does not cease to be a member of the group and any portion of the CNOL attributable to any member is reduced under Sec. 1.1502-36, the percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member as of immediately after the reduction of attributes under Sec. 1.1502-36 shall be recomputed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B)(2)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Recomputed percentage. The recomputed percentage of the CNOL attributable to each member shall equal the unabsorbed CNOL attributable to the member at the time of the recomputation divided by the sum of the unabsorbed CNOL attributable to all of the members at the time of the recomputation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a CNOL that is reduced under section 108 and Sec. 1.1502-28, or under Sec. 1.1502-36, or that is otherwise permanently disallowed or eliminated, shall be treated as absorbed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns, all corporations have calendar taxable years, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, value means fair market value and the adjusted basis of each asset equals its value, all transactions are with unrelated persons, and the application of any limitation or threshold under section 382 is disregarded. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During Year 1, Individual A forms P and T, and they each file a separate return. P forms S on March 15 of Year 2, and P and S file a consolidated return. P acquires all the stock of T from Individual A at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a member of the P group. P's acquisition of T is not an ownership change within the meaning of section 382. P, S, and T sustain a $1,100 CNOL in Year 3 and, under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable $200 to P, $300 to S, and $600 to T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Of the $1,100 CNOL in Year 3, the $500 amount of the CNOL that is attributable to P and S ($200 + $300) may be carried to P's separate return in Year 1. Even though S was not in existence in Year 1, the $300 amount of the CNOL attributable to S may be carried back to P's separate return in Year 1 because S (unlike T) has been a member of the P group since its organization and P is a qualified parent under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the loss may then be carried to the P group's return in Year 2. The $600 amount of the CNOL attributable to T is a net operating loss carryback to T's separate return in Year 1, and if not absorbed in Year 1, then to Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, on June 15 of Year 4, P sells all the stock of T. The P group's consolidated return for Year 4 includes the income of T through June 15. T files a separate return for the period from June 16 through December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $600 of the Year 3 CNOL attributable to T is apportioned to T and is carried back to its separate return in Year 1. To the extent the $600 is not absorbed in T's separate return in Year 1 or Year 2, it is carried to the consolidated return in Year 4 before being carried to T's separate return in Year 4. Any portion of the loss not absorbed in T's Year 1 or Year 2 or in the P group's Year 4 is then carried to T's separate return in Year 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 1, B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, forms T. P acquires all of the stock of T at the beginning of Year 3, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $200 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2, and $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 3 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). At the beginning of Year 4, T forms a subsidiary, Y, in a transaction described in section 351. The P group has a $300 consolidated net operating loss in Year 4, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable entirely to Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Even though Y was not in existence in Year 2, $300, the amount of the consolidated net operating loss attributable to Y, may be carried back to the P group's Year 2 consolidated return under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because Y has been a member of the P group since its organization. To the extent not absorbed in that year, the loss may then be carried to the P group's consolidated return in Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules--(i) Election to relinquish carryback. A group may make an irrevocable election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a CNOL for any consolidated return year. Except as provided in Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B), the election may not be made separately for any member (whether or not it remains a member), and must be made in a separate statement entitled ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(i) TO WAIVE THE ENTIRE CARRYBACK PERIOD PURSUANT TO SECTION 172(b)(3) FOR THE [insert consolidated return year] CNOLs OF THE CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF WHICH [insert name and employer identification number of common parent] IS THE COMMON PARENT.'' The statement must be filed with the group's income tax return for the consolidated return year in which the loss arises. If the consolidated return year in which the loss arises begins before January 1, 2003, the statement making the election must be signed by the common parent. If the consolidated return year in which the loss arises begins after December 31, 2002, the election may be made in an unsigned statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Election to relinquish carryback. A group may make an irrevocable election under section 172(b)(3) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a CNOL for any consolidated return year.

For rules applicable to relinquishing the entire carryback period with respect to losses attributable to insolvent financial institutions, see Sec. 301.6402-7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Acquisition of member from another consolidated group. If one or more members of a consolidated group becomes a member of another consolidated group, the acquiring group may make an irrevocable election to relinquish, with respect to all consolidated net operating losses attributable to the member, the portion of the carryback period for which the corporation was a member of another group, provided that any other corporation joining the acquiring group that was affiliated with the member immediately before it joined the acquiring group is also included in the waiver. This election is not a yearly election and applies to all losses that would otherwise be subject to a carryback to a former group under section 172. The election must be made in a separate statement entitled ``THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B)(2) TO WAIVE THE PRE-[insert first taxable year for which the member (or members) was not a member of another group] CARRYBACK PERIOD FOR THE CNOLs attributable to [insert names and employer identification number of members].'' The statement must be filed with the acquiring consolidated group's original income tax return for the year the corporation (or corporations) became a member. If the year in which the corporation (or corporations) became a member begins before January 1, 2003, the statement must be signed by the common parent and each of the members to which it applies. If the year in which the corporation (or corporations) became a member begins after December 31, 2002, the election may be made in an unsigned statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> [Reserved].

If a member distributes or transfers assets to a corporation that is a member immediately after the distribution or transfer in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the transaction does not cause the distributor or transferor to have a short year within the consolidated return

year of the group in which the transaction occurred that is counted as a separate year for purposes of determining the years to which a net operating loss may be carried.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special status losses.

Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of a member arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. For this purpose--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> SRLY limitation--(i) General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of a member arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. For this purpose--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section (relating to an overlap with section 382), the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks of a member arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group determined by reference to only the member's items of income, gain, deduction, and loss. For this purpose--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Consolidated taxable income is computed without regard to CNOL deductions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Consolidated taxable income takes into account the member's losses and deductions (including capital losses) actually absorbed by the group in consolidated return years (whether or not absorbed by the member);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In computing consolidated taxable income, the consolidated return years of the group include only those years, including the year to which the loss is carried, that the member has been continuously included in the group's consolidated return, but exclude--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For carryovers, any years ending after the year to which the loss is carried; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For carrybacks, any years ending after the year in which the loss arose; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The treatment under Sec. 1.1502-15 of a built-in loss as a hypothetical net operating loss carryover in the year recognized is solely for purposes of determining the limitation under this paragraph (c) with respect to the loss in that year and not for any other purpose. Thus, for purposes of determining consolidated taxable income for any other losses, a built-in loss allowed under this section in the year it arises is taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Losses treated as arising in SRLYs. If a net operating loss carryover or carryback did not arise in a SRLY but is attributable to a built-in loss (as defined under Sec. 1.1502-15), the carryover or carryback is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c) as arising in a SRLY if the built-in loss was not allowed, after application of the SRLY limitation, in the year it arose. For an illustration, see Sec. 1.1502-15(d), Example 5. But see Sec. 1.1502-15(g)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (c)(1) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T, and T sustains a $100 net operating loss that is carried forward. P acquires all the stock of T at the beginning of Year 2, and T becomes a member of the P group. The P group has $300 of consolidated taxable income in Year 2 (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 arose in a SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(2)(iii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, the $100 net operating loss carryover is subject to the SRLY limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The SRLY limitation for Year 2 is consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, or $70. Thus, $70 of the loss is included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 1, except that such consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) for Year 2 is a loss (a CNOL) of $370. Because the SRLY limitation may not exceed the consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only T's items, and such items aggregate to a CNOL, T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is not allowed under the SRLY limitation in Year 2. Moreover, if consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction and by reference to only T's items) did not exceed $370 in Year 3, the carryover would still be restricted under paragraph (c) of this section in Year 3, because the aggregate consolidated taxable income for all consolidated return years of the group computed by reference to only T's items would not be a positive amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, Individual A forms P, and P sustains a $40 net operating loss that is carried forward. P has no income in Year 2. Individual A also owns T which sustains a net operating loss of $50 in Year 2 that is carried forward. P acquires the stock of T from Individual A during Year 3, but T is not a member of the P group for each day of the year. P and T file separate returns and sustain net operating losses of $120 and $60, respectively, for Year 3. The P group files consolidated returns beginning in Year 4. During Year 4, the P group has $160 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). Such consolidated taxable income would be $70 if determined by reference to only T's items. These results are summarized as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Separate   Separate   Separate/  Consolidated</p><p class="depth0">---------------------- affiliated -------------</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Year 1     Year 2     Year 3       Year 4----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P...............................................................     $ (40)         $0     $ (120)           $90T...............................................................          0       (50)        (60)            70</p><p class="depth0">-------------CTI.............................................................  .........  .........  ..........           160----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P's Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 are not SRLYs with respect to the P group. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(2)(i). Thus, P's $40 net operating loss arising in Year 1 and $120 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are not subject to the SRLY limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. Under the principles of section 172, paragraph (b) of this section requires that the loss arising in Year 1 be the first loss absorbed by the P group in Year 4. Absorption of this loss leaves $120 of the group's consolidated taxable income available for offset by other loss carryovers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> T's Year 2 and Year 3 are SRLYs with respect to the P group. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(2)(ii). P's acquisition of T was not an ownership change as defined by section 382(g). Thus, T's $50 net operating loss arising in Year 2 and $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 are subject to the SRLY limitation. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the SRLY limitation for Year 4 is $70, and under paragraph (b) of this section, T's $50 loss from Year 2 must be included under paragraph (a) of this section in the P group's CNOL deduction for Year 4. The absorption of this loss leaves $70 of the group's consolidated taxable income available for offset by other loss carryovers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> P and T each carry over net operating losses to Year 4 from a taxable year ending on the same date (Year 3). The losses carried over from Year 3 total $180. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the losses carried over from Year 3 are absorbed on a pro rata basis, even though one arises in a SRLY and the other does not. However, the group cannot absorb more than $20 of T's $60 net operating loss arising in Year 3 because its $70 SRLY limitation for Year 4 is reduced by T's $50 Year 2 SRLY loss already included in the CNOL deduction for Year 4. Thus, the absorption of Year 3 losses is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Amount of P's Year 3 losses absorbed = $120/($120 + $20) x $70 = $60.</p><p class="depth0">Amount of T's Year 3 losses absorbed = $20/($120 + $20) x $70 = $10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The absorption of $10 of T's Year 3 loss further reduces T's SRLY limitation to $10 ($70 of initial SRLY limitation, reduced by the $60 net operating loss already included in the CNOL deductions for Year 4 under paragraph (a) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> P carries its remaining $60 Year 3 net operating loss and T carries its remaining $50 Year 3 net operating loss over to Year 5. Assume that, in Year 5, the P group has $90 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction). The group's CTI determined by reference to only T's items is a CNOL of $4. For Year 5, the CNOL deduction is $66, which includes $60 of P's Year 3 loss and $6 of T's Year 3 loss (the aggregate consolidated taxable income for Years 4 and 5 determined by reference to T's items, or $66, reduced by T's SRLY losses actually absorbed by the group in Year 4, or $60).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P owns all of the stock of S and T.

T's $30 net operating loss carryback to the P group from Year 4 is not allowed under paragraph (c) of this section to be included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section for Year 1, 2, or 3, because the P group's consolidated taxable income would not be a positive amount if determined by reference to only T's items for all consolidated return years through Year 4 (without regard to the $30 net operating loss). The $30 loss is carried forward to T's Year 5 and succeeding taxable years as provided under the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns P. In Year 1, Individual A forms T by contributing $300 and T sustains a $100 net operating loss. During Year 2, T's assets decline in value by $100. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires

all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the P group in a transaction that does not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). At the time of the acquisition, T has a $100 net unrealized built-in loss, which exceeds the threshold requirements of section 382(h)(3)(B). During Year 3, T recognizes its unrealized loss as a $100 ordinary loss. The members of the P group contribute the following to the consolidated taxable income of the P group for Years 3 and 4 (computed without regard to T's recognition of its unrealized loss and any CNOL deduction under this section):

The amount of the limitation is determined by treating the deduction as a net operating loss carryover from a SRLY. The built-in loss is therefore subject to a $60 SRLY limitation for Year 3. The built-in loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover solely for purposes of determining the extent to which the loss is not allowed by reason of the SRLY limitation, and for all other purposes the loss remains a loss arising in Year 3. Consequently, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $60 allowed under the SRLY limitation is absorbed by the P group before T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 is allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 1.1502-15(a), the $40 balance of the built-in loss that is not allowed in Year 3 because of the SRLY limitation is treated as a $40 net operating loss arising in Year 3 that is subject to the SRLY limitation because, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, Year 3 is treated as a SRLY, and is carried to other years in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. The SRLY limitation for Year 4 is the P group's consolidated taxable income for Year 3 and Year 4 determined by reference to only T's items and without regard to the group's CNOL deductions ($60 + $40), reduced by T's loss actually absorbed by the group in Year 3 ($60).

The group determines its ability to use its capital loss carryover before it determines its ability to use its ordinary loss carryover. Under section 1212, because the group has no Year 2 capital gain, it cannot absorb any capital losses in Year 2. T's Year 1 net capital loss and the group's Year 2 consolidated net capital loss (all of which is attributable to T) are carried over to Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under this section, the aggregate amount of T's $100 net operating loss carryover from Year 1 that may be included in the CNOL deduction of the group for Year 2 may not exceed $60--the amount of the consolidated taxable income computed by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions to the extent actually absorbed (i.e., $60 of T's ordinary income for Year 2). Thus, the group may include $60 of T's ordinary loss carryover from Year 1 in its Year 2 CNOL deduction. T carries over its remaining $40 of its Year 1 loss to Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For Year 3, the group again computes separate SRLY limits for each of T's SRLY carryovers from Year 1. The group has consolidated net capital gain (without taking into account a net capital loss carryover deduction) of $30. Under Sec. 1.1502-22(c), the aggregate amount of T's $50 capital loss carryover from Year 1 that may be included in computing the group's consolidated net capital gain for all years of the group (here Years 2 and 3) may not exceed $30 (the aggregate consolidated net capital gain computed by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions actually absorbed (i.e., $30 of capital gain in Year 3)). Thus, the group may include $30 of T's Year 1 capital loss carryover in its computation of consolidated net capital gain for Year 3, which offsets the group's capital gains for Year 3. T carries over its remaining $20 of its Year 1 loss to Year 4. The group carries over the

Year 2 consolidated net capital loss to Year 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under this section, the aggregate amount of T's net operating loss carryover from Year 1 that may be included in the CNOL deduction of the group for Years 2 and 3 may not exceed $100, which is the amount of the aggregate consolidated taxable income for Years 2 and 3 determined by reference only to T's items, including losses and deductions actually absorbed (i.e., $60 of ordinary income in Year 2 plus $40 of ordinary income, $30 of capital gain, and $30 of SRLY capital losses actually absorbed in Year 3). The group included $60 of T's ordinary loss carryover in its Year 2 CNOL deduction. It may include the remaining $40 of the carryover in its Year 3 CNOL deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> SRLY subgroup limitation. In the case of a net operating loss carryover or carryback for which there is a SRLY subgroup, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to the SRLY subgroup, and not separately to its members. Thus, the contribution to consolidated taxable income and the net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks arising (or treated as arising) in SRLYs that are included in the CNOL deductions for all consolidated return years of the group under paragraph (a) of this section are based on the aggregate amounts of income, gain, deduction, and loss of the members of the SRLY subgroup for the relevant consolidated return years (as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section). For an illustration of aggregate amounts during the relevant consolidated return years following the year in which a member of a SRLY subgroup ceases to be a member of the group, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii) Example 4 of this section. A SRLY subgroup may exist only for a carryover or carryback arising in a year that is not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) with respect to another group (the former group), whether or not the group is a consolidated group, or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group). A separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each such carryover or carryback. A consolidated group may include more than one SRLY subgroup, and a member may be a member of more than one SRLY subgroup. Solely for purposes of determining the members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to a loss:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Carryovers. In the case of a carryover, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member carrying over the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was a member of the former group that becomes a member of the group at the same time as the loss member. A member remains a member of the SRLY subgroup until it ceases to be affiliated with the loss member. The aggregate determination described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and this paragraph (c)(2) includes the amounts of income, gain, deduction, and loss of each member of the SRLY subgroup for the consolidated return years during which it remains a member of the SRLY subgroup. For an illustration of the aggregate determination of a SRLY subgroup, see paragraph (c)(2)(viii) Example 2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carrybacks. In the case of a carryback, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member carrying back the loss (the loss member) and each other member of the group from which the loss is carried back that has been continuously affiliated with the loss member from the year to which the loss is carried through the year in which the loss arises.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Built-in losses. In the case of a built-in loss, the SRLY subgroup is composed of the member recognizing the loss (the loss member) and each other member that was part of the subgroup with respect to the loss determined under Sec. 1.1502-15(c)(2) immediately before the members became members of the group. The principles of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to determine the SRLY subgroup for the built-in loss that is, under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, treated as arising in a SRLY with respect to the group in which the loss is recognized. For this purpose and as the context requires, a reference in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to a group or former group is a reference to the subgroup determined under Sec. 1.1502-15(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Principal purpose of avoiding or increasing a SRLY limitation. The members composing a SRLY subgroup are not treated as a SRLY subgroup if any of them is formed, acquired, or availed

of with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of, or increasing any limitation under, this paragraph (c). Any member excluded from a SRLY subgroup, if excluded with a principal purpose of so avoiding or increasing any SRLY limitation, is treated as included in the SRLY subgroup.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Coordination with other limitations. This paragraph (c)(2) does not allow a net operating loss to offset income to the extent inconsistent with other limitations or restrictions on the use of losses, such as a limitation based on the nature or activities of members. For example, any dual consolidated loss may not reduce the taxable income to an extent greater than that allowed under section 1503(d) and Secs. 1.1503(d)-1 through 1.1503(d)-8. See also Sec. 1.1502-47(q) (relating to preemption of rules for life-nonlife groups).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Anti-duplication. If the same item of income or deduction could be taken into account more than once in determining a limitation under this paragraph (c), or in a manner inconsistent with any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations incorporating this paragraph (c), the item of income or deduction is taken into account only once and in such manner that losses are absorbed in accordance with the ordering rules in paragraph (b) of this section and the underlying purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Corporations that leave a SRLY subgroup. If a loss member ceases to be affiliated with a SRLY subgroup, the amount of the member's remaining SRLY loss from a specific year is determined pursuant to the principles of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (c)(2) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of P, S, T and M. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. During Year 1, P sustains a $50 net operating loss. At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S at a time when the aggregate basis of S's assets exceeds their aggregate value by $70, and S becomes a member of the P group. At the beginning of Year 3, P acquires all the stock of T, T has a $60 net operating loss carryover at the time of the acquisition, and T becomes a member of the P group. During Year 4, S forms S1 and T forms T1, each by contributing assets with built-in gains which are, in the aggregate, material. S1 and T1 become members of the P group. During Year 7, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the members of the P group become members of the M group for the balance of Year 7. The $50 and $60 loss carryovers of P and T are carried to Year 7 of the M group, and the value and basis of S's assets did not change after it became a member of the former P group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a separate SRLY subgroup is determined for each loss carryover and built-in loss. In the P group, P's $50 loss carryover is not treated as arising in a SRLY. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f). Consequently, the carryover is not subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section in the P group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the M group, P's $50 loss carryover is treated as arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. A SRLY subgroup with respect to that loss is composed of members which were members of the P group, the group as to which the loss was not a SRLY. The SRLY subgroup is composed of P, the member carrying over the loss, and each other member of the P group that became a member of the M group at the same time as P. A member of the SRLY subgroup remains a member until it ceases to be affiliated with P. For Year 7, the SRLY subgroup is composed of P, S, T, S1, and T1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the P group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the P group, is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. See Sec. 1.1502-15 and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Because S was not continuously affiliated with P, T, or T1 for 60 consecutive months prior to joining the P group, these corporations cannot be included in a SRLY subgroup with respect to S's unrealized loss in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. As a successor to S, S1 is included in a subgroup with S in the P group, and, because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be offset by the built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> In the M group, S's $70 unrealized loss, if recognized within the 5-year recognition period after S becomes a member of the M group, is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. Prior to becoming a member of the M group, S had been continuously affiliated with P (but not T or T1) for 60 consecutive months, and S1 is a successor

that has remained continuously affiliated with S. Those members had a net unrealized built-in loss immediately before they became members of the group under Sec. 1.1502-15(c). Consequently, in Year 7, S, S1, and P compose a subgroup in the M group with respect to S's unrealized loss. Because S1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of S1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the recognized built-in loss. See paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In the P group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. P, S, and S1 were not members of the group in which T's loss arose, and T's loss carryover was not subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section with respect to the P group (the former group). Thus, P, S, and S1 are not members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the T carryover in the P group. See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. As a successor to T, T1 is included in a SRLY subgroup with T in the P group, and, because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the P group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the P group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> In the M group, T's $60 loss carryover arose in a SRLY and is subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. T and T1 remain the only members of a SRLY subgroup with respect to the carryover. Because T1 was a member of the SRLY subgroup when it became a member of the M group and also because 100 percent of T1's stock is owned directly by corporations that were members of the SRLY subgroup when the members of the SRLY subgroup became members of the M group, its net positive income is not excluded from the consolidated taxable income of the M group that may be offset by the carryover. See paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M. P and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S and T from Individual A, and S and T become members of the P group. For Year 3, the P group has a $45 CNOL, which is attributable to P, and which P carries forward. M is the common parent of another group. At the beginning of Year 4, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P's year to which the loss is attributable, Year 3, is a SRLY with respect to the M group. See Sec. 1.1502-1(f)(1). However, P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to the Year 3 loss under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section because Year 3 is not a SRLY (and is not treated as a SRLY) with respect to the P group. P's loss is carried over to the M group's Year 4 and is therefore subject to the SRLY subgroup limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In Year 4, the M group has $10 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 4). Such consolidated taxable income would be $45 if determined by reference to only the items of P, S, and T, the members included in the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's loss carryover. Therefore, the SRLY subgroup limitation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for P's net operating loss carryover from Year 3 is $45. Because the M group has only $10 of consolidated taxable income in Year 4, however, only $10 of P's net operating loss carryover is included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In Year 5, the M group has $100 of consolidated taxable income (computed without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 5). Neither P, S, nor T has any items of income, gain, deduction, or loss in Year 5. Although the members of the SRLY subgroup do not contribute to the $100 of consolidated taxable income in Year 5, the SRLY subgroup limitation for Year 5 is $35 (the sum of SRLY subgroup consolidated taxable income of $45 in Year 4 and $0 in Year 5, less the $10 net operating loss carryover actually absorbed by the M group in Year 4). Therefore, $35 of P's net operating loss carryover is included in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of S, T, P and M. S, P, and M are each the common parent of a consolidated group. At the beginning of Year 1, S acquires all the stock of T from Individual A, and T becomes a member of the S group. For Year 1, the S group has a CNOL of $10, all of which is attributable to S and is carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of Year 2, P acquires all the stock of S, and S and T become members of the P group. For Year 2, the P group has a CNOL of $35, all of which is attributable to P and is carried over to Year 3. At the beginning of Year 3, M acquires all of the stock of P, and the former members of the P group become members of the M group. None of the transactions described above resulted in an ownership change under section 382(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P's and S's net operating losses arising in SRLYs with respect to the M group are

subject to limitation under paragraph (c) of this section. P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for P's $35 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 2 because, under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, Year 2 is not a SRLY with respect to the P group. Similarly, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup for purposes of determining the limitation for S's $10 net operating loss carryover arising in Year 1 because Year 1 is not a SRLY with respect to the S group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S and T are members of both the SRLY subgroup with respect to P's losses and the SRLY subgroup with respect to S's losses. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, S's and T's items cannot be included in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for both SRLY subgroups for the same consolidated return year; paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section requires the M group to consider the items of S and T only once so that the losses are absorbed in the order of the taxable years in which they were sustained. Because S's loss was incurred in Year 1, while P's loss was incurred in Year 2, the items will be added in the determination of the consolidated taxable income of the S and T SRLY subgroup to enable S's loss to be absorbed first. The taxable income of the P, S, and T SRLY subgroup is then computed by including the consolidated taxable income for the S and T SRLY subgroup less the amount of any net operating loss carryover of S that is absorbed after applying this section to the S subgroup for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of P, and M. P and S are members of the P group and the P group has a CNOL of $30 in Year 1, all of which is attributable to P and carried over to Year 2. At the beginning of Year 2, M acquires all of the stock of P, and P and S become members of the M group. P and S compose a SRLY subgroup with respect to P's net operating loss carryover. For Year 2, consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to only the items of P (and without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 2) is $40. However, such consolidated taxable income of the M group determined by reference to the items of both P and S is a loss of $20. Thus, the SRLY subgroup limitation under paragraph (c)(2) of this section prevents the M group from including any of P's net operating loss carryover in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section in Year 2, and P carries the Year 1 loss to Year 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the end of Year 2, P sells all of the S stock, and S ceases to be a member of the M group and the P subgroup. For Year 3, consolidated taxable income of the M group is $50 (determined without regard to the CNOL deduction for Year 3), and such consolidated taxable income would be $10 if determined by reference to only items of P. However, the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section for Year 3 for P's net operating loss carryover still prevents the M group from including any of P's loss in the CNOL deduction under paragraph (a) of this section. The limitation results from the inclusion of S's items for Year 2 in the determination of the SRLY subgroup limitation for Year 3 even though S ceased to be a member of the M group (and the P subgroup) at the end of Year 2. Thus, the M group's consolidated taxable income determined by reference to only the SRLY subgroup members' items for all consolidated return years of the group through Year 3 (determined without regard to the CNOL deduction) is not a positive amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Application to other than loss carryovers. Paragraph (g) of this section and the phrase ``or for a carryover that was subject to the overlap rule described in paragraph (g) of this section or Sec. 1.1502-15(g) with respect to another group (the former group)'' in this paragraph (c)(2) apply only to carryovers of net operating losses, net capital losses, and for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, to carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2). Accordingly, as the context may require, if another regulation references this section and such other regulation does not concern a carryover of net operating losses, net capital losses, or for taxable years for which the due date (without extensions) of the consolidated return is after May 25, 2000, carryovers of credits described in section 383(a)(2), then such reference does not include a reference to such paragraph or phrase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Coordination with consolidated return change of ownership limitation and transactions subject to old section 382--(1) Consolidated return changes of ownership.

Because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are coextensive, under paragraph (g) of this section, the SRLY limitation does not apply to the Year 2 $200 net operating loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual B owns all of the stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. P owns all of the stock of S and all of the stock of T. Individual A owns all of the stock of X, the common parent of another consolidated group. In Year 1, the P group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss, of which $100 is attributable to S and $100 is attributable to T. At the beginning of Year 3, the X group acquires all of the stock of S and T from P and does not make an election under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(4) (concerning an election to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as having been satisfied).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X's acquisition of S and T results in S and T becoming members of the X group (the SRLY event). With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S and T do not bear (and are not treated as bearing) a section 1504(a)(1) relationship. Therefore S and T do not qualify as a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1). X's acquisition of S and T results in separate ownership changes of S and T, that give rise to separate limitations under section 382(a) (the section 382 events) with respect to each of S and T's Year 1 net operating loss carryovers. See Sec. 1.1502-94.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The SRLY event and the change dates of the section 382 events occur on the same date. However, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply because the SRLY subgroup (composed of S and T) is not coextensive with a loss subgroup with respect to the Year 1 carryovers. Consequently, the Year 1 net operating loss is subject to both a SRLY subgroup limitation and also separate section 382 limitations for each of S and T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of T and all of the stock of S, the common parent of a consolidated group.

The acquisition, however, did not result in an ownership change under section 382(g). As a result, T's Year 1 net operating loss is subject to SRLY within the S group. At the end of Year 7, Sec. 1.1502-96(a) treats T's Year 1 net operating loss as not having arisen in a SRLY with respect to the S group. Section 1.1502-96(a), however, applies only for purposes of Secs. 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and Sec. 1.1502-98 but not for purposes of this section. See Sec. 1.1502-96(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> P's acquisition of S in Year 8 results in S and T becoming members of the P group (the SRLY event).

P's acquisition of S results in an ownership change of the loss subgroup, within the meaning of section 382(g), that gives rise to a subgroup limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to that carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date. However, under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, because the SRLY subgroup and the loss subgroup are not coextensive, T's Year 1 net operating loss carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss carryover, S and T compose both a SRLY subgroup and a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1).

B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of D. In Year 1, D incurs a $100 net operating loss that is carried

forward. At the beginning of Year 3, R acquires all of the stock of D. In Year 5, M acquires all of the stock of R in a transaction that did not result in an ownership change of R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> R's Year 3 acquisition of D results in D becoming a member of the R group (the SRLY event) and also results in an ownership change of D, that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a) (the section 382 event) with respect to D's net operating loss carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because the SRLY event and the change date of the section 382 event occur on the same date, there is an overlap of the application of paragraph (c) of this section and section 382 with respect to D's net operating loss. Consequently, under this paragraph (g), D's Year 1 $100 net operating loss is not subject to a SRLY limitation in the R group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> M's Year 5 acquisition of R results in R and D becoming members of the M group (the SRLY event), but does not result in an ownership change of R or D that gives rise to a limitation under section 382(a). Because there is no section 382 event, the application of the SRLY rules and section 382 do not overlap. Consequently, D's Year 1 $100 net operating loss is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Because D's Year 1 net operating loss carryover was subject to the overlap rule of paragraph (g) of this section when it joined the R group, under Sec. 1.1502-21(c)(2), the SRLY subgroup with respect to that carryover includes all of the members of the R group that joined the M group at the same time as D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all of the stock of P and S, each the common parent of a consolidated group. S owns all of the stock of T, its only subsidiary. B, an individual unrelated to Individual A, owns all of the stock of M, the common parent of a consolidated group. In Year 1, the S group has a $100 consolidated net operating loss. On January 1 of Year 2, P acquires all of the stock of S from Individual A. On December 31 of Year 2, M acquires 51% of the stock of P from Individual A. On May 31 of Year 3, M acquires the remaining 49% of the stock of P from Individual A. The P group, for the Year 3 period prior to June 1, had a $50 consolidated net operating loss, and under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, the loss is attributable entirely to S. Other than the losses described above, the P group does not have any other consolidated net operating losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the P group, S's $100 loss carryover is treated as arising in a SRLY and is subject to the limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.

The purchase, however, does not result in an ownership change of P because it is not a loss corporation under section 382(k)(1). M's May 31 purchase of 49% of P results in P, S, and T becoming members of the M group and is therefore a SRLY event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to the Year 1 net operating loss, S and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and a loss subgroup under Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1). The loss subgroup does not include P because the only loss at the time of the section 382 event was subject to SRLY with respect to the P group. See Sec. 1.1502-91(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Because the SRLY event occured within six months of the change date of the section 382 event and the SRLY subgroup and loss subgroup are coextensive with respect to the Year 1 net operating loss carryover, there is an overlap of the application of the SRLY rules and the application of section 382 within the meaning of paragraph (g) of this section. Thus, the SRLY limitation does not apply to that carryover.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The Year 3 net operating loss, which arose between the section 382 event and the SRLY event, is a net operating loss described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section because it is the net operating loss of a corporation whose SRLY event occurs within the six month period beginning on the date of a section 382 event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> With respect to the Year 3 net operating loss, P, S, and T compose a SRLY subgroup under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Because P, a member of the SRLY subgroup for the Year 3 carryover, is not also a member of a SRLY subgroup that has net operating loss carryovers described in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the Year 1 net operating loss), the Year 3 carryover is subject to a SRLY limitation in the M group.

For purposes of computing the limitation under section 172(b)(1)(H)(iv) on a Five-Year Carryback to any consolidated return year from any consolidated return year or separate return year, taxpayer's taxable income as used in section 172(b)(1)(H)(iv)(I) means consolidated taxable income (CTI) in the consolidated return year that is the fifth taxable year preceding the year of the loss. For purposes of the preceding sentence, CTI is computed without regard to any CNOL deduction attributable to the particular Five-Year Carryback or any NOL from any member's taxable year ending on the same date as the taxable year in which the Five-Year Carryback arises, or any taxable year thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Limitation on Five-Year Carrybacks to a consolidated group--(1) Annual limitation.

This paragraph (b)(3)(v) does not apply to any loss of an eligible small business as defined in section 172(b)(1)(H)(v)(II) with respect to any election made pursuant to section 172(b)(1)(H) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (b)(3)(v) are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of the examples, all affiliated groups file consolidated returns, all corporations are includible corporations that have calendar taxable years, the facts set forth the only relevant corporate activity, and all transactions are with unrelated parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P is the common parent of the P Group. On June 30, 2006, P acquired all of the stock of T from X, the common parent of the X Group. The X Group has been in existence since 1996. P did not make the election described in Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) to relinquish, with respect to all CNOLs attributable to T, the portion of the carryback period for which T was a member of the X Group. In 2008, the P Group sustained a $1,000 CNOL, $600 of which was attributable to T under Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv)(A).

P elected a Five-Year Carryback pursuant to section 172(b)(1)(H) with regard to the P Group's 2008 CNOL. P did not make an election pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section to waive any portion of the period during which T was included in the X Group. T's fifth taxable year preceding the year of the loss was the X Group's 2004 consolidated return year. For 2004, T's separate return limitation year (SRLY) limitation for losses carried into the X Group was $400. The X Group's CTI for 2004 is $200. The X Group did not make a Five-Year Carryback election for a CNOL from its 2008 or 2009 taxable year. There are no other NOL carrybacks into the X Group's 2004 consolidated taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Five-Year Carryback from separate return year. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(C)(1) of this section, the amount of T's apportioned loss that is eligible for Five-Year Carryback is limited to 50 percent of the X Group's CTI for 2004, or $100 ($200 x 50 percent). Therefore, $100 of T's apportioned loss will be carried into the X Group's 2004 consolidated return year. In addition, T's 2008 loss is subject to the SRLY limitation of $400 with respect to the X Group. Thus, the amount of T's portion of the P Group's 2008 CNOL that may offset the X Group's 2004 CTI is $100 (the lesser of $400 (T's SRLY limitation) or $100 (the amount of T's Five-Year Carryback)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pro rata absorption of limited and non-limited losses within a single consolidated return year. The facts are the same as in paragraph (i), except that the X Group sustained a $750 CNOL in 2008, which X elected to carry back four years to its 2004 consolidated return year (no Five-Year Carryback). Further, the X Group had CTI of $500 in 2004. Therefore, the X Group and the P Group both carry back CNOLs from years ending December 31, 2008, although only the P Group's CNOL (including the portion allocable to T) constitutes a Five-Year Carryback. The Annual Limitation on Five-Year Carrybacks will be $250 ($500 x 50 percent), with CTI determined without taking into account the portion of P's 2008 CNOL carried back to the X Group's 2004 consolidated return year or the X Group's 2008 CNOL, which arises from a taxable year ending on the same date as the Five-Year Carryback. The $750 CNOL carryback within the X Group is subject to no limitation. Under Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(1), because the 2008 CNOL of the X Group and the 2008 SRLY loss of T are losses from years ending on the same date and are available to offset CTI in the same year, the two losses offset the X Group's $500 CTI on a pro rata basis. Accordingly, $375 of the X's Group's 2008 CNOL [$500 x $750/($750 + $250)] and $125 of T's portion of the P Group's 2008 CNOL [$500 x $250/($750 + $250)] offset the X Group's 2004 CTI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On January 1, 2004, Individual A formed X, which formed corporations S and T, and X elected to file a consolidated Federal income tax return. For its 2004 consolidated taxable year, the X Group's CTI was $1,100. For its 2005 consolidated taxable year, the X Group's CTI was $1,000. On June 30, 2007, the X Group sold all of the S stock to the Y Group and sold all of the T stock to the Z Group. The X Group terminated in 2007. Neither Y nor Z made the election described in Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) to relinquish, with respect to all CNOLs attributable to S and T, respectively, the portion of the carryback period for which S and T were members of the X Group. In 2008, the Y Group sustained an $800 CNOL, $400 of which was attributable to S under Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv)(A). Y elected a Five-Year Carryback with regard to the Y Group's 2008 CNOL pursuant to section 172(b)(1)(H). Y did not make an election pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section to waive any portion of the period during which S was included in the X Group. In 2009, the Z Group sustained a $1,000 CNOL, $600 of which was attributable to T under Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv)(A). Z elected a Five-Year Carryback with regard to the Z Group's 2009 CNOL pursuant to section 172(b)(1)(H). Z did not make an election pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section to waive any portion of the Extended Carryback Period during which T was included in the X Group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The $400 of Y Group's 2008 CNOL that is apportioned to S is carried back as a separate return year Five-Year Carryback to the X Group's 2004 consolidated return year. The $600 of Z Group's 2009 CNOL that is apportioned to T is also a separate return year Five-Year Carryback to the X Group's 2005 consolidated return year. The Annual Limitation on Five-Year Carryback to the X Group's 2004 consolidated return year computed under paragraph (b)(3)(v)(C)(1) of this section equals $550 ($1,100 of CTI x 50 percent). Because S is making the sole Five-Year Carryback to the X Group's 2004 consolidated return year, S will make a Five-Year Carryback of the full $400. Similarly, the Annual Limitation for Five-Year Carryback to the X Group's 2005 consolidated return year computed under paragraph (b)(3)(v)(C)(1) of this section equals $500 ($1,000 of CTI x 50 percent). Because T is making the sole Five-Year Carryback to the X Group's 2005 consolidated return year, T will make a Five-Year Carryback of the full $500. The SRLY limitations for S and T, respectively, may limit the absorption of the Five-Year Carrybacks within the X Group.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Pre-acquisition election by T. P is the common parent of the P Group. On December 31, 2008, P acquired all of the stock of T from X, the common parent of the X Group. T had been a member of the X Group since 1999. P did not make the election described in Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) to relinquish,

with respect to all CNOLs attributable to T, the portion of the carryback period for which T was a member of the X Group. Pursuant to section 172(b)(1)(H), the X Group elected to make a Five-Year Carryback of its 2008 CNOL back to 2003. A portion of this CNOL is attributable to T pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv)(A). In 2009, the P Group incurred a CNOL of $1,000, $600 of which is attributable to T pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv)(A). Pursuant to section 172(b)(1)(H), the P Group elected a Five-Year Carryback with regard to its 2009 CNOL. P did not make the election pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section to waive any portion of the period during which T was included in the X Group. The Five-Year Carryback election by the X Group with respect to its 2008 CNOL (which includes the portion of the CNOL attributable to T) does not disqualify the P Group from electing a Five-Year Carryback with regard to its 2009 CNOL. Therefore, the P Group may carry back its CNOL, including the portion attributable to T, in accordance with Sec. 1.1502-21 and the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)-(h)(8)</em> [Reserved] For further guidance, see Sec. 1.1502-21(c) through (h)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Section 172(b)(1)(H)--(i) Applicability date.
