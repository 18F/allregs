When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for Sec. 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent or reduce exposure, where feasible. A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified air-purifying, tight-fitting full-face respirator equipped with N100 filters with an assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50 meet the minimum requirements of Sec. 721.63(a)(4).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.
