                                Sec.  1.21-1  Expenses for household and dependent care services necessary
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 21 allows a credit to a taxpayer against  the tax imposed by chapter 1 for employment-related expenses for  household services and care (as defined in paragraph (d) of this  section) of a qualifying individual (as defined in paragraph (b) of this  section). The purpose of the expenses must be to enable the taxpayer to  be gainfully employed (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section). For  taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, a qualifying individual  must have the same principal place of abode (as defined in paragraph (g)  of this section) as the taxpayer for more than one-half of the taxable  year. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005, the taxpayer  must maintain a household (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section)  that includes one or more qualifying individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of the credit is equal to the applicable percentage  of the employment-related expenses that may be taken into account by the  taxpayer during the taxable year (but subject to   the limits prescribed in Sec.  1.21-2). Applicable percentage means 35  percent reduced by 1 percentage point for each $2,000 (or fraction  thereof) by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable  year exceeds $15,000, but not less than 20 percent. For example, if a  taxpayer's adjusted gross income is $31,850, the applicable percentage  is 26 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expenses may be taken as a credit under section 21, regardless  of the taxpayer's method of accounting, only in the taxable year the  services are performed or the taxable year the expenses are paid,  whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The requirements of section 21 and Sec. Sec.  1.21-1 through  1.21-4 are applied at the time the services are performed, regardless of  when the expenses are paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (a) are illustrated  by the following examples.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. In December 2007, B pays for the care of her child for  January 2008. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, B may claim the  credit in 2008, the later of the years in which the expenses are paid  and the services are performed.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that B's  child turns 13 on February 1, 2008, and B pays for the care provided in  January 2008 on February 3, 2008. Under paragraph (a)(4) of this  section, the determination of whether the expenses are employment- related expenses is made when the services are performed. Assuming other  requirements are met, the amount B pays will be an employment-related  expense under section 21, because B's child is a qualifying individual  when the services are performed, even though the child is not a  qualifying individual when B pays the expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying individual--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For taxable years  beginning after December 31, 2004, a qualifying individual is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's dependent (who is a qualifying child within the  meaning of section 152) who has not attained age 13;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's dependent (as defined in section 152, determined  without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B)) who is  physically or mentally incapable of self-care and who has the same  principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one-half of the  taxable year; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer's spouse who is physically or mentally incapable  of self-care and who has the same principal place of abode as the  taxpayer for more than one-half of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005. For taxable  years beginning before January 1, 2005, a qualifying individual is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer's dependent for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a  deduction for a personal exemption under section 151(c) and who is under  age 13;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's dependent who is physically or mentally  incapable of self-care; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The taxpayer's spouse who is physically or mentally incapable  of self-care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Qualification on a daily basis. The status of an individual as a  qualifying individual is determined on a daily basis. An individual is  not a qualifying individual on the day the status terminates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Physical or mental incapacity. An individual is physically or  mentally incapable of self-care if, as a result of a physical or mental  defect, the individual is incapable of caring for the individual's  hygiene or nutritional needs, or requires full-time attention of another  person for the individual's own safety or the safety of others. The  inability of an individual to engage in any substantial gainful activity  or to perform the normal household functions of a homemaker or care for  minor children by reason of a physical or mental condition does not of  itself establish that the individual is physically or mentally incapable  of self-care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special test for divorced or separated parents or parents living  apart--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Scope. This paragraph (b)(5) applies to a child (as defined  in section 152(f)(1) for taxable years beginning after December 31,  2004, and in section 151(c)(3) for taxable years beginning before  January 1, 2005) who--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Is under age 13 or is physically or mentally incapable of self- care;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Receives over one-half of his or her support during the calendar  year from one or both parents who are divorced or legally separated  under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, are separated under a  written   separation agreement, or live apart at all times during the last 6  months of the calendar year; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Is in the custody of one or both parents for more than one-half  of the calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Custodial parent allowed the credit. A child to whom this  paragraph (b)(5) applies is the qualifying individual of only one parent  in any taxable year and is the qualifying child of the custodial parent  even if the noncustodial parent may claim the dependency exemption for  that child for that taxable year. See section 21(e)(5). The custodial  parent is the parent having custody for the greater portion of the  calendar year. See section 152(e)(4)(A).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth3">Example. C pays $420 for the care of her child, a qualifying  individual, to be provided from January 2 through January 31, 2008 (21  days of care). On January 20, 2008, C's child turns 13 years old. Under  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, C's child is a qualifying individual  from January 2 through January 19, 2008 (13 days of care). C may take  into account $260, the pro rata amount C pays for the care of her child  for 13 days, under section 21. See Sec.  1.21-2(a)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Gainful employment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Expenses are employment- related expenses only if they are for the purpose of enabling the  taxpayer to be gainfully employed. The expenses must be for the care of  a qualifying individual or household services performed during periods  in which the taxpayer is gainfully employed or is in active search of  gainful employment. Employment may consist of service within or outside  the taxpayer's home and includes self-employment. An expense is not  employment-related merely because it is paid or incurred while the  taxpayer is gainfully employed. The purpose of the expense must be to  enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed. Whether the purpose of an  expense is to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed depends on  the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Work as a volunteer  or for a nominal consideration is not gainful employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination of period of employment on a daily basis--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  general. Expenses paid for a period during only part of which the  taxpayer is gainfully employed or in active search of gainful employment  must be allocated on a daily basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for short, temporary absences. A taxpayer who is  gainfully employed is not required to allocate expenses during a short,  temporary absence from work, such as for vacation or minor illness,  provided that the care-giving arrangement requires the taxpayer to pay  for care during the absence. An absence of 2 consecutive calendar weeks  is a short, temporary absence. Whether an absence longer than 2  consecutive calendar weeks is a short, temporary absence is determined  based on all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Part-time employment. A taxpayer who is employed part-time  generally must allocate expenses for dependent care between days worked  and days not worked. However, if a taxpayer employed part-time is  required to pay for dependent care on a periodic basis (such as weekly  or monthly) that includes both days worked and days not worked, the  taxpayer is not required to allocate the expenses. A day on which the  taxpayer works at least 1 hour is a day of work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. D works during the day and her husband, E, works at night  and sleeps during the day. D and E pay for care for a qualifying  individual during the hours when D is working and E is sleeping. Under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the amount paid by D and E for care  may be for the purpose of allowing D and E to be gainfully employed and  may be an employment-related expense under section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. F works at night and pays for care for a qualifying  individual during the hours when F is working. Under paragraph (c)(1) of  this section, the amount paid by F for care may be for the purpose of  allowing F to be gainfully employed and may be an employment-related  expense under section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. G, the custodial parent of two children who are  qualifying individuals, hires a housekeeper for a monthly salary to care  for the children while G is gainfully employed. G becomes ill and as a  result is absent from work for 4 months. G continues to pay the  housekeeper to care for the children while G is absent from work. During  this 4-month period, G performs no employment   services, but receives payments under her employer's wage continuation  plan. Although G may be considered to be gainfully employed during her  absence from work, the absence is not a short, temporary absence within  the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and her payments  for household and dependent care services during the period of illness  are not for the purpose of enabling her to be gainfully employed. G's  expenses are not employment-related expenses, and she may not take the  expenses into account under section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. To be gainfully employed, H sends his child to a  dependent care center that complies with all state and local  requirements. The dependent care center requires payment for days when a  child is absent from the center. H takes 8 days off from work as  vacation days. Because the absence is less than 2 consecutive calendar  weeks, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, H's absence is a  short, temporary absence. H is not required to allocate expenses between  days worked and days not worked. The entire fee for the period that  includes the 8 vacation days may be an employment-related expense under  section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. J works 3 days per week and her child attends a dependent  care center (that complies with all state and local requirements) to  enable her to be gainfully employed. The dependent care center allows  payment for any 3 days per week for $150 or 5 days per week for $250. J  enrolls her child for 5 days per week, and her child attends the care  center for 5 days per week. Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section,  J must allocate her expenses for dependent care between days worked and  days not worked. Three-fifths of the $250, or $150 per week, may be an  employment-related expense under section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that the  dependent care center does not offer a 3-day option. The entire $250  weekly fee may be an employment-related expense under section 21.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Care of qualifying individual and household services--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. To qualify for the dependent care credit, expenses must be for  the care of a qualifying individual. Expenses are for the care of a  qualifying individual if the primary function is to assure the  individual's well-being and protection. Not all expenses relating to a  qualifying individual are for the individual's care. Amounts paid for  food, lodging, clothing, or education are not for the care of a  qualifying individual. If, however, the care is provided in such a  manner that the expenses cover other goods or services that are  incidental to and inseparably a part of the care, the full amount is for  care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allocation of expenses. If an expense is partly for household  services or for the care of a qualifying individual and partly for other  goods or services, a reasonable allocation must be made. Only so much of  the expense that is allocable to the household services or care of a  qualifying individual is an employment-related expense. An allocation  must be made if a housekeeper or other domestic employee performs  household duties and cares for the qualifying children of the taxpayer  and also performs other services for the taxpayer. No allocation is  required, however, if the expense for the other purpose is minimal or  insignificant or if an expense is partly attributable to the care of a  qualifying individual and partly to household services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> if the  services are provided, at least in part, to the qualifying individual.  Such services as are performed by chauffeurs, bartenders, or gardeners  are not household services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manner of providing care. The manner of providing care need not  be the least expensive alternative available to the taxpayer. The cost  of a paid caregiver may be an expense for the care of a qualifying  individual even if another caregiver is available at no cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> School or similar program. Expenses for a child in nursery  school, pre-school, or similar programs for children below the level of  kindergarten are for the care of a qualifying individual and may be  employment-related expenses. Expenses for a child in kindergarten or a  higher grade are not for the care of a qualifying individual. However,  expenses for before- or after-school care of a child in kindergarten   or a higher grade may be for the care of a qualifying individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Overnight camps. Expenses for overnight camps are not  employment-related expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Day camps. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost of a day camp or similar program may be  for the care of a qualifying individual and an employment-related  expense, without allocation under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, even  if the day camp specializes in a particular activity. Summer school and  tutoring programs are not for the care of a qualifying individual and  the costs are not employment-related expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A day camp that meets the definition of dependent care center  in section 21(b)(2)(D) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section must comply  with the requirements of section 21(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Transportation. The cost of transportation by a dependent care  provider of a qualifying individual to or from a place where care of  that qualifying individual is provided may be for the care of the  qualifying individual. The cost of transportation not provided by a  dependent care provider is not for the care of the qualifying  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Employment taxes. Taxes under sections 3111 (relating to the  Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and 3301 (relating to the Federal  Unemployment Tax Act) and similar state payroll taxes are employment- related expenses if paid in respect of wages that are employment-related  expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Room and board. The additional cost of providing room and board  for a caregiver over usual household expenditures may be an employment- related expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Indirect expenses. Expenses that relate to, but are not  directly for, the care of a qualifying individual, such as application  fees, agency fees, and deposits, may be for the care of a qualifying  individual and may be employment-related expenses if the taxpayer is  required to pay the expenses to obtain the related care. However,  forfeited deposits and other payments are not for the care of a  qualifying individual if care is not provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (d) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. To be gainfully employed, K sends his 3-year old child to  a pre-school. The pre-school provides lunch and snacks. Under paragraph  (d)(1) of this section, K is not required to allocate expenses between  care and the lunch and snacks, because the lunch and snacks are  incidental to and inseparably a part of the care. Therefore, K may treat  the full amount paid to the pre-school as for the care of his child.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. L, a member of the armed forces, is ordered to a combat  zone. To be able to comply with the orders, L places her 10-year old  child in boarding school. The school provides education, meals, and  housing to L's child in addition to care. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this  section, L must allocate the cost of the boarding school between  expenses for care and expenses for education and other services not  constituting care. Only the part of the cost of the boarding school that  is for the care of L's child is an employment-related expense under  section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. To be gainfully employed, M employs a full-time  housekeeper to care for M's two children, aged 9 and 13 years. The  housekeeper regularly performs household services of cleaning and  cooking and drives M to and from M's place of employment, a trip of 15  minutes each way. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the chauffeur  services are not household services. M is not required to allocate a  portion of the expense of the housekeeper to the chauffeur services  under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, however, because the chauffeur  services are minimal and insignificant. Further, no allocation under  paragraph (d)(2) of this section is required to determine the portion of  the expenses attributable to the care of the 13-year old child (not a  qualifying individual) because the household expenses are in part  attributable to the care of the 9-year-old child. Accordingly, the  entire expense of employing the housekeeper is an employment-related  expense. The amount that M may take into account as an employment- related expense under section 21, however, is limited to the amount  allowable for one qualifying individual.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. To be gainfully employed, N sends her 9-year-old child to  a summer day camp that offers computer activities and recreational  activities such as swimming and arts and crafts. Under paragraph  (d)(7)(i) of this section, the full cost of the summer day camp may be  for care.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. To be gainfully employed, O sends her 9-year-old child to  a math tutoring program for two hours per day during the summer. Under  paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, the cost of the tutoring program is  not for care.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. To be gainfully employed, P hires a full-time housekeeper  to care for her 8-year old child. In order to accommodate   the housekeeper, P moves from a 2-bedroom apartment to a 3-bedroom  apartment that otherwise is comparable to the 2-bedroom apartment. Under  paragraph (d)(10) of this section, the additional cost to rent the 3- bedroom apartment over the cost of the 2-bedroom apartment and any  additional utilities attributable to the housekeeper's residence in the  household may be employment-related expenses under section 21.</p><p class="depth3">Example 7. Q pays a fee to an agency to obtain the services of an au  pair to care for Q's children, qualifying individuals, to enable Q to be  gainfully employed. An au pair from the agency subsequently provides  care for Q's children. Under paragraph (d)(11) of this section, the fee  may be an employment-related expense.</p><p class="depth3">Example 8. R places a deposit with a pre-school to reserve a place  for her child. R sends the child to a different pre-school and forfeits  the deposit. Under paragraph (d)(11) of this section, the forfeited  deposit is not an employment-related expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Services outside the taxpayer's household--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  credit is allowable for expenses for services performed outside the  taxpayer's household only if the care is for one or more qualifying  individuals who are described in this section at--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, (b)(1)(iii), or (b)(2)(iii)  and regularly spend at least 8 hours each day in the taxpayer's  household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dependent care centers--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The credit is allowable  for services performed by a dependent care center only if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The center complies with all applicable laws and regulations, if  any, of a state or local government, such as state or local licensing  requirements and building and fire code regulations; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The requirements provided in this paragraph (e) are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Definition. The term dependent care center means any facility  that provides full-time or part-time care for more than six individuals  (other than individuals who reside at the facility) on a regular basis  during the taxpayer's taxable year, and receives a fee, payment, or  grant for providing services for the individuals (regardless of whether  the facility is operated for profit). For purposes of the preceding  sentence, a facility is presumed to provide full-time or part-time care  for six or fewer individuals on a regular basis during the taxpayer's  taxable year if the facility has six or fewer individuals (including the  taxpayer's qualifying individual) enrolled for full-time or part-time  care on the day the qualifying individual is enrolled in the facility  (or on the first day of the taxable year the qualifying individual  attends the facility if the qualifying individual was enrolled in the  facility in the preceding taxable year) unless the Internal Revenue  Service demonstrates that the facility provides full-time or part-time  care for more than six individuals on a regular basis during the  taxpayer's taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reimbursed expenses. Employment-related expenses for which the  taxpayer is reimbursed (for example, under a dependent care assistance  program) may not be taken into account for purposes of the credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Principal place of abode. For purposes of this section, the term  principal place of abode has the same meaning as in section 152.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Maintenance of a household--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For taxable years  beginning before January 1, 2005, the credit is available only to a  taxpayer who maintains a household that includes one or more qualifying  individuals. A taxpayer maintains a household for the taxable year (or  lesser period) only if the taxpayer (and spouse, if applicable) occupies  the household and furnishes over one-half of the cost for the taxable  year (or lesser period) of maintaining the household. The household must  be the principal place of abode for the taxable year of the taxpayer and  the qualifying individual or individuals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cost of maintaining a household. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, for purposes of this section, the  term cost of maintaining a household has the same meaning as in Sec.   1.2-2(d) without regard to the last sentence thereof.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of maintaining a household does not include the value  of services performed in the household by the taxpayer or by a  qualifying individual described in paragraph (b) of this section or any  expense paid or reimbursed by another person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monthly proration of annual costs. In determining the cost of  maintaining a household for a period of less than a   taxable year, the cost for the entire taxable year must be prorated on  the basis of the number of calendar months within that period. A period  of less than a calendar month is treated as a full calendar month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Two or more families. If two or more families occupy living  quarters in common, each of the families is treated as maintaining a  separate household. A taxpayer is maintaining a household if the  taxpayer provides more than one-half of the cost of maintaining the  separate household. For example, if two unrelated taxpayers with their  respective children occupy living quarters in common and each taxpayer  pays more than one-half of the household costs for each respective  family, each taxpayer is treated as maintaining a household.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reserved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Expenses qualifying as medical expenses--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  taxpayer may not take an amount into account as both an employment- related expense under section 21 and an expense for medical care under  section 213.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (j) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. S has $6,500 of employment-related expenses for the care  of his child who is physically incapable of self-care. The expenses are  for services performed in S's household that also qualify as expenses  for medical care under section 213. Of the total expenses, S may take  into account $3,000 under section 21. S may deduct the balance of the  expenses, or $3,500, as expenses for medical care under section 213 to  the extent the expenses exceed 7.5 percent of S's adjusted gross income.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, however, S first  takes into account the $6,500 of expenses under section 213. S deducts  $500 as an expense for medical care, which is the amount by which the  expenses exceed 7.5 percent of his adjusted gross income. S may not take  into account the $6,000 balance as employment-related expenses under  section 21, because he has taken the full amount of the expenses into  account in computing the amount deductible under section 213.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Substantiation. A taxpayer claiming a credit for employment- related expenses must maintain adequate records or other sufficient  evidence to substantiate the expenses in accordance with section 6001  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section and Sec. Sec.  1.21-2  through 1.21-4 apply to taxable years ending after August 14, 2007.  [T.D. 9354, 72 FR 45341, Aug. 14, 2007]</p>
