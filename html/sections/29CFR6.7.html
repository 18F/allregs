In the event that a party appears at the  hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the presiding  Administrative Law Judge is authorized, if such party fails to show good  cause for such failure to appear, to dismiss the case or to find the  facts as alleged in the complaint and to enter a default judgment  containing such findings, conclusions and order as are appropriate. Only  where a petition for review of such default judgment cites alleged  procedural irregularities in the proceeding below and not the merits of  the case shall a non-appearing party be permitted to file such a  petition for review. Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed  to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the  Administrative Law Judge's decision.</p>
