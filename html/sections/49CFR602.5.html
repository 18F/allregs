                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this part:</p><p class="depth0">Affected recipient. A recipient or subrecipient that operates public transportation service in an area impacted by an emergency or major disaster.</p><p class="depth0">Applicant. An entity that operates or allocates funds to an entity to operate public transportation service and that applies for a grant under 49 U.S.C. 5324.</p><p class="depth0">Building. For insurance purposes, a structure with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site. This includes manufactured or modular office trailers that are built on a permanent chassis, transported to a site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation.</p><p class="depth0">Catastrophic failure. The sudden failure of a major element or segment of the public transportation system due to an external cause. The failure must not be primarily attributable to gradual and progressive deterioration, lack of proper maintenance or a design flaw.</p><p class="depth0">Contents coverage. For insurance purposes, contents are personal property within a building, including fixtures, machinery, equipment and supplies. In addition to the costs to repair or replace, contents insurance coverage shall include the cost of debris removal and the reasonable cost of removal of contents to minimize damage.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency. A natural disaster affecting a wide area (such as a flood, hurricane, tidal wave, earthquake, severe

storm or landslide) or a catastrophic failure from any external cause, as a result of which:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The Governor of a State has declared an emergency and the Secretary of Transportation has concurred; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The President has declared a major disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170).</p><p class="depth0">Emergency operations. The net project cost of temporary service that is outside the scope of an affected recipient's normal operations, including but not limited to: evacuations; rescue operations; bus, ferry, or rail service to replace inoperable service or to detour around damaged areas; additional service to accommodate an influx of passengers or evacuees; returning evacuees to their homes after the disaster or emergency; and the net project costs related to reestablishing, expanding, or relocating public transportation service before, during, or after an emergency or major disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Projects undertaken immediately before, during or following the emergency or major disaster for the purpose of protecting public health and safety or for protecting property. Such projects:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Eliminate or lessen immediate threats to public health or safety; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Eliminate or lessen immediate threats of significant damage or additional damage to an affected recipient's property through measures that are cost effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Examples of such projects include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Moving rolling stock in order to protect it from damage, e.g., to higher ground in order to protect it from storm surges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Emergency communications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Security measures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Sandbagging;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Bracing/shoring damaged structures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(vi)</em> Debris removal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(vii)</em> Dewatering; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(viii)</em> Removal of health and safety hazards.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency repairs. Capital projects undertaken following the emergency or major disaster, until such time as permanent repairs can be undertaken, for the purpose of:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Minimizing the extent of the damage,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Restoring service, or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Ensuring service can continue to be provided until permanent repairs are made.</p><p class="depth2">External cause. An outside force or phenomenon that is separate from the damaged element and not primarily the result of existing conditions.</p><p class="depth2">Heavy maintenance. Work usually done by a recipient or subrecipient in repairing damage normally expected from seasonal and occasionally unusual natural conditions or occurrences, such as routine snow removal, debris removal from seasonal thunderstorms, or heavy repairs necessitated by excessive deferred maintenance. This may include work required as a direct result of a disaster, but which can reasonably be accommodated by a recipient or subrecipient's routine maintenance, emergency or contingency program.</p><p class="depth2">Incident period. The time interval during which the emergency-causing incident occurs. FTA will not approve pre-award authority for projects unless the damage to be alleviated resulted from the emergency-causing incident during the incident period or was incurred in anticipation of that incident. For each Stafford Act incident, FTA will adopt the incident period established by FEMA.</p><p class="depth2">Major disaster. Any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby. 42 U.S.C. 5122.</p><p class="depth2">Net project cost. The part of a project that reasonably cannot be financed from revenues. 49 U.S.C. 5302.</p><p class="depth2">Permanent repairs. Capital projects undertaken following the emergency or

major disaster for the purpose of repairing, replacing or reconstructing seriously damaged public transportation system elements, including rolling stock, equipment, facilities and infrastructure, as necessary to restore the elements to a state of good repair.</p><p class="depth2">Recipient. An entity that operates public transportation service and receives Federal transit funds directly from FTA.</p><p class="depth2">Resilience. The ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions such as significant multi-hazard threats with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy, and the environment.</p><p class="depth2">Resilience project. A project designed and built to address existing and future vulnerabilities to a public transportation facility or system due to a probable occurrence or recurrence of an emergency or major disaster in the geographic area in which the public transportation system is located, and which may include the consideration of projected changes in development patterns, demographics, or climate change and extreme weather patterns. A resilience project may be a stand-alone project or may be completed at the same time as permanent repairs.</p><p class="depth2">Serious damage. Heavy, major or unusual damage to a public transportation facility which severely impairs the safety or usefulness of the facility. Serious damage must be beyond the scope of heavy maintenance.</p><p class="depth2">State. A State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth2">Subrecipient. An entity that operates public transportation service and receives FTA funding through a recipient.</p>
