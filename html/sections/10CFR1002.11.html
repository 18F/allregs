                            <p class="depth0">The Department of Energy hereby prescribes as its official seal, of  which judicial notice shall be taken pursuant to section 654 of the  Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7264, the  imprint illustrated below and described as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01OC91.039</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The official seal includes a green shield bisected by a gold- colored lightning bolt, on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic  sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo. It is   crested by the white head of an eagle, atop a white rope. Both appear on  a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the  agency, in gold, appears on a green background. Detailing is in black.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The colors used in the configuration are dark green, dark blue,  gold, black, and white.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness  of efforts required to respond to the Nation's increasing demands for  energy. The sun, atom, oil derrick, windmill, and dynamo serve as  representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet  these demands. The rope represents the cohesiveness in the development  of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities. The  lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which  energy is derived and the Nation's challenge in harnessing the forces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The color scheme is derived from nature, symbolizing both the  source of energy and the support of man's existence. The blue field  represents air and water, green represents mineral resources and the  earth itself, and gold represents the creation of energy in the release  of natural forces. By invoking this symbolism, the color scheme  represents the Nation's commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner  consistent with the preservation of the natural environment.</p>
