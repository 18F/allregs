                            <p class="depth0">The Commission will designate one or more SAS Administrators to provide nationwide service. The Commission may, at its discretion, permit the functions of an SAS, such as a data repository, registration, and query services, to be divided among multiple entities; however, it shall designate one or more specific entities to be an SAS Administrator responsible for coordinating the overall functioning of an SAS and providing services to operators in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service. Each SAS Administrator designated by the Commission must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Maintain a regularly updated database that contains the information described in Sec. 96.55.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establish a process for acquiring and storing in the database necessary and appropriate information from the Commission's databases, including PAL assignments, and synchronizing the database with the current Commission databases at least once a day to include newly licensed facilities or any changes to licensed facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Establish and follow protocols and procedures to ensure compliance with the rules set forth in this part, including the SAS functions set forth in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establish and follow protocols and procedures sufficient to ensure that all communications and interactions between the SAS, ESC, and CBSDs are accurate and secure and that unauthorized parties cannot access or alter the SAS or the information transmitted from the SAS to CBSDs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provide service for a five-year term. This term may be renewed at the Commission's discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Respond in a timely manner to verify, correct or remove, as appropriate, data in the event that the Commission or a party brings a claim of inaccuracies in the SAS to its attention. This requirement applies only to information that the Commission requires to be stored in the SAS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Securely transfer the information in the SAS, along with the IP addresses and URLs used to access the system, and a list of registered CBSDs, to another approved entity in the event it does not continue as the SAS Administrator at the end of its term. It may charge a reasonable price for such conveyance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Cooperate to develop a standardized process for coordinating operations with other SASs, avoiding any conflicting assignments, maximizing shared use of available frequencies, ensuring continuity of service to all registered CBSDs, and providing the data collected pursuant to Sec. 96.55.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Coordinate with other SAS Administrators including, to the extent possible, sharing information, facilitating non-interfering use by CBSDs connected to other SASs, maximizing available General Authorized Access

frequencies by assigning PALs to similar channels in the same geographic regions, and other functions necessary to ensure that available spectrum is used efficiently consistent with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Provide a means to make non-federal non-proprietary information available to the public in a reasonably accessible fashion in conformity with the rules in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Ensure that the SAS shall be available at all times to immediately respond to requests from authorized Commission personnel for any and all information stored or retained by the SAS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Establish and follow protocols to respond to instructions from the President of the United States, or another designated Federal government entity, issued pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 606.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Establish and follow protocols to comply with enforcement instructions from the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Ensure that the SAS:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operates without any connectivity to any military or other sensitive federal database or system, except as otherwise required by this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Does not store, retain, transmit, or disclose operational information on the movement or position of any federal system or any information that reveals other operational information of any federal system that is not required by this part to effectively operate the SAS.</p><p class="depth3">Effective Date Note: At 80 FR 36222, June 23, 2015, Sec. 96.63 was added, however, this section contains information collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
