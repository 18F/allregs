                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The fleet average standards referred to in this section are the  corporate fleet average standards for FTP exhaust NOX  emissions set forth in: Sec. 86.1811-04(d) for Tier 2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs  (0.07 g/mi); Sec. 86.1811-04(l)(3) for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs  (0.30 g/mi); and, Sec. 86.1811-04(l)(3) for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/ MDPVs (0.20 g/mi). Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the  provisions of this section apply to all three corporate fleet average  standards, except that the interim non-Tier 2 fleet average  NOX standards do not apply to a manufacturer whose U.S. LDV/T  and MDPV sales are 100% Tier 2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each manufacturer must comply with the applicable fleet  average NOX standard, or standards, on a sales weighted  average basis, at the end of each model year, using the procedure  described in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During a phase-in year, the manufacturer must comply with the  applicable fleet average NOX standard for the required phase- in percentage for that year as specified in Sec. 86.1811-04(k)(1), or  for the alternate phase-in percentage as permitted under Sec. 86.1811- 04(k)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each manufacturer must separately compute the sales  weighted averages of the individual NOX emission standards to  which it certified all its Tier 2 vehicles, interim non-Tier 2 LDV/ LLDTs, and interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs of a given model year as  described in Sec. 86.1804(l)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For model years up to and including 2008, manufacturers must  compute   separate NOX fleet averages for Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and Tier 2  HLDT/MDPVs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For model years up to and including 2008, if a manufacturer  certifies its entire U.S. sales of Tier 2 or interim non-Tier 2 LDV/ LLDTs or interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs, to full useful life bins having  NOX standards at or below the applicable fleet average  NOX standard, that manufacturer may elect not to compute a  fleet average NOX level for that category of vehicles. A  manufacturer making such an election must not generate NOX  credits for that category of vehicles for that model year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For model years after 2008, if a manufacturer certifies its  entire U.S. sales of Tier 2 vehicles to full useful life bins having  NOX standards at or below 0.07 gpm, that manufacturer may  elect not to compute a fleet average NOX level for its Tier 2  vehicles. A manufacturer making such an election must not generate  NOX credits for that model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The sales weighted NOX fleet averages determined  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must be compared with the  applicable fleet average standard; 0.07 g/mi for NOX for Tier  2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs, 0.30 g/mi for NOX for interim non-Tier 2  LDV/LLDTs, and 0.20 g/mi for NOx for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs.

When  applying credits to reduce or eliminate a deficit under the fleet  average standard for interim LDV/LLDTs or interim HLDT/MDPVs, that has  been carried forward into a year subsequent to its generation, a  manufacturer may apply credits from Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs or Tier 2 HLDT/ MDPVs, respectively, as well as from the appropriate group of interim  vehicles. A manufacturer must not use interim credits to reduce or  eliminate any NOX credit deficit under the Tier 2 fleet  average standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A manufacturer carrying a credit deficit into the third year  must generate or obtain credits to offset that deficit and apply them to  the deficit at a rate of 1.2:1, (i.e. deficits carried into the third  model year must be repaid with credits equal to 120 percent of the  deficit).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer must not bank credits for future model years or  trade credits to another manufacturer during a model year into which it  has carried a deficit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Computing fleet average NOX emissions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Manufacturers must separately compute these fleet NOX  averages using the equation contained in paragraph (f)(2) of this  section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Their Tier 2 LDV/LLDT and Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV fleet average  NOX emissions for each model year through 2008;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Their combined Tier 2 LDV/T and MDPV fleet average  NOX emissions for each model year after 2008;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Their interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDT fleet average NOX  emissions for each model year through 2006; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Their interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV fleet average NOX  emissions for each model year through 2008.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The equation for computing fleet average NOX  emissions is as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10FE00.012  Where:  N = The number of vehicles sold in the applicable category that were</p><p class="depth3">certified for each corresponding NOX emission bin.</p><p class="depth3">N must be based on vehicles counted to the point of first</p><p class="depth3">sale.

The  reduction in NOX emissions must be determined using good  engineering judgement and reflect the relation in actual full useful  life NOX emissions to the full useful life NOX  standards for the certification bin applicable to the vehicles. The  Administrator may require that calculation of the HEV NOX  contribution factor include vehicle parameters such as vehicle weight,  portion of time during the test procedure that the HEV operates with  zero exhaust emissions, zero emission range, NOX emissions  from fuel-fired heaters and NOX emissions from electricity  production and storage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional credits for vehicles certified to 150,000 mile useful  lives. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may certify any test group to an optional  useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For any test group certified to the optional 15 year/150,000  mile useful life, the manufacturer may generate additional  NOX credits, except as prohibited in paragraph (g)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer must calculate these extra NOX  credits, where permitted, by substituting an adjusted NOX  standard for the applicable NOX standard from the full useful  life certification bin when it calculates the applicable fleet average  NOX emissions by the procedure in paragraph (f) of this  section. The adjusted standard must be equal to the applicable full  useful life NOX standard multiplied by 0.85 and rounded to  one more decimal place than the number of decimal places as the  applicable full useful life NOX standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer electing not to comply with applicable  intermediate life standards as permitted under Sec. 86.1811-04(c)(4) may  not generate additional credits from vehicles certified to a useful life  of 15 years/150,000 miles; except that, for bins where such intermediate  life standards do not exist or are specifically deemed to be optional in  Sec. 86.1811-04(c)(4), the manufacturer may generate additional  NOX credits from vehicles certified to a useful life of 15  years/150,000 miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional credits for vehicles certified to low bins. A  manufacturer may obtain additional NOX credits by certifying  vehicles to bins 1 and/or 2 in model years from 2001 through 2005  subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When computing the fleet average Tier 2 NOX emissions  using the formula in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the manufacturer  may multiply the number of vehicles certified to bins 1 and 2 by the  applicable multiplier shown in   Table S04-11 when computing the denominator in the formula. These  multipliers may not be used after model year 2005.
