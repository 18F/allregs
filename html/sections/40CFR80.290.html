                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The refiner must submit an application to EPA which includes the information required under paragraph (c) of this section no later than September 30 of the year in which the refiner plans to begin generating credits, or the refiner or an importer plans to sell gasoline in the geographic phase-in area in accordance with Sec. 80.217.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The sulfur baseline request must be sent to: U.S. EPA, Attn: Sulfur Program (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460. For commercial (non-postal) delivery: U.S. EPA, Attn: Sulfur Program, 501 3rd Street NW., Washington, DC 20001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The sulfur baseline application must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A listing of the names and addresses of all refineries owned by the corporation for which the refiner is applying for a sulfur baseline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The annual average gasoline sulfur baseline for gasoline produced in 1997-1998, for each refinery for which the refiner is applying for a sulfur baseline, calculated in accordance with Sec. 80.295.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer, of the company, or his/her delegate, stating that the information contained in the sulfur baseline determination is true to the best of his/her knowledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name, address, phone number, facsimile number and E-mail address of a corporate contact person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The following information for each batch of gasoline produced in 1997-1998:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Batch number assigned to the batch under Sec. 80.65(d) or Sec. 80.101(i);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Volume; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sulfur content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For any refiner that acquires and/or reactivates a refinery that was shut down or non-operational between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1998, the average sulfur level of gasoline produced during each annual averaging period that the refinery was in operation after the refinery was acquired and/or reactivated. EPA will evaluate all of

the data submitted by the refiner in determining the appropriate sulfur baseline for the refinery. Where EPA concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, the refinery's baseline will be determined based on the average sulfur content of the refinery's gasoline production during the most recent annual averaging period the refinery was in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> Foreign refiners who do not have an approved refinery baseline under Sec. 80.94 must follow the procedures specified in Sec. 80.410(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Foreign refiners who do not have an approved refinery baseline under Sec. 80.94 must follow the procedures specified in Sec. 80.410(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Foreign refiners who have an approved individual refinery baseline under Sec. 80.94, but one that was not in effect for purposes of anti-dumping compliance during the 1997-1998 annual averaging periods, must comply with the requirements of this section for the gasoline produced at the refinery and imported to the U.S. during each annual averaging period in which the refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline. EPA will evaluate all of the information and data submitted under this section in determining a foreign refinery's sulfur baseline pursuant to this paragraph (d). Where EPA concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, a foreign refinery's baseline sulfur level under this paragraph will be determined based on the average sulfur level of gasoline produced by the foreign refinery and imported to the U.S. during the most recent annual averaging period in which the refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within 60 days of receipt of an application under this section, EPA will notify the refiner of approval of the refinery's baseline or of any deficiencies in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If at any time the baseline submitted in accordance with the requirements of this section is determined to be incorrect, EPA will notify the refiner of the corrected baseline.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any refiner that seeks temporary relief under Sec. 80.270 shall apply for a refinery sulfur baseline in accordance with the provisions of this section and Sec. 80.295, and if applicable, Sec. 80.410(b), no later than September 1, 2000.
