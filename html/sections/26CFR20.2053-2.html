                            <p class="depth0">Such amounts for funeral expenses are allowed as deductions from a  decedent's gross estate as (a) are actually expended, (b) would be  properly allowable out of property subject to claims under the laws of  the local jurisdiction, and (c) satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (c) of Sec. 20.2053-1. A reasonable expenditure for a tombstone,  monument, or mausoleum, or for a burial lot, either for the decedent or  his family, including a reasonable expenditure for its future care, may  be deducted under this heading, provided such an expenditure is  allowable by the local law. Included in funeral expenses is the cost of  transportation of the person bringing the body to the place of burial.</p>
