                            <p class="depth0">A solvent extraction process for recovery of citric acid from conventional Aspergillus niger fermentation liquor may be safely used to produce food-grade citric acid in accordance with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The solvent used in the process consists of a mixture of n-octyl alcohol meeting the requirements of Sec.  172.864 of this chapter, synthetic isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons meeting the requirements of Sec.  172.882 of this chapter, and tridodecyl amine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The component substances are used solely as a solvent mixture and in a manner that does not result in formation of products not present in conventionally produced citric acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The citric acid so produced meets the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon specifications of Sec.  173.165 and the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 7th ed. (2010), pp. 226-227, which is incorporated by reference. The Director of the Office of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Current good manufacturing practice results in residues not exceeding 16 parts per million (ppm) n-octyl alcohol and 0.47 ppm synthetic isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons in citric acid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Tridodecyl amine may be present as a residue in citric acid at a level not to exceed 100 parts per billion.
