                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in this subpart provide for a limited, Federal,  title V, permit program to establish alternative emission limitations  for early reductions sources that have demonstrated qualifying  reductions of hazardous air pollutants under section 112(i)(5) of the  Act. A permit issued under this subpart which establishes such an  enforceable alternative emission limitation shall grant all emissions  units in the early reductions source a six-year extension from otherwise  applicable dates of compliance for standards promulgated under section  112(d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After approval of a State's comprehensive permit program  pursuant to title V of the Act, the Administrator may continue to issue  specialty permits under this subpart only under the following  circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The early reductions source filed a permit application under  this subpart before the State obtained approval of a comprehensive title  V permit program but the permit had not been finally issued at the time  of State program approval; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The early reductions source will be required to file an early  reductions permit application under Sec. 71.24(b) before a  comprehensive permit application is required by the State under the  approved program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a circumstance described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of  this section occurs, the primary consideration in the Administrator's  decision to issue a specialty permit is the degree of delay anticipated  by deferring to the State for permit issuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Permit issued to an early reductions source under this subpart  shall have a term not to exceed five years.   Such a specialty permit shall be incorporated into a comprehensive title  V permit subsequently issued to the facility containing the early  reductions source, without reopening or revision of the specialty permit  except as provided in Sec. 71.26(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance of a specialty permit under this subpart does not  relieve a source from an obligation to file a timely and complete  comprehensive permit application as required under an approved  comprehensive title V permit program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Delegation to other permitting authorities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  Administrator may delegate to another permitting authority the  responsibility to implement this permit program. Under such a  delegation, the Administrator reserves the right to issue a final permit  to early reductions sources that filed permit applications with the  Administrator prior to the permitting authority obtaining delegation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under any delegation, the Administrator will require that the  permitting authority have enforcement authority substantially equivalent  to that specified in Sec. 70.11 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon any delegation, administrative appeals of permit decisions  issuing pursuant to the delegated program shall continue to be subject  to the requirements of Sec. 71.27(l).</p>
