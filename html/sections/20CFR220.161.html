                                Sec. 220.161  How work affects an employee disability annuity.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In addition to the condition in Sec. 220.160, the employee's disability annuity is not payable and the employee must return the annuity payment for any month in which the employee earns more than $400 (after deduction of impairment-related work expenses) in employment or self-employment of any kind. Any annuity amounts withheld because the annuitant earned over $400 in a month may be paid after the end of the year, as shown in Sec. 220.164. The $400 monthly limit no longer applies when the employee attains retirement age and the disability annuity is converted to a full age annuity. See Sec. 220.145 for the definition of impairment-related work expenses.
