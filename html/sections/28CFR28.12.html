                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Bureau of Prisons shall collect a DNA sample from each  individual in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons who is, or has been,  convicted of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Federal offense (including any offense under the Uniform Code  of Military Justice); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A qualifying District of Columbia offense, as determined under  section 4(d) of Public Law 106-546.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any agency of the United States that arrests or detains  individuals or supervises individuals facing charges shall collect DNA  samples from individuals who are arrested, facing charges, or convicted,  and from non-United States persons who are detained under the authority  of the United States. For purposes of this paragraph, ``non-United  States persons'' means persons who are not United States citizens and  who are not lawfully admitted for permanent residence as defined in 8  CFR 1.1(p). Unless otherwise directed by the Attorney General, the  collection of DNA samples under this paragraph may be limited to  individuals from whom the agency collects fingerprints and may be  subject to other limitations or exceptions approved by the Attorney  General.
