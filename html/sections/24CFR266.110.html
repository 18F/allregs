An HFA with a top tier or equivalent  designation or an HFA with an overall rating of ``A'' on its general  obligation bonds is not required to have additional reserves so long as  the HFA maintains that designation or rating, unless the Commissioner  determines that a prescribed level of reserves is necessary. If the  designation or rating is lost, the HFA must immediately establish a  reserve account funded in accordance with the requirements set forth in  paragraph (b) of this section. The reserve account must reflect all  loans in the HFA's portfolio endorsed under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other HFAs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For other HFAs, a specifically identified  dedicated account consisting entirely of liquid assets (i.e., cash or  cash equivalents or readily marketable securities) must be established  and maintained in a financial institution acceptable to HUD. This  account may be drawn upon by HUD and may be used by the HFA only with  the prior written approval of HUD for the purpose of meeting the HFA's  risk-sharing obligations under this part. The account must be  established prior to the execution of any Risk Sharing Agreement under  this part in an initial amount of not less than $500,000. Thereafter,  the HFA must deposit at each loan closing and thereafter maintain the  following additional amounts in the dedicated account:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $10.00 per $1,000 of the unpaid principal balance that is equal  to or less than $50 million; plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $7.50 per $1,000 of the unpaid principal balance that is  greater than $50 million and less than $150 million; plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> $5.00 per $1,000 of the unpaid principal balance that is  greater than $150 million.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commissioner may determine that higher levels of reserves  may be necessary.</p>
