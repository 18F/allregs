                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fluorescent lamp ballasts and luminaires--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contents.  Fluorescent lamp ballasts that are ``covered products,'' as defined in  Sec. 305.2(n), and to which standards are applicable under section 325  of the Act, shall be marked conspicuously, in color-contrasting ink,  with a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle. Packaging for such  fluorescent lamp ballasts, as well as packaging for luminaires into  which they are incorporated, shall also be marked conspicuously with a  capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle. For purposes of this  section, the encircled capital letter ``E'' will be deemed  ``conspicuous,'' in terms of size, if it is as large as either the  manufacturer's name or another logo, such as the ``UL,'' ``CBM'' or  ``ETL'' logos, whichever is larger, that appears on the fluorescent lamp  ballast, the packaging for such ballast or the packaging for the  luminaire into which the covered ballast is incorporated, whichever is  applicable for purpose of labeling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Product labeling. The encircled capital letter ``E'' on  fluorescent lamp ballasts must appear conspicuously, in color- contrasting ink, (i.e., in a color that contrasts with the background on  which the encircled capital letter ``E'' is placed) on the surface that  is normally labeled. It may be printed on the label that normally  appears on the fluorescent lamp ballast, printed on a separate label, or  stamped indelibly on the surface of the fluorescent lamp ballast.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Package labeling. For purposes of labeling under this section,  packaging for such fluorescent lamp ballasts and the luminaires into  which they are incorporated consists of the plastic sheeting, or  ``shrink-wrap,'' covering pallet loads of fluorescent lamp ballasts or  luminaires as well as any containers in which such fluorescent lamp  ballasts or the luminaires into which they are incorporated are marketed  individually or in small numbers. The encircled capital letter ``E'' on  packages   containing fluorescent lamp ballasts or the luminaires into which they  are incorporated must appear conspicuously, in color-contrasting ink, on  the surface of the package on which printing or a label normally  appears. If the package contains printing on more than one surface, the  label must appear on the surface on which the product inside the package  is described. The encircled capital letter ``E'' may be printed on the  surface of the package, printed on a label containing other information,  printed on a separate label, or indelibly stamped on the surface of the  package. In the case of pallet loads containing fluorescent lamp  ballasts or the luminaires into which they are incorporated, the  encircled capital letter ``E'' must appear conspicuously, in color- contrasting ink, on the plastic sheeting, unless clear plastic sheeting  is used and the encircled capital letter ``E'' is legible underneath  this packaging. The encircled capital letter ``E'' must also appear  conspicuously on any documentation that would normally accompany such a  pallet load. The encircled capital letter ``E'' may appear on a label  affixed to the sheeting or may be indelibly stamped on the sheeting. It  may be printed on the documentation, printed on a separate label that is  affixed to the documentation or indelibly stamped on the documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General service lamps. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of  this section, any covered product that is a general service lamp shall  be labeled as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Principal display panel content.

If the total surface  area of the product package available for labeling is less than 24  square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate the  standard label required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section,  manufacturers may provide the information specified in paragraph (b)(3)  of this section using a smaller, linear label following the format,  terms, explanatory text, specifications, and minimum sizes illustrated  in Prototype Label 7 in appendix L.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Bilingual labels. The information required by paragraphs (b)(1)  through (5) of this section may be presented in a second language either  by using separate labels for each language or in a bilingual label with  the English text in the format required by this section immediately  followed by the text in the second language. Sample Label 13 in appendix  L provides an example of a bilingual Lighting Facts label. All required  information must be included in both languages. Numeric characters that  are identical in both languages need not be repeated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Product Labeling. Any general service lamp shall be labeled  legibly on the product with the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lamp's average initial lumens, expressed as a number rounded  to the nearest five, adjacent to the word ``lumens,'' both provided in  minimum 8 point font; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For general service lamps containing mercury, the following  statement: ``Mercury disposal: epa.gov/cfl'' in minimum 8 point font.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any covered incandescent lamp that is subject to and does not  comply with the January 1, 2012 or January 1, 2013 efficiency standards  specified in 42 U.S.C. 6295 or the DOE standards at 10 CFR 430.32(n)(5)  effective July 14, 2012 shall be labeled clearly and conspicuously on  the principal display panel of the product package with the following  information in lieu of the labeling requirements specified in paragraph  (b):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The light output, energy usage and life ratings of any product  covered by paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall appear in that order  and with equal clarity and conspicuousness on the product's principal  display panel. The light output, energy usage and life ratings shall be  disclosed in terms of ``lumens,'' ``watts,'' and ``hours'' respectively,  with the lumens, watts, and hours rating numbers each appearing in the  same type style and size and with the words ``lumens,'' ``watts,'' and  ``hours'' each appearing in the same type style and size. The words  ``light output,'' ``energy used,'' and ``life''   shall precede and have the same conspicuousness as both the rating  numbers and the words ``lumens,'' ``watts,'' and ``hours,'' except that  the letters of the words ``lumens,'' ``watts,'' and ``hours'' shall be  approximately 50% of the sizes of those used for the words ``light  output,'' ``energy used,'' and ``life,'' respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The required disclosures of any covered product that is a  general service lamp shall be measured at 120 volts, regardless of the  lamp's design voltage. If a lamp's design voltage is 125 volts or 130  volts, the disclosures of the wattage, light output, energy cost, and  life ratings shall in each instance be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At 120 volts and followed by the phrase ``at 120 volts.'' In  such case, the labels for such lamps also may disclose the lamp's  wattage, light output, energy cost, and life at the design voltage  (e.g., ``Light Output 1710 Lumens at 125 volts''); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the design voltage and followed by the phrase ``at (125  volts/130 volts)'' if the ratings at 120 volts are disclosed clearly and  conspicuously on another panel of the package, and if all panels of the  package that contain a claimed light output, energy cost, wattage or  lifeclearly and conspicuously identify the lamp as ``(125 volt/130  volt),'' and if the principal display panel clearly and conspicuously  discloses the following statement:  This product is designed for (125/130) volts. When used on the normal  line voltage of 120 volts, the light output and energy efficiency are  noticeably reduced. See (side/back) panel for 120 volt ratings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any covered product that is an incandescent reflector lamp,  the required disclosures of light output shall be given for the lamp's  total forward lumens.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp, the  required light output disclosure shall be measured at a base-up  position; but, if the manufacturer or private labeler has reason to  believe that the light output at a base-down position would be more than  5% different, the label also shall disclose the light output at the  base-down position or, if no test data for the base-down position exist,  the fact that at a base-down position the light output might be more  than 5% less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any covered product that is a general service lamp and  operates at discrete, multiple light levels (e.g., 800, 1600, and 2500  lumens), the light output, energy cost, and wattage disclosures required  by this section must be provided at each of the lamp's levels of light  output and the lamp's life provided on the basis of the shortest lived  operating mode. The multiple numbers shall be separated by a ``/''  (e.g., 800/1600/2500 lumens) if they appear on the same line on the  label.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A manufacturer or private labeler who distributes general  service fluorescent lamps or general service lamps without labels  attached to the lamps or without labels on individual retail-sale  packaging for one or more lamps may meet the package disclosure  requirements of this section by making the required disclosures, in the  manner and form required by those paragraphs, on the bulk shipping  cartons that are to be used to display the lamps for retail sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any manufacturer or private labeler who makes any  representation, other than those required by this section, on a package  of any covered product that is a general service fluorescent lamp or  general service lamp regarding the cost of operation or life of such  lamp shall clearly and conspicuously disclose in close proximity to such  representation the assumptions upon which it is based, including, e.g.,  purchase price, unit cost of electricity, hours of use, patterns of use.  If those assumptions differ from those required for the cost and life  information on the Lighting Facts label (11 cents per kWh and 3 hours  per day), the manufacturer or private labeler must also disclose, with  equal clarity and conspicuousness and in close proximity to, the same  representation based on the assumptions for cost and life required on  the Lighting Facts label.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any covered product that is a general service fluorescent  lamp or an incandescent reflector lamp shall be labeled clearly and  conspicuously with a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle and  followed by an asterisk.
