                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interim disposition of remains. Generally, local authorities will assume custody of the remains of deceased victims of the accident and consign them to a mortuary until final disposition can be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Identification of remains. When necessary, the local Foreign Service post should assist in identifying the remains of United States citizens who are victims of the accident by requesting the Department to procure dental charts, passport application data and photographs, fingerprints, or other United States records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reports on deaths of United States citizens. The local Foreign Service post shall report the deaths of United States citizens occurring in an aircraft accident in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Sec. Sec. 72.1 to 72.8 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disposition of remains. When a scheduled United States air carrier meets with an accident, the United States airline concerned will usually transport the identifiable remains of victims of the accident to the place of final interment designated by the next of kin. If the Foreign Service post is requested, or finds it necessary, to dispose of identifiable remains, it shall follow the procedure prescribed in Sec. Sec. 72.9 to 72.14 of this chapter. Where remains are unidentifiable, the local authorities may be expected to make final disposition of these remains locally in accordance with the health requirements of the country concerned, usually by common burial or by cremation, and without regard to the disposition desired by possible next of kin.</p>
