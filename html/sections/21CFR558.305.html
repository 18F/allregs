The liquid Type B  feeds must have a pH of 6.0 to 8.0, dry matter of 62 to 75 percent, and  bear appropriate mixing directions as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems:  Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving  not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom  of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when not  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation  type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10  minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible  at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The expiration date for the liquid Type B feed is 21 days after  date of manufacture. The expiration date for the dry Type C feed made  from the liquid Type B feed is 7 days after date of manufacture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Labeling for all Type B feeds (liquid and dry) and Type C feeds  containing laidlomycin shall bear the following statements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Do not allow horses or other equines access to feeds containing  laidlomycin propionate potassium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The safety of laidlomycin propionate potassium in unapproved  species has not been established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Not for use in animals intended for breeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Conditions of use.
