The annual uncontrolled nonepoxide organic HAP emissions, determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and annual average flow rate, determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, shall be determined for all process vents from batch unit operations associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product, with the exception of those vents specified in paragraph (i) of this section, at the location after all applicable control techniques have been applied to reduce epoxide emissions in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the owner or operator is using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to reduce epoxide emissions, this location shall be at the exit of the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the owner or operator is using ECO to reduce epoxide emissions, this location shall be at the exit from the batch unit operation.

Alternatively, engineering assessment, as described in Sec.  63.488(b)(6)(i), may be used to determine the effects of the process change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Based on the results of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the redetermination described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section indicates that the group status of the combination of process vents from batch unit operations in a PMPU that are associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product changes from Group 2 to Group 1 as a result of the process change, the owner or operator shall submit a report as specified in Sec.  63.1439(e)(6)(iii)(D)(1) and shall comply with Group 1 combination of batch process vents provisions in this subpart, as specified in Sec.  63.1425(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the redetermination described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section indicates no change in group status, the owner or operator is not required to submit a report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Process vents from continuous unit operations.

Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, increases in production capacity or production rate, changes in feedstock type or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, process changes do not include: process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are within the range on which the original TRE calculation was based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on measurements of process vent stream flow rate, TOC,

and nonepoxide organic HAP concentrations, and heating values as specified in the HON process vent group determination procedures in Sec.  63.115(a), (b), (c), and (d), as applicable, or on best engineering assessment of the effects of the change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec.  63.115(d)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 1.0, or, where the TRE index value before the process change was greater than 4.0 and the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 4.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall submit a report as specified in the process vent reporting and recordkeeping provisions in Sec.  63.1430(i) or (j), and shall comply with the appropriate provisions in the process vent control requirements in Sec.  63.1425 by the dates specified in Sec.  63.1422 (the section describing compliance dates for sources subject to this subpart).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where the recalculated TRE index value is greater than 4.0, the owner or operator is not required to submit a report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Combination of process vents from batch unit operations and process vents from continuous unit operations.
