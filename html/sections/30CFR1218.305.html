If your lease has been  producing for less than 3 years, then use the average monthly royalty  payment for the entire period your lease has been producing  continuously;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ONRR must receive your advanced royalty payment before the  end of each full calendar month in which no production occurs;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may credit any advanced royalty you pay against production  royalties you owe after your lease resumes production.
