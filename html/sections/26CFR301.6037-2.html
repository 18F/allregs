                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Returns of electing small business corporation required on  magnetic media. An electing small business corporation required to file  an electing small business return on Form 1120S, ``U.S. Income Tax  Return for an S Corporation,'' under Sec. 1.6037-1 of this chapter must  file its Form 1120S on magnetic media if the small business corporation  is required by the Internal Revenue Code and regulations to file at  least 250 returns during the calendar year ending with or within its  taxable year. Returns filed on magnetic media must be made in accordance  with applicable revenue procedures, publications, forms, or  instructions. In prescribing revenue procedures, publications, forms, or  instructions, the Commissioner may direct the type of magnetic media  filing. (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver. The Commissioner may grant waivers of the requirements  of this section in cases of undue hardship. A request for waiver must be  made in accordance with applicable revenue procedures or publications.  The waiver also will be subject to the terms and conditions regarding  the method of filing as may be prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> (undue economic hardship related to filing information  returns on magnetic media) will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Meaning of terms. The following definitions apply for purposes  of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Magnetic media. The term magnetic media means any magnetic media  permitted under applicable regulations, revenue procedures, or  publications. These generally include magnetic tape, tape cartridge, and  diskette, as well as other media, such as electronic filing,  specifically permitted under the applicable regulations, procedures,  publications, forms, or instructions. (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this  chapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corporation. The term corporation means a corporation as defined  in section 7701(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Electing small business corporation return. The term electing  small business corporation return means a Form 1120S, ``U.S. Income Tax  Return for an S Corporation,'' along with all other related forms,  schedules, and statements that are required to be attached to the Form  1120S, and all members of the Form 1120S series of returns, including  amended and superseding returns.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Electing small business corporation. The term electing small  business corporation means an S corporation as defined in section  1361(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determination of 250 returns. For purposes of this section, a  corporation is required to file at least 250 returns if, during the  calendar year ending with or within the taxable year of the corporation,  the corporation is required to file at least 250 returns of any type,  including information returns (for example, Forms W-2, Forms 1099),  income tax returns, employment tax returns, and excise tax returns. In  the   case of a short year return, a corporation is required to file at least  250 returns if, during the calendar year which includes the short  taxable year of the corporation, the corporation is required to file at  least 250 returns of any type, including information returns (for  example, Forms W-2, Forms 1099), income tax returns, employment tax  returns, and excise tax returns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (d)(5) of this section. In the example, the corporation is a  calendar year taxpayer:</p><p class="depth2">Example. In 2007, Corporation S, an electing small business  corporation with assets in excess of $10 million, is required to file  one Form 1120S, ``U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return,'' 100 Forms W-2,  ``Wage and Tax Statement,'' 146 Forms 1099-DIV, ``Dividends and  Distributions,'' one Form 940, ``Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment  (FUTA) Tax Return,'' and four Forms 941, ``Employer's Quarterly Federal  Tax Return.'' Because S is required to file 252 returns during the  calendar year, S is required to file its 2007 Form 1120S electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability dates. This section applies to returns  of electing small business corporations that report total assets at the  end of the corporation's taxable year that equal or exceed $10 million  on Schedule L of Form 1120S for taxable years ending on or after  December 31, 2006, except for the application of the short year rules in  paragraph (d)(5) of this section, which is applicable for taxable years  ending on or after November 13, 2007.
