                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any party wishing to submit a claim against the liquidated  credit union must submit a written proof of claim in accordance with the  requirements set forth in the notice to creditors. A failure to submit a  written claim within the time provided in the notice to creditors shall  be deemed a waiver of said claim and claimant shall have no further  rights or remedies with respect to such claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the  liquidating agent may, at his discretion, consider an untimely claim  provide the following two criteria are present:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The claimant did not receive notice of the appointment of the  liquidating agent in time to file a claim before the date provided for  in the notice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The claim is filed in time to permit payment of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The liquidating agent may require submission of supplemental  evidence by the claimant and by interested parties in the event of a  dispute concerning a claim against any asset of the liquidated credit  union. In requiring the submission of supplemental evidence, the  liquidating agent may set such limitations of time, scope, and size as  the liquidating agent deems reasonable in the circumstances, and may   refuse to include in the record submissions or portions of submissions  not in compliance with such limitations or requirements. The liquidating  agent shall compile such written record of a claim or dispute as, in its  discretion, is deemed sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for  allowing or disallowing a claim or resolving a dispute. This written  record shall be considered the administrative record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The liquidating agent shall determine whether to allow or  disallow a claim and shall notify the claimant within 180 days from the  date a claim against a credit union is filed pursuant to paragraph  (a)(1) of the section. This 180-day period may be extended by written  agreement between the claimant and the liquidating agent. Failure by the  liquidating agent to determine a claim and notify the claimant within  the 180-day period or, if the period is extended, within the extended  period, shall be deemed a denial of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a claim or any portion thereof is disallowed, the notice to  the claimant shall contain a statement of the reasons for the  disallowance and an explanation of appeal rights pursuant to Sec. 709.7  of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of any determination with respect to a claim shall be  sufficient if mailed to the most recent address of the claimant which  appears:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the credit union's books;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the claim filed by the claimant; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the documents submitted in the proof of claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In the event the liquidating agent disallows all or part of a  claim, the liquidating agent shall file with the Board, or its  designated agent, a report of its determination. This report shall  become part of the record and shall include the notice to the claimant  and findings on all issues raised and decided by the liquidating agent.</p>
