In  determining the amount of security required, the factors that the Office  will consider include, but are not limited to, the operator's net worth,  the existence of a guarantee by a parent corporation, and the operator's  existing liability for benefits. The Office shall also consider such  other factors as it considers relevant to any particular case. The  amount of security which shall be required may be increased or decreased  when experience or changed conditions so warrant.</p>
