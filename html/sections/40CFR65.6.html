                                Sec. 65.6  Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and procedures.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to Group 2A  or Group 2B process vents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description and  purpose of plan. The owner or operator of a regulated source shall  develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that  describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the  regulated source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction  and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air  pollution control equipment used to comply with the relevant standard.  The plan shall also address routine or otherwise predictable CPMS  malfunctions. This plan shall be developed by the owner or operator by  the regulated source's implementation date as specified in Sec.  65.1(f), or for sources referenced from 40 CFR part 63, subpart F, by  the compliance date specified in that subpart. The requirement to  develop this plan shall be incorporated into the source's title V  permit. This requirement is optional for equipment that must comply with  subpart F of this part. It is not optional for equipment equipped with a  closed vent system and control device subject to subpart G of this part.  The purposes of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan are  described in the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct  malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence in order to  minimize excess emissions of regulated material (excess emissions are  defined in Sec. 65.3(a)(4)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of  startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to  restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to  its normal or usual manner of operation).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation of source. During periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction, the owner or operator of a regulated source shall operate  and maintain such source (including associated air pollution control  equipment and CPMS) in accordance with Sec. 65.3(a). The general duty  to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or  malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission  levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times  if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control  practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further  efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable   standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and  maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information  available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to,  monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures  (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section), review of operation and maintenance  records, and inspection of the source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of additional procedures. To satisfy the requirements of  this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the  owner or operator may use the regulated source's standard operating  procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet  all the requirements of this section and are made available for  inspection when requested by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Revisions to the plan. Based on the results of a determination  made under Sec. 65.3(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner  or operator of a regulated source make changes to the startup, shutdown,  and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require  reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if  the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as specified in the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of  the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the regulated source  that has occurred; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fails to provide for the operation of the regulated source  (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a  startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with  good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the  extent practical; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting  malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control equipment as quickly  as practicable; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize  excess emissions to the extent practical as specified and defined in  Sec. 65.3(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Additional malfunction plan requirements. If the startup,  shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately  addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but  was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the  time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator  shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days  after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and  maintaining the regulated source during similar malfunction events, and  a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or  air pollution control equipment or CPMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Retain plan on site. The current plan must be kept on site at  all times.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports. During the  reporting period, reports shall only be required for startup, shutdown,  and malfunction during which excess emissions as defined in Sec.  65.3(a)(4) occur. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction report can be  submitted as part of a periodic report required under Sec. 65.5(e), or  on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise in a relevant standard  or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the source's  title V permit. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be  delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each  calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate),  unless the information is submitted with the periodic report. The report  shall include the following information, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other  responsible official certifying its accuracy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of startup, shutdown, malfunction events and the  total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for  the reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup,  shutdown, and malfunction of a regulated source, or of a control device  or monitoring system required for compliance (including actions taken to  correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in  the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan,   then the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup,  shutdown, and malfunction report, and describe the actions taken. Such  description can take the form of a checklist; only one checklist is  necessary if actions taken are the same for multiple events during the  reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>, is not consistent with the procedures specified in the  regulated source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or  operator shall report the actions taken for that event as part of the  periodic report. The report shall explain the circumstances of the  event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and  malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter  monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred.
