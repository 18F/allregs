The Seashore District shall include all those  portions of the towns of Provincetown, Truro, Wellfleet, Eastham,  Orleans and Chatham lying within the exterior boundaries of the Cape Cod  National Seashore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Zoning bylaws for the Seashore District shall be consistent with  the objectives and purposes of the Act of August 7, 1961, so that--to  the extent possible under Massachusetts law--the scenic, scientific and  cultural values of the area will be protected, undeveloped areas will be  preserved in a natural condition, and the distinctive Cape Cod character  of existing residential structures will be maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No moving, alteration, or enlargement of existing one-family  residential dwellings or structures accessory thereto situated within  this District shall be permitted if such would afford less than a 50- foot setback from all streets measured at a right angle with the street  line, and a 25-foot distance from the abutters' property lines (or less  than such lesser setback or distance requirements already in existence  for such dwellings or accessory structures).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If through natural phenomena or causes a lot or lots are so  diminished in size that an owner would be unable to comply with the  setback or sideline requirements herein prescribed, such owner or the  zoning authorities may, as provided in Sec. 27.4(b), request the  Secretary of the Interior to determine whether a proposed move,  reconstruction, alteration of enlargement of an existing residential  dwelling or accessory structure would subject the property to  acquisition by condemnation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Zoning bylaws adopted pursuant to this regulation shall contain  provisions designed to preserve the seashore character of the area by  appropriate restrictions or prohibitions upon the burning of cover,  cutting of timber, filling of land, removal of soil, loam, sand or  gravel and dumping, storage, or piling of refuse and other unsightly  objects or other uses which would detract from the natural or  traditional seashore scene.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Zoning bylaws for the Seashore District may permit residential  uses of ``improved property'' and other uses of such dwellings and their  accessory structures: Provided, Such other uses are traditional to these  seashore communities, are customarily incidental to the principal  residential use and do not alter the essential character of the dwelling  and premises as a private residence. Subject to those conditions such  uses may include, but are not limited to: (1) Partial use of dwellings  by residents for a professional office (as for the practice of theology,  law or medicine), as an artists' studio, for appropriate small scale  home occupations as the making and selling of traditional Cape Cod  products produced on the premises, and for the rental of rooms and  serving of meals by residents of the premises to overnight guests; (2)  the existence of structures, such as a garage, barn or boathouse  accessory to the dwelling; (3) display of a sign which may be indirectly  but not directly illuminated and not to exceed two square feet in area,  referring to the occupancy, sale, or rental of the premises; (4)  traditional agricultural uses of cleared land, but not including such  objectionable uses as a piggery or the raising of livestock, poultry or  fur-bearing animals for commercial purposes; and (5) the opening of  shellfish, the storage and use of fishing equipment, and other  traditional fishing activities. No commercial or industrial ventures  (other than of the types described above), may be established within the  Seashore District.</p>
