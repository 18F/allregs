Both parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the complainant and the recipient agree, the mediator will prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it.

No mediator may testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The mediation proceeds for a maximum of 60 calendar days after a complaint is filed with GSA.
