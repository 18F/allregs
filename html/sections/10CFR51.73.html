                            <p class="depth0">Each draft environmental impact statement and each supplement to a  draft environmental impact statement distributed in accordance with  Sec. 51.74, and each news release provided pursuant to Sec. 51.74(d)  will be accompanied by or include a request for comments on the proposed  action and on the draft environmental impact statement or any supplement  to the draft environmental impact statement and will state where  comments should be submitted and the date on which the comment period  closes. A minimum comment period of 45 days will be provided. The  comment period will be calculated from the date on which the  Environmental Protection Agency notice stating that the draft statement  or the supplement to the draft statement has been filed with EPA is  published in the Federal Register. If no comments are provided within  the time specified, it will be presumed, unless the agency or person  requests an extension of time, that the agency or person has no comment  to make. To the extent practicable, NRC staff will grant reasonable  requests for extensions of time of up to fifteen (15) days.</p>
