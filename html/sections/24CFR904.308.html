                            <p class="depth0">The HBA and the homeowners association are, in legal terms, separate  and distinct organizations with different functions. The homeowners  association may hold title to and be responsible for maintenance of  common property (see Sec. Sec. 904.119 and 904.120), while the HBA has  more general service and representative functions. While all residents  are members of the HBA, only those who have acquired title to their  homes are members of the homeowners association.</p>
