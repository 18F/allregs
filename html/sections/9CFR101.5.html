                            <p class="depth0">Terms used when evaluating biological products shall mean:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standard Requirement. Test methods, procedures, and criteria  established by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for evaluating  biological products to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious, and not  to be worthless, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Log. Logarithm computed to the base 10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pure or purity. Quality of a biological product prepared to a  final form relatively free of extraneous micro-organisms and extraneous  material (organic or inorganic) as determined by test methods or  procedures established by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Standard Requirements or in the approved Outline of Production for such  product, but free of extraneous microorganisms or material which in the  opinion of the Administrator adversely affects the safety, potency, or  efficacy of such product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safe or safety. Freedom from properties causing undue local or  systemic reactions when used as recommended or suggested by the  manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sterile or sterility. Freedom from viable contaminating  microorganisms as demonstrated by procedures prescribed in part 113 of  this subchapter, Standard Requirements, and approved Outlines of  Production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Potent or potency. Relative strength of a biological product as  determined by test methods or procedures as established by Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service in Standard Requirements or in the  approved Outline of Production for such product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Efficacious or efficacy. Specific ability or capacity of the  biological product to effect the result for which it is offered when  used under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Dose. The amount of a biological product recommended on the  label to be given to one animal at one time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Vaccinate. An animal which has been inoculated, injected, or  otherwise administered a biological product being evaluated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Control animal. An animal, which may be referred to as a  control, used in a test procedure for purposes of comparison or to add  validity to the results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Day. Time elapsing between any regular working hour of one day  and any regular working hour of the following day.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Test results. Terms used to designate testing results are as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No Test. Designation used when a deficiency in the test system  has rendered a test unsuitable for drawing a valid conclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Satisfactory. Designation is a final conclusion given to a valid  test with results that meet the release criteria stated in the filed  Outline of Production or Standard Requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unsatisfactory. Designation is a final conclusion given to a  valid test with results that do not meet the release criteria stated in  the filed Outline of Production or Standard Requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inconclusive. Designation used for an initial test when a  sequential test design established in the filed Outline of Production or  Standard Requirement allows further testing if a valid initial test is  not satisfactory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Healthy. Apparently normal in all vital functions and free of  signs of disease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Unfavorable reactions. Overt adverse changes which occur in  healthy test animals subsequent to initiation of a test and manifested  during the observation period prescribed in the test protocol which are  attributable either to the biological product being tested or to factors  unrelated to such product as determined by the responsible individual  conducting the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Master reference. A Master Reference is a reference whose  potency is correlated, directly or indirectly, to host animal  immunogenicity. The Master Reference may be used as the working  reference in in vitro tests for relative potency. The Master Reference  may also be used to establish the relative potency of a serial of  product used in requalification studies and to establish the relative  potency of working references. The preparation of a Master Reference as  described in a filed Outline of Production may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A completed serial of vaccine or bacterin prepared in accordance  with a filed Outline of Production;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A purified preparation of a protective immunogen or antigen; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A nonadjuvanted harvested culture of microorganisms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Working reference. A Working Reference is the reference  preparation that is used in the in vitro test for the release of serials  of product. Working References may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Master References; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Serials of product that have been prepared and qualified, in a  manner acceptable to Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for use  as reference preparations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Qualifying serial. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A serial of biological product used to  test for immunogenicity when the Master or Working Reference is a  purified antigen or nonadjuvanted harvest material. Qualifying serials  shall be produced in accordance with the filed Outline of Production,  tested for immunogenicity in accordance with methods deemed appropriate  by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and have a geometric  mean relative potency, when compared to the Master Reference, of not  greater than 1.0 as established by: independent parallel line assays  with five or more replicates; or other valid assay methods for  determining relative antigen content which demonstrate linearity,  specificity, and reproducibility at least equivalent to the parallel  line assay and are acceptable to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Qualifying serials used to requalify or extend the dating period  of a Master Reference shall be determined to be immunogenic in  accordance with methods deemed appropriate by the Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section, and, in addition, shall be within their permitted dating period  and have been prepared in accordance with the production method  described in the currently filed Outline of Production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Immunogenicity. The ability of a biological product to elicit an  immune response in animals as determined by test methods or procedures  acceptable to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
