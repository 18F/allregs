                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Separate the PBP&E; and have the HHG carrier estimate the weight of the PBP&E; before the HHG shipment is picked up. Subtract 110 percent of the estimated PBP&E; weight (to adjust for packing materials) from the estimated gross weight as shown on the shipping documents (i.e., net weight minus the PBP&E; minus 10 percent of the PBP&E;). If the result is more than the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you did not discover that the HHG shipment exceeded the net weight allowance in advance, and if you did not weigh or estimate the PBP&E; before shipping it, then weigh the PBP&E; before it is delivered. Determine if the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance by applying the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment does not exceed the net weight allowance, then the agency may transport and pay for shipping the PBP&E; plus packing materials with the household goods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> However, if the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment may exceed the net weight allowance, and if the employee was authorized PBP&E;, then the employee must pay for shipping all weight that exceeds the net weight allowance for their HHG, minus the PBP&E; and packing materials for both. The agency may then pay for shipping the PBP&E; as an administrative expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The agency may require reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&E; and the weight of the PBP&E.;
