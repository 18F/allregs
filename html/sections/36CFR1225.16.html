                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. Federal agencies request authority to dispose of records, either immediately or on a recurring basis. Requests for immediate disposal are limited to existing records that no longer accumulate. For recurring records, approved schedules provide continuing authority to destroy the

records. The retention periods approved by NARA are mandatory, and the agency must dispose of the records after expiration of the retention period, except as provided in Sec. Sec. 1226.18 and 1226.20 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. Each item on an SF 115 proposed for eventual destruction must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Descriptive title familiar to agency personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Description of the records including agency function, physical type(s) and informational content;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disposition instructions developed using the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the record series, component of an electronic information system, or appropriate aggregation of series and/or automated system components is current and continuing, the SF 115 must include file breaks, retention period or event after which the records will be destroyed, and, if appropriate, transfer period for retiring inactive records to an approved records storage facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the records series, system, or other aggregation is nonrecurring, i.e., no additional records will be created or acquired, the SF 115 must specify either immediate destruction or destruction on a future date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination. If NARA determines that the proposed disposition is not consistent with the value of the records, it will request that the agency make appropriate changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If NARA determines that records proposed as temporary merit permanent retention and transfer to the National Archives of the United States, the agency must change the disposition instruction prior to approval of the SF 115.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If NARA and the agency cannot agree on the retention period for an item(s), the items(s) will be withdrawn. In these cases, the agency must submit an SF 115 with a revised proposal for disposition; unscheduled records must be treated as permanent until a new schedule is approved.</p>
