If  the actuarial gain or loss determined for a cost accounting period is  not material, the entire gain or loss may be included as a component of  the current or ensuing year's pension cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pension plan terminations and curtailments of benefits shall be  subject to adjustment in accordance with 9904.413-50(c)(12).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuation of the assets of a pension plan. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The actuarial  value of the assets of a pension plan shall be used:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In measuring actuarial gains and losses, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of measuring other components of pension cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan may be  determined by the use of any recognized asset valuation method which  provides equivalent recognition of appreciation and depreciation of the  market value of the assets of the pension plan. However, the actuarial  value of the assets produced by the method used shall fall within a  corridor from 80 to 120 percent of the market value of the assets,  determined as of the valuation date. If the method produces a value that  falls outside the corridor, the actuarial value of the assets shall be  adjusted to equal the nearest boundary of the corridor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The method selected for valuing pension plan assets shall be  consistently applied from year to year within each plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this  subsection are not applicable to plans that are treated as defined- contribution plans in accordance with 9904.412-50(a)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The market and actuarial values of the assets of a pension plan  shall not be adjusted for any fee, reserve charge, or other investment  charge for withdrawals from or termination of an investment contract,  trust agreement, or other funding arrangement, unless such fee is  determined in an arm's length transaction, and actually incurred and  paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The market value of the assets of a pension plan shall include  the present value of contributions received after the date the market  value of plan assets is measured.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The assumed rate of interest, established in accordance with  9904.412-40(b)(2) and 9904.412-50(b)(4), shall be used to determine the  present value of   such receivable contributions as of the valuation date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The market value of plan assets measured in accordance with  paragraphs (b)(6)(i) of this section shall be the basis for measuring  the actuarial value of plan assets in accordance with this Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allocation of pension cost to segments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For contractors who  compute a composite pension cost covering plan participants in two or  more segments, the base to be used for allocating such costs shall be  representative of the factors on which the pension benefits are based.  For example, a base consisting of salaries and wages shall be used for  pension costs that are calculated as a percentage of salaries and wages;  a base consisting of the number of participants shall be used for  pension costs that are calculated as an amount per participant. If  pension costs are separately calculated for one or more segments, the  contractor shall make a distribution among the segments for the maximum  tax-deductible amount and the contribution to the funding agency as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When apportioning to the segments the sum of (A) the maximum  tax-deductible amount, which is determined for a qualified defined- benefit pension plan as a whole pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code at  Title 26 of the U.S. C., as amended, and (B) the accumulated value of  the prepayment credits not already allocated to segments, the contractor  shall use a base that considers the otherwise assignable pension costs  or the funding levels of the individual segments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When apportioning amounts deposited to a funding agency to  segments, contractors shall use a base that is representative of the  assignable pension costs, determined in accordance with 9904.412-50(c)  for the individual segments. However, for qualified defined-benefit  pension plans, the contractor may first apportion amounts funded to the  segment or segments subject to this Standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Separate pension cost for a segment shall be calculated whenever  any of the following conditions exist for that segment, provided that  such condition(s) materially affect the amount of pension cost allocated  to the segment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is a material termination of employment gain or loss  attributable to the segment,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The level of benefits, eligibility for benefits, or age  distribution is materially different for the segment than for the  average of all segments, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The appropriate actuarial assumptions are, in the aggregate,  materially different for the segment than for the average of all  segments. Calculations of termination of employment gains and losses  shall give consideration to factors such as unexpected early  retirements, benefits becoming fully vested, and reinstatements or  transfers without loss of benefits. An amount may be estimated for  future reemployments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pension cost shall also be separately calculated for a segment  under circumstances where--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pension plan for that segment becomes merged with that of  another segment, or the pension plan is divided into two or more pension  plans, and in either case,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The ratios of market value of the assets to actuarial accrued  liabilities for each of the merged or separated plans are materially  different from one another after applying the benefits in effect after  the pension plan merger or pension plan division.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For a segment whose pension costs are required to be calculated  separately pursuant to paragraphs (c) (2) or (3) of this subsection,  such calculations shall be prospective only; pension costs need not be  redetermined for prior years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For a segment whose pension costs are either required to be  calculated separately pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this  subsection or calculated separately at the election of the contractor,  there shall be an initial allocation of a share in the undivided market  value of the assets of the pension plan to that segment, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the necessary data are readily determinable, the funding  agency balance to be allocated to the segment shall be the amount  contributed by, or on behalf of, the segment, increased by   income received on such assets, and decreased by benefits and expenses  paid from such assets. Likewise, the accumulated value of permitted  unfunded accruals to be allocated to the segment shall be the amount of  permitted unfunded accruals assigned to the segment, increased by  interest imputed to such assets, and decreased by benefits paid from  sources other than the funding agency; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the data specified in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this subsection  are not readily determinable for certain prior periods, the market value  of the assets of the pension plan shall be allocated to the segment as  of the earliest date such data are available. Such allocation shall be  based on the ratio of the actuarial accrued liability of the segment to  the plan as a whole, determined in a manner consistent with the  immediate gain actuarial cost method or methods used to compute pension  cost. Such assets shall be brought forward as described in paragraph  (c)(7) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The actuarial value of the assets of the pension plan shall be  allocated to the segment in the same proportion as the market value of  the assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If, prior to the time a contractor is required to use this  Standard, it has been calculating pension cost separately for individual  segments, the amount of assets previously allocated to those segments  need not be changed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> After the initial allocation of assets, the contractor shall  maintain a record of the portion of subsequent contributions, permitted  unfunded accruals, income, benefit payments, and expenses attributable  to the segment, and paid from the assets of the pension plan. Income  shall include a portion of any investment gains and losses attributable  to the assets of the pension plan. Income and expenses of the pension  plan assets shall be allocated to the segment in the same proportion  that the average value of assets allocated to the segment bears to the  average value of total pension plan assets, including the accumulated  value of prepayment credits, for the period for which income and  expenses are being allocated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If plan participants transfer among segments, contractors need  not transfer assets or actuarial accrued liabilities, unless a transfer  is sufficiently large to distort the segment's ratio of pension plan  assets to actuarial accrued liabilities determined using the accrued  benefit cost method. If assets and liabilities are transferred, the  amount of assets transferred shall be equal to the actuarial accrued  liabilities transferred, determined using the accrued benefit cost  method and long-term assumptions in accordance with 9904.412-40(b)(2)  and 9904.412-50(b)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Contractors who separately calculate the pension cost of one or  more segments may calculate such cost either for all pension plan  participants assignable to the segment(s) or for only the active  participants of the segment(s). If costs are calculated only for active  participants, a separate segment shall be created for all of the  inactive participants of the pension plan and the cost thereof shall be  calculated. When a contractor makes such an election, assets shall be  allocated to the segment for inactive participants in accordance with  paragraphs (c)(5), (6), and (7) of this subsection. When an employee of  a segment becomes inactive, assets shall be transferred from that  segment to the segment established to accumulate the assets and  actuarial liabilities for the inactive plan participants. The amount of  assets transferred shall be equal to the actuarial accrued liabilities,  determined under the accrued benefit cost method and long-term  assumptions in accordance with 9904.412-40(b)(2) and 9904.412-50(b)(4),  for these inactive plan participants. If inactive participants become  active, assets and liabilities shall similarly be transferred to the  segments to which the participants are assigned. Such transfers need be  made only as of the last day of a cost accounting period. The total  annual pension cost for a segment having active employees shall be the  amount calculated for the segment and an allocated portion of the  pension cost calculated for the inactive participants. Such an  allocation shall be on the same basis as that set forth in paragraph  (c)(1) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Where pension cost is separately calculated for one or more  segments,   the actuarial cost method used for a plan shall be the same for all  segments. Unless a separate calculation of pension cost for a segment is  made because of a condition set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this  subsection, the same actuarial assumptions may be used for all segments  covered by a plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> If a pension plan has participants in the home office of a  company, the home office shall be treated as a segment for purposes of  allocating the cost of the pension plan. Pension cost allocated to a  home office shall be a part of the costs to be allocated in accordance  with the appropriate requirements of Cost Accounting Standard 9904.403.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> If a segment is closed, if there is a pension plan termination,  or if there is a curtailment of benefits, the contractor shall determine  the difference between the actuarial accrued liability for the segment  and the market value of the assets allocated to the segment,  irrespective of whether or not the pension plan is terminated. The  difference between the market value of the assets and the actuarial  accrued liability for the segment represents an adjustment of  previously-determined pension costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The determination of the actuarial accrued liability shall be  made using the accrued benefit cost method. The actuarial assumptions  employed shall be consistent with the current and prior long term  assumptions used in the measurement of pension costs. If there is a  pension plan termination, the actuarial accrued liability shall be  measured as the amount paid to irrevocably settle all benefit  obligations or paid to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> of this subsection. The market value of  the assets shall be reduced by the accumulated value of prepayment  credits, if any. Conversely, the market value of the assets shall be  increased by the current value of any unfunded actuarial liability  separately identified and maintained in accordance with 9904.412- 50(a)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The calculation of the difference between the market value of  the assets and the actuarial accrued liability shall be made as of the  date of the event (e.g., contract termination, plan amendment, plant  closure) that caused the closing of the segment, pension plan  termination, or curtailment of benefits. If such a date is not readily  determinable, or if its use can result in an inequitable calculation,  the contracting parties shall agree on an appropriate date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Pension plan improvements adopted within 60 months of the date  of the event which increase the actuarial accrued liability shall be  recognized on a prorata basis using the number of months the date of  adoption preceded the event date. Plan improvements mandated by law or  collective bargaining agreement are not subject to this phase-in.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If a segment is closed due to a sale or other transfer of  ownership to a successor in interest in the contracts of the segment and  all of the pension plan assets and actuarial accrued liabilities  pertaining to the closed segment are transferred to the successor  segment, then no adjustment amount pursuant to this paragraph (c)(12) is  required. If only some of the pension plan assets and actuarial accrued  liabilities of the closed segment are transferred, then the adjustment  amount required under this paragraph (c)(12) shall be determined based  on the pension plan assets and actuarial accrued liabilities remaining  with the contractor. In either case, the effect of the transferred  assets and liabilities is carried forward and recognized in the  accounting for pension cost at the successor contractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Government's share of the adjustment amount determined for  a segment shall be the product of the adjustment amount and a fraction.  The adjustment amount shall be reduced for any excise tax imposed upon  assets withdrawn from the funding agency of a qualified pension plan.  The numerator of such fraction shall be the sum of the pension plan  costs allocated to all contracts and subcontracts (including Foreign  Military Sales) subject to this Standard during a period of years  representative of the Government's   participation in the pension plan. The denominator of such fraction  shall be the total pension costs assigned to cost accounting periods  during those same years. This amount shall represent an adjustment of  contract prices or cost allowance as appropriate. The adjustment may be  recognized by modifying a single contract, several but not all  contracts, or all contracts, or by use of any other suitable technique.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The full amount of the Government's share of an adjustment is  allocable, without limit, as a credit or charge during the cost  accounting period in which the event occurred and contract prices/costs  will be adjusted accordingly. However, if the contractor continues to  perform Government contracts, the contracting parties may negotiate an  amortization schedule, including interest adjustments. Any amortization  agreement shall consider the magnitude of the adjustment credit or  charge, and the size and nature of the continuing contracts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> If a benefit curtailment is caused by a cessation of benefit  accruals mandated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq., as amended based on the plan's funding  level, then no adjustment for the curtailment of benefit pursuant to  this paragraph (c)(12) is required. Instead, the curtailment of benefits  shall be recognized as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If the written plan document provides that benefit accruals are  nonforfeitable once employment service has been rendered, and shall be  retroactively restored if, and when, the benefit accrual limitation  ceases, then the contractor may elect to recognize the expected benefit  accruals in the actuarial accrued liability and normal cost during the  period of cessation for the determination of pension cost in accordance  with the provisions of 9904-412 and 413.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Otherwise, the curtailment of benefits shall be recognized as an  actuarial gain or loss for the period. The subsequent restoration of  missed benefit accruals shall be recognized as an actuarial gain or loss  in the period in which the restoration occurs.  [60 FR 16550, Mar. 30, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 81323, Dec. 27, 2011]</p>
