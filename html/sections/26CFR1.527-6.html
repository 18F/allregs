                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exempt organizations--General rule. If an organization described in section 501(c) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) expends any amount for an exempt function, it may be subject to tax. There is included in the gross income of such organization for the taxable year an amount equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The net investment income of such organization for the taxable year, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The aggregate amount expended during the taxable year for an exempt function.
The amount included will be treated as political organization taxable income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exempt function expenditures--(1) Directly related expenses. (i) Except as provided in this section, the term exempt function will generally have the same meaning it has in Sec. 1.527-2(c). Thus, expenditures which are directly related to the selection process as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)(1) are expenditures for an exempt function. Expenditures for indirect expenses as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)(2), when made by a section 501(c) organization are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Expenditures of a section 501 (c) organization which are otherwise allowable under the Federal Election Campaign Act or similar State statute are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directly related expenses. (i) Except as provided in this section, the term exempt function will generally have the same meaning it has in Sec. 1.527-2(c). Thus, expenditures which are directly related to the selection process as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)(1) are expenditures for an exempt function. Expenditures for indirect expenses as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)(2), when made by a section 501(c) organization are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Expenditures of a section 501 (c) organization which are otherwise allowable under the Federal Election Campaign Act or similar State statute are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in this section, the term exempt function will generally have the same meaning it has in Sec. 1.527-2(c). Thus, expenditures which are directly related to the selection process as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)(1) are expenditures for an exempt function. Expenditures for indirect expenses as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)(2), when made by a section 501(c) organization are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Expenditures of a section 501 (c) organization which are otherwise allowable under the Federal Election Campaign Act or similar State statute are for an exempt function only to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An expenditure may be made for an exempt function directly or through another organization. A section 501(c) organization will not be absolutely liable under section 527(f)(1) for amounts transferred to an individual or organization. A section 501(c) organization is, however, required to take reasonable steps to ensure that the transferee does not use such amounts for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Indirect expenses. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expenditures allowed by Federal Election Campaign Act. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appointments or confirmations. Where an organization described in paragraph (a) of this section appears before any legislative body in response to a written request by such body for the purpose of influencing the appointment or confirmation of an individual to a public office, any expenditure directly related to such appearance is not treated as an expenditure for an exempt function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nonpartisan activity. Expenditures for nonpartisan activities by an organization to which paragraph (a) of this section applies are not expenditures for an exempt function. Nonpartisan activities include voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns. To be nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns must not be specifically identified by the organization with any candidate or political party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Character of items included in gross income--(1) General rule. The items of income included in the gross income of an organization under paragraph (a) of this section retain their character as ordinary income or capital gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The items of income included in the gross income of an organization under paragraph (a) of this section retain their character as ordinary income or capital gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule in determining character of item. If the amount included in gross income is determined under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the character of the items of income is determined by multiplying the total amount included in gross income under such paragraph by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the organization's net investment income that is gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, and the denominator of which is the organization's net investment income. For example, if $5,000 is included in the gross income of an organization under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the organization had $100,000 of net investment income of which $10,000 is long term capital gain, then $500 would be treated as long term capital gain:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08OC91.002</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Modifications. The modifications described in section 527(c)(2) apply in computing the tax under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Thus, no net operating loss is allowed under section 172 nor is any deduction allowed under part VIII of subchapter B. However, there is allowed a specific deduction of $100.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transfer not treated as exempt function expenditures. Provided the provisions of this paragraph (e) are met, a transfer of political contributions or dues collected by a section 501(c) organization to a separate segregated fund as defined in paragraph (f) of this section is not treated as an expenditure for an exempt function (within the meaning of Sec. 1.527-2(c)). Such transfers must be made promptly after the receipt of such amounts by the section 501(c) organization, and must be made directly to the separate segregated fund. A transfer is considered promptly and directly made if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The procedures followed by the section 501(c) organization satisfy the requirements of applicable Federal or State campaign law and regulations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The section 501(c) organization maintains adequate records to demonstrate that amounts transferred in fact consist of political contributions or dues, rather than investment income; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The political contributions or dues transferred were not used to earn investment income for the section 501(c) organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Separate segregated fund. An organization or fund described in section 527(f)(3) is a separate segregated fund.

To avoid the application of paragraph (a) of this section, an organization described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) may, if it is consistent with its exempt status, establish and maintain such a separate segregated fund to receive contributions and make expenditures in a political campaign. If such a fund meets the requirements of Sec. 1.527-2(a) (relating to the definition of a political organization), it shall be treated as a political organization subject to the provisions of section 527. A segregated fund established under the Federal Election Campaign Act will continue to be treated as a segregated fund when it engages in exempt function activities as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c), relating to State campaigns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effect of expenditures on exempt status. Section 527(f) and this section do not sanction the intervention in any political campaign by an organization described in section 501(c) if such activity is inconsistent with its exempt status under section 501(c). For example, an organization described in section 501(c)(3) is precluded from engaging in any political campaign activities. The fact that section 527 imposes a tax on the exempt function (as defined in Sec. 1.527-2(c)) expenditures of section 501(c) organizations and permits such organizations to establish separate segregated funds to engage in campaign activities does not sanction the participation in these activities by section 501(c)(3) organizations.
