Applicants also must be capable of carrying out the work of the Corps for the estimated duration of their enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Candidate recruitment and referral: (1) Interested youth may apply to their local Employment Service/Job Service for enrollment. State Employment Security Agencies (SESA) and their local Employment Service/Job Service (ES/JS) offices shall take applications for YACC from all interested youth and shall refer all candidates who self-certify that they meet eligibility requirements to Grantees for selection of those to be enrolled. Self-certification by applicants ages 16 through 18 who have left school shall include an assurance that they did not leave school for the purpose of enrolling in the Corps.

Preference in enrollee selection shall be given to applicants in rural and urban areas having substantial unemployment rates equal to or in excess of 6.5 per centum as determined by the Department of Labor. Grantees shall comply with section 808 of the act, concerning antidiscrimination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Enrollment duration: (1) Grantees shall assure that no individual is enrolled in the Corps for a total period of more than 12 months.

Grantees shall assure that work project activities on which YACC enrollees are employed are consistent with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resource Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Enrollees will be assigned to work projects which are designed to diminish the backlog of work in such fields as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tree nursery operations, planting, pruning, thinning and other silvicultural measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wildlife habitat improvement and preservation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Range management improvements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Recreation development, rehabilitation and maintenance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fish habitat and culture measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Forest insect and disease prevention and control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Road and trail maintenance and improvements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> General sanitation, cleanup, and maintenance and improvements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Erosion control and flood damage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Drought damage measures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Other natural disaster damage measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Project criteria.

with educational systems, CETA and other employment and training programs, employment service offices, local apprenticeship sponsors and information centers, and employers, in order to arrange for the provision of available services to enrollees, both during non-work hours while enrolled, and after termination from YACC. Grantees shall establish procedures to ensure that enrollees are made aware of established linkages and related information and opportunities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grantees shall notify appropriate local ES/JS offices regarding enrollee status, in advance of the end of the enrollment period or upon termination and shall, to the extent feasible, assist the enrollee in making contact with ES/JS or other organizations to enhance the possibilities for placement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Labor shall work with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to make suitable arrangements whereby academic credit may be awarded by educational institutions and agencies for competencies derived from work experience obtained through the YACC program. Labor shall also encourage Grantees, through Interior and Forest Service, to make necessary arrangements with local education agencies so that academic credit for such work experience may be granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Enrollee wages and hours of work: (1) Grantees shall assure that enrollees in the State Grant Program are paid at the Federal minimum wage rate specified in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. As an exception, Grantees shall provide for an additional cost-of-living adjustment for enrollees in the State of Alaska, not to exceed 25 percent of the Federal Wage Rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wages in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas shall be consistent with provisions of Federal, State, or local laws, otherwise applicable. Wages in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall be consistent with local law, except on Eniwetok and Kwajalein Atoll where section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As an incentive, Grantees may authorize incremental increases, above the minimum wage, for a limited number of enrollees, to reflect additional responsibilities or competencies. For this purpose, two promotional categories may be established: (i) Enrollee Leader, and (ii) Enrollee Assistant Leader. No more than 15 percent of the enrollment of any individual camp or project shall be given such increases. For each enrollee thus compensated, the wage increase shall be 50 percent for the enrollee leader and 15 percent for the enrollee assistant leader, of the applicable basic hourly minimum wage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Grantees shall reduce enrollee wages for each hour of unexcused absence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Enrollees assigned to residential camps may be required to assume responsibility for housekeeping and maintenance duties. Such duties shall not be considered compensable, unless scheduled during the regular work day, in which case enrollees shall be paid at the same rate as for regular work assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Enrollees may not be required to work more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week, except that Grantees may authorize overtime which shall not exceed 10 hours per week per enrollee, in which event they shall pay them at his or her regular rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Enrollees assigned to residential camps shall be charged for daily food and lodging as follows: 75 cents per meal furnished and 75 cents per day lodging.

State and local grantees shall utilize the payroll forms used by the Federal Government for payment of enrollees in accordance with the guidelines issued by Forest Service and Interior as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Grantees may utilize the payroll services of the Administrative Service Center (ASC), Bureau of Reclamation, P.O. Box 11568, Salt Lake City, Utah 84147 for enrollee pay at no direct cost to the Grantee. Grantees may elect to payroll the enrollees through their own payroll system if the payroll system is consistent with regulations contained herein.

Accrued leave may be used for such purposes as personal business and sick time. The date of formal termination shall be the final date upon which the youth is eligible to receive pay, whether this is a work day or an accrued but unused leave day. Compensation shall not be paid for unused accrued leave.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grantees may grant administrative leave with pay for enrollee participation in job search and employment development activities.
