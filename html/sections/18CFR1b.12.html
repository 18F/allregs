A witness who has given testimony in an investigation shall be entitled, upon written request, to procure a transcript of the witness' own testimony on payment of the appropriate fees, except that in a non-public formal investigation, the office responsible for the investigation may for good cause deny such request. In any event, any witness or his counsel, upon proper identification, shall have the right to inspect the official transcript of the witness' own testimony.
