Agencies may choose to adopt existing quality guidelines such as those developed

by the American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA) or other state highway agencies. \1\ A level of inspection necessary to provide ongoing compliance with the quality guidelines shall be provided.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The American Traffic Safety Services Association's (ATSSA) Quality Guidelines for Work Zone Traffic Control Devices uses photos and written descriptions to help judge when a traffic control device has outlived its usefulness. These guidelines are available for purchase from ATSSA through the following URL: http://www.atssa.com/store/bc--item--detail.jsp?productId=1. Similar guidelines are available from various State highway agencies. The Illinois Department of Transportation ``Quality Standards for Work Zone Traffic Control Devices'' is available online at http://dot.state.il.us/workzone/wztcd2004r.pdf.
