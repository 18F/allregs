It is not appropriate to establish a rigid formula or to assign predetermined weight to each factor. The identification of some of the elements is to guide the OSHA staff and inform the public on the development of priorities. It is not intended to create any legal rights with respect to the setting of priorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Some factors which may be taken into account in setting priorities for regulating potential occupational carcinogens, when such data are available, are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The estimated number of workers exposed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated levels of human exposure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The levels of exposure to the substance which have been reported to cause an increased incidence of neoplasms in exposed humans, animals or both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The extent to which regulatory action could reduce not only risks of contracting cancer but also other occupational and environmental health hazards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the molecular structure of the substance is similar to the molecular structure of another substance which meets the definition of a potential occupational carcinogen;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether there are substitutes that pose a lower risk of cancer or other serious human health problems, or available evidence otherwise suggests that the social and economic costs of regulation would be small; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> OSHA will also consider its responsibilities for dealing with other health and safety hazards and will consider the actions being taken or planned by other governmental agencies in dealing with the same or similar health and safety hazards.</p>
