Removal of waste, such as clam and oyster shells, operation of processing and packing machinery, and providing steam and brine for the processing operations (see Mitchell v. Trade Winds Inc., 289 F. 2d 278, explaining Waller v. Humphreys, 133 F. 2d 193) are also included. As for the application of the exemption to office, maintenance, warehouse, and other employees, see the discussion in Sec. 784.106 et seq., and Sec. Sec. 784.140 and 784.141.</p>
