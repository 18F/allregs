                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Advisory opinion. Any person desiring information as to whether  the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls would be likely to grant a  license or other approval for the export or approval of a particular  defense article or defense service to a particular country may request  an advisory opinion from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.  Advisory opinions are issued on a case-by-case basis and apply only to  the particular matters presented to the Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls. These opinions are not binding on the Department of State, and  may not be used in future matters before the Department. A request for  an advisory opinion must be made in writing and must outline in detail  the equipment, its usage, the security classification (if any) of the  articles or related technical data, and the country or countries  involved. An original and seven copies of the letter must be provided  along with seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning  the defense article or defense service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Related authorizations. The Directorate of Defense Trade  Controls may, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedures set  forth in paragraph (a) of this section, provide export authorization,  subject to all other relevant requirements of this subchapter, both for  transactions that have been the subject of advisory opinions requested  by prospective U.S. exporters, or for the Directorate's own initiatives.  Such initiatives may cover pilot programs, or specifically anticipated  circumstances for which the Directorate considers special authorizations  appropriate.  [71 FR 20547, Apr. 21, 2006]</p>
