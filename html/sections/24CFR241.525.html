If an application is rejected before it is assigned for processing, or in such other instances as the Commissioner may determine, the entire application and commitment fees or any portion thereof may be returned to the applicant. Commitment, inspection, and reopening fees may be refunded, in whole or in part if it is determined by the Commissioner that the installation of energy conserving improvements for the project has been prevented because of condemnation proceedings or other legal action taken by a governmental body or public agency, or in such other instances as the Commissioner may determine.</p>
