                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insured state nonmember banks. An insured state nonmember bank  shall give the FDIC written notice, as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of  this section, at least 30 days prior to adding or replacing any member  of its board of directors, employing any person as a senior executive  officer of the bank, or changing the responsibilities of any senior  executive officer so that the person would assume a different senior  executive officer position, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The bank is not in compliance with all minimum capital  requirements applicable to the bank as determined on the basis of the  bank's most   recent report of condition or report of examination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bank is in troubled condition; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FDIC determines, in connection with its review of a capital  restoration plan required under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act (12  U.S.C. 1831o(e)(2)) or otherwise, that such notice is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Insured branches of foreign banks. In the case of the addition  of a member of the board of directors or a change in senior executive  officer in a foreign bank having an insured state branch, the notice  requirement shall not apply to such additions and changes in the foreign  bank parent, but only to changes in senior executive officers in the  state branch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiver of prior notice--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Waiver requests. The FDIC may permit  an individual, upon petition by the bank to the appropriate FDIC office,  to serve as a senior executive officer or director before filing the  notice required under this subpart if the FDIC finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Delay would threaten the safety or soundness of the bank;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Delay would not be in the public interest; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other extraordinary circumstances exist that justify waiver of  prior notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Automatic waiver. In the case of the election of a new director  not proposed by management at a meeting of the shareholders of an  insured state nonmember bank, the prior 30-day notice is automatically  waived and the individual immediately may begin serving, provided that a  complete notice is filed with the appropriate FDIC office within two  business days after the individual's election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect on disapproval authority. A waiver shall not affect the  authority of the FDIC to disapprove a notice within 30 days after a  waiver is granted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or the election  of an individual who has filed a notice and is serving pursuant to an  automatic waiver under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Content of filing. The notice required by paragraph (a) of  this section shall be filed with the appropriate FDIC office and shall  contain information pertaining to the competence, experience, character,  or integrity of the individual with respect to whom the notice is  submitted, as prescribed in the designated interagency form which is  available from any FDIC regional director. The FDIC may require  additional information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modification. The FDIC may modify or accept other information in  place of the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for a  notice filed under this subpart.</p>
