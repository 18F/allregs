                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NIST has developed instrumentation and techniques for realizing  standards for the seven base units of the International System of Units,  as agreed upon by the General Conference of Weights and Measures.  Reference standards have been established not only for these seven base  units, but also for many derived quantities and their multiples and  submultiples. Such reference standards, or equivalent working standards,  are used to calibrate laboratory and plant standards for other  organizations. Accuracy is maintained by stability checks, by comparison  with the standards of other national and international laboratories, and  by the exploration of alternative techniques as a means of reducing  possible systematic error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calibrations for many types of instruments and ranges of  physical quantities are described in the NIST Special Publication 250  (SP 250). (See Sec. 200.115 for details relating to the description of  service items and listing of fees.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In recent years NIST has offered to the public new measurement  services called measurement assurance programs. These programs are  designed for laboratories whose measurement process involves the  calibration of other standards. A measurement assurance program is a  measurement quality control process. By use of carefully designed  redundant measurements and measurements made on NIST transport standards  a total uncertainty of the laboratories measurement process can be  determined by NIST. The results of these tests are then reported to the  customer as uncertainties of the customer's measurements relative to  national standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special measurements not listed in SP 250 may be made upon  request. These might involve unusual physical quantities, upper or lower  extremes of range, higher levels of accuracy, fast response speeds,  short durations, broader ranges of associated parameters, or special  environmental conditions. Such inquiries should describe clearly the  measurement desired. Indication of the scientific or economic basis for  the requirements to be satisfied will be helpful in determining future  NIST programs. Fees for work accepted will be based upon actual costs  incurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The principal emphasis of NIST is on those calibrations and  other tests requiring such accuracy as can be obtained only by direct  comparison with its standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other services which may be obtained include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tests of measuring instruments to determine compliance with  specifications or claims, when the evaluation is critical in national  scientific or technical operations, and when suitable facilities are not  available elsewhere; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referee tests in important cases when clients are unable to  agree upon the method of measurement, the results of tests, or the  interpretation of these results, but have agreed in advance in writing  to accept and abide by the findings of NIST.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> NIST reserves the right to decline any request for services if  the work would interfere with other activities deemed by the Director to  be of greater importance. In general, measurement services are not  provided when available from commercial laboratories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Suggestions will be offered on measurement techniques and on  other sources of assistance on calibration or measurement problems when  the equipment and personnel of NIST are unable to undertake the work.  The National Conference of Standards Laboratories issues a Directory of  Standards Laboratories in the United States which perform calibration  work (obtainable from NCSL Secretariat, c/o National Institute of  Standards & Technology, Boulder, CO 80303). Those laboratories which  perform testing are listed in the ASTM Directory of Testing  Laboratories, Commercial and Institutional. (Directory available from  the   Amercian Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street,  Philadelphia, PA 19103.) Similar listings appear in buyer's guides for  commercial products and in technical journals concerned with physical  measurement.</p>
