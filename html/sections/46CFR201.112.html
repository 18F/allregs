The testimony shall be taken stenographically, shall be translated to English, if necessary, and shall be transcribed unless the parties agree otherwise. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objections to the proceedings, shall be noted by the officer upon the

deposition. Any party served with a notice to take an oral deposition may cross-examine a witness whose testimony is taken under such deposition. In lieu of cross-examination, parties served with notice of taking a deposition may transmit written interrogatories or cross-interrogatories to the officer taking the deposition, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim together with any objections interposed thereto by adverse parties.</p>
