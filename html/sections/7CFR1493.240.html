Include in the statement the share of private sector ownership of the project;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(25)</em> The exporter's signature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application fee. The exporter shall pay the application fee specified in the program announcement at the time the application is submitted. An application will not be considered without payment of the specified fee. The application fee is nonrefundable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Letter of preliminary commitment. CCC will determine whether, in its judgment, the project in connection with which the exporter seeks a facility payment guarantee is likely to increase exports of U.S. agricultural commodities or products to an emerging market; and whether the project is likely to benefit primarily U.S. agricultural commodities or products as opposed to commodities or products originating in other countries. If necessary, CCC may seek additional information from an applicant prior to making its determination. If CCC determines that an application meets these standards and appears to represent, in CCC's judgment, the best use of available resources, CCC will respond to the applicant with a letter of preliminary commitment indicating CCC's interest in issuing a facility payment guarantee conditioned on its approval of the exporter's final application.</p>
