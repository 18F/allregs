                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Since the Act does not prescribe particular procedures for the  nomination of candidates, the labor organization is free to employ any  method that will provide a reasonable opportunity for making  nominations. There are various methods which, if properly and fairly  employed, would be considered reasonable under the Act. For example,  nominations may be by petition, or from the floor at a nomination  meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whether a particular procedure is sufficient to satisfy the  requirements of the Act is a question which will depend upon the  particular facts in each case. While a particular procedure may not on  its face violate the requirements of the Act, its application in a given  instance may make nomination so difficult as to deny the members a  reasonable opportunity to nominate.</p>
