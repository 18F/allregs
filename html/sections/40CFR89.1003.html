After the date on which a new standard takes effect, nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers may continue to use nonroad engines built prior to this date that are not certified to the standard until inventories of those engines are depleted; however, stockpiling of such nonroad engines will be considered a violation of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)-(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A new nonroad engine intended solely to replace a nonroad engine in a piece of nonroad equipment, where the engine requiring replacement is not certified or is certified to emission standards that are less stringent than those in effect when the replacement engine is built, shall not be subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or to the requirements of

Sec. 89.105 and paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The engine manufacturer has ascertained that no engine produced by itself or by the manufacturer of the engine that is being replaced, if different, and certified to the requirements of this subpart, is available with the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower the equipment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The engine manufacturer or its agent takes ownership and possession of the engine being replaced or confirms that the engine has been destroyed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the engine being replaced was not subject to any emission standards under this part, the replacement engine must have a permanent label with your corporate name and trademark and the following language, or similar alternate language approved by the Administrator: THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH FEDERAL NONROAD OR ON-HIGHWAY EMISSION REQUIREMENTS. SALE OR INSTALLATION OF THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN AS A REPLACEMENT ENGINE FOR AN ENGINE MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1 [INSERT APPROPRIATE YEAR] IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the engine being replaced was subject to emission standards less stringent than those in effect when you produce the replacement engine, the replacement engine must have a permanent label with your corporate name and trademark and the following language, or similar alternate language approved by the Administrator:</p><p class="depth4">THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA NONROAD EMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR [Identify the appropriate emission standards (by model year, tier, or emission levels) for the replaced engine] ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 89.1003(b)(7).
