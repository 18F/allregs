                                Sec. 1.1014-4  Uniformity of basis; adjustment to basis.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis of property acquired from a decedent,  as determined under section 1014(a), is uniform in the hands of every  person having possession or enjoyment of the property at any time under  the will or other instrument or under the laws of descent and  distribution. The principle of uniform basis means that the basis of the  property (to which proper adjustments must, of course, be made) will be  the same, or uniform, whether the property is possessed or enjoyed by  the executor or administrator, the heir, the legatee or devisee, or the  trustee or beneficiary of a trust created by a will or an inter vivos  trust. In determining the amount allowed or allowable to a taxpayer in  computing taxable income as deductions for depreciation or depletion  under section 1016(a)(2), the uniform basis of the property shall at all  times be used and adjusted. The sale, exchange, or other disposition by  a life tenant or remainderman of his interest in property will, for  purposes of this section, have no effect upon the uniform basis of the  property in the hands of those who acquired it from the decedent. Thus,  gain or loss on sale of trust assets by the trustee will be determined  without regard to the prior sale of any interest in the property.  Moreover, any adjustment for depreciation shall be made to the   uniform basis of the property without regard to such prior sale,  exchange, or other disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under the law governing wills and the distribution of the  property of decedents, all titles to property acquired by bequest,  devise, or inheritance relate back to the death of the decedent, even  though the interest of the person taking the title was, at the date of  death of the decedent, legal, equitable, vested, contingent, general,  specific, residual, conditional, executory, or otherwise. Accordingly,  there is a common acquisition date for all titles to property acquired  from a decedent within the meaning of section 1014, and, for this  reason, a common or uniform basis for all such interests. For example,  if distribution of personal property left by a decedent is not made  until one year after his death, the basis of such property in the hands  of the legatee is its fair market value at the time when the decedent  died, and not when the legatee actually received the property. If the  bequest is of the residue to trustees in trust, and the executors do not  distribute the residue to such trustees until five years after the death  of the decedent, the basis of each piece of property left by the  decedent and thus received, in the hands of the trustees, is its fair  market value at the time when the decedent dies. If the bequest is to  trustees in trust to pay to A during his lifetime the income of the  property bequeathed, and after his death to distribute such property to  the survivors of a class, and upon A's death the property is distributed  to the taxpayer as the sole survivor, the basis of such property, in the  hands of the taxpayer, is its fair market value at the time when the  decedent died. The purpose of the Code in prescribing a general uniform  basis rule for property acquired from a decedent is, on the one hand, to  tax the gain, in respect of such property, to him who realizes it  (without regard to the circumstances that at the death of the decedent  it may have been quite uncertain whether the taxpayer would take or gain  anything); and, on the other hand, not to recognize as gain any element  of value resulting solely from the circumstance that the possession or  enjoyment of the taxpayer was postponed. Such postponement may be, for  example, until the administration of the decedent's estate is completed,  until the period of the possession or enjoyment of another has  terminated, or until an uncertain event has happened. It is the increase  or decrease in the value of property reflected in a sale or other  disposition which is recognized as the measure of gain or loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The principles stated in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this  paragraph do not apply to property transferred by an executor,  administrator or trustee, to an heir, legatee, devisee or beneficiary  under circumstances such that the transfer constitutes a sale or  exchange. In such a case, gain or loss must be recognized by the  transferor to the extent required by the revenue laws, and the  transferee acquires a basis equal to the fair market value of the  property on the date of the transfer. Thus, for example, if the trustee  of a trust created by will transfers to a beneficiary, in satisfaction  of a specific bequest of $10,000, securities which had a fair market  value of $9,000 on the date of the decedent's death (the applicable  valuation date) and $10,000 on the date of the transfer, the trust  realizes a taxable gain of $1,000 and the basis of the securities in the  hands of the beneficiary would be $10,000. As a further example, if the  executor of an estate transfers to a trust property worth $200,000,  which had a fair market value of $175,000 on the date of the decedent's  death (the applicable valuation date), in satisfaction of the decedent's  bequest in trust for the benefit of his wife of cash or securities to be  selected by the executor in an amount sufficient to utilize the marital  deduction to the maximum extent authorized by law (after taking into  consideration any other property qualifying for the marital deduction),  capital gain in the amount of $25,000 would be realized by the estate  and the basis of the property in the hands of the trustees would be  $200,000. If, on the other hand, the decedent bequeathed a fraction of  his residuary estate to a trust for the benefit of his wife, which  fraction will not change regardless of any fluctuations in value of  property in the decedent's estate after his death, no gain or loss would  be realized by the estate upon transfer   of property to the trust, and the basis of the property in the hands of  the trustee would be its fair market value on the date of the decedent's  death or on the alternate valuation date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multiple interests. Where more than one person has an interest  in property acquired from a decedent, the basis of such property shall  be determined and adjusted without regard to the multiple interests. The  basis of computing gain or loss on the sale of any one of such multiple  interests shall be determined under Sec. 1.1014-5. Thus, the deductions  for depreciation and for depletion allowed or allowable, under sections  167 and 611, to a legal life tenant as if the life tenant were the  absolute owner of the property, constitute an adjustment to the basis of  the property not only in the hands of the life tenant, but also in the  hands of the remainderman and every other person to whom the same  uniform basis is applicable. Similarly, the deductions allowed or  allowable under sections 167 and 611, both to the trustee and to the  trust beneficiaries, constitute an adjustment to the basis of the  property not only in the hands of the trustee, but also in the hands of  the trust beneficiaries and every other person to whom the uniform basis  is applicable. See, however, section 262. Similarly, adjustments in  respect of capital expenditures or losses, tax-free distributions, or  other distributions applicable in reduction of basis, or other items for  which the basis is adjustable are made without regard to which one of  the persons to whom the same uniform basis is applicable makes the  capital expenditures or sustains the capital losses, or to whom the tax- free or other distributions are made, or to whom the deductions are  allowed or allowable. See Sec. 1.1014-6 for adjustments in respect of  property acquired from a decedent prior to his death.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Records. The executor or other legal representative of the  decedent, the fiduciary of a trust under a will, the life tenant and  every other person to whom a uniform basis under this section is  applicable, shall maintain records showing in detail all deductions,  distributions, or other items for which adjustment to basis is required  to be made by sections 1016 and 1017, and shall furnish to the district  director such information with respect to those adjustments as he may  require.</p>
