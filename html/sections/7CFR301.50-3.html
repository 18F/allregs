                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section,  the Administrator will list as a quarantined area, in paragraph (c) of  this section, each State, or each portion of a State, in which the pine  shoot beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator  has reason to believe that the pine shoot beetle is present, or that the  Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its  inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in  which the pine shoot beetle has been found. Less than an entire State  will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator  determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine and  regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate movement of the  regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart  on the interstate movement of these articles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated  area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate  spread of the pine shoot beetle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any  nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with  the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The  Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written  notice of this temporary designation to the owner or person in  possession of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate  movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as  a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable,  this area will be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section, or  the designation will be   terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in  possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given  notice of the termination as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The areas described below are designated as quarantined areas:</p><p class="depth2">Connecticut  The entire State.</p><p class="depth2">Illinois  Boone County.
