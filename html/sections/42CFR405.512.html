                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Procedural terminology and coding systems are designed  to provide physicians and third party payers with a common language that  accurately describes the kinds and levels of services provided and that  can serve as a basis for coverage and payment determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Modification of terminology and/or coding systems. A carrier  that wishes to modify its system of procedural terminology and coding  shall submit its request to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  with all pertinent data and information for approval before the revision  is implemented. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will  evaluate the proposal in the light of the guidelines specified in  paragraph (c) of this section and such other considerations as may be  pertinent, and consult with the Assistant Secretary for Health. The  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will approve such a revision if  it determines that the potential advantages of the proposed new system,  outweigh the disadvantages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Guidelines. The following considerations and guidelines are  taken into account in evaluating a carrier's proposal to change its  system of procedural terminology and coding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rationale for converting to the new terminology and coding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated short-run and long-run impact on the cost of the  health insurance program, other medical care costs, administrative  expenses, and the reliability of the estimates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The degree to which the conversion to the proposed new  terminology and coding can be accomplished in a way that permits full  implementation   of the reasonable charge criteria in accordance with the provisions of  this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The degree to which the proposed new terminology and coding are  accepted by physicians in the carrier's area (physician acceptance is  assumed only if a majority of the Medicare and non-Medicare bills and  claims completed by physicians in the area and submitted to the carrier  can reasonably be expected to utilize the proposed new terminology and  coding);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The extent to which the proposed new terminology and coding  system is used by the carrier in its non-Medicare business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The clarity with which the proposed system defines its  terminology and whether the system lends itself to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Accurate determinations of coverage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proper assessment of the appropriate level of payment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Meeting the carrier's or Professional Standards Review  Organizations' review needs and such other review needs as may be  appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Compatibility of the new terminology and coding system with  other systems that the carrier and other carriers may utilize in the  administration of the Medicare program--e.g., its compatibility with  systems and statistical requirements and with the historical data in the  carrier's processing system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Compatibility of the proposed system with the carriers methods  for determining payment under the fee schedule for physicians' services  for services which are identified by a single element of terminology but  which may vary in content.
