                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em> defines  substantial product hazard as either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A failure to comply with an applicable consumer product safety  rule, which failure creates a substantial risk of injury to the public,  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A product defect which (because of the pattern of defect, the  number of defective products distributed in commerce, the severity of  the risk, or otherwise) creates a substantial risk of injury to the  public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the  CPSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and  (d)), empower the Commission to order a manufacturer (including an  importer), distributor, or retailer of a consumer product distributed in  commerce that presents a substantial product hazard to give various  forms of notice to the public of the defect or the failure to comply  and/or to order the subject firm to elect either to repair, to replace,  or to refund the purchase price of such product. However, information  which should be reported under section 15(b) of the CPSA does not  automatically indicate the presence of a substantial product hazard,  because what must be reported under section 15(b) are failures to comply  with consumer product safety rules or voluntary standards upon which the  Commission has relied under section 9, defects that could create a  substantial product hazard, and products which create an unreasonable  risk of serious injury or death. (See Sec. 1115.12.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d))</em>, manufacturers (including  importers), distributors, and retailers of consumer products which are  subject to regulation under provisions of the FFA, FHSA, and PPPA must  comply with the reporting requirements of section 15(b).
