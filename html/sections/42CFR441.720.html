                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. For each individual determined to be eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit, the State must provide for an independent assessment of needs, which may include the results of a standardized functional needs assessment, in order to establish a service plan. In applying the requirements of section 1915(i)(1)(F) of the Act, the State must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform a face-to-face assessment of the individual by an agent who is independent and qualified as defined in Sec.  441.730, and with a person-centered process that meets the requirements of Sec.  441.725(a) and is guided by best practice and research on effective strategies that result in improved health and quality of life outcomes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the purposes of this section, a face-to-face assessment may include

assessments performed by telemedicine, or other information technology medium, if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The agent performing the assessment is independent and qualified as defined in Sec.  441.730 and meets the provider qualifications defined by the State, including any additional qualifications or training requirements for the operation of required information technology.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The individual receives appropriate support during the assessment, including the use of any necessary on-site support-staff.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The individual provides informed consent for this type of assessment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conduct the assessment in consultation with the individual, and if applicable, the individual's authorized representative, and include the opportunity for the individual to identify other persons to be consulted, such as, but not limited to, the individual's spouse, family, guardian, and treating and consulting health and support professionals responsible for the individual's care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examine the individual's relevant history including the findings from the independent evaluation of eligibility, medical records, an objective evaluation of functional ability, and any other records or information needed to develop the person-centered service plan as required in Sec.  441.725.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include in the assessment the individual's physical, cognitive, and behavioral health care and support needs, strengths and preferences, available service and housing options, and if unpaid caregivers will be relied upon to implement any elements of the person-centered service plan, a caregiver assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each service, apply the State's additional needs-based criteria (if any) that the individual may require. Individuals are considered enrolled in the State plan HCBS benefit only if they meet the eligibility and needs-based criteria for the benefit, and are also assessed to require and receive at least one home and community-based service offered under the State plan for medical assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Include in the assessment, if the State offers individuals the option to self-direct a State plan home and community-based service or services, any information needed for the self-directed portion of the service plan, as required in Sec.  441.740(b), including the ability of the individual (with and without supports) to exercise budget or employer authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Include in the assessment, for individuals receiving habilitation services, documentation that no Medicaid services are provided which would otherwise be available to the individual, specifically including but not limited to services available to the individual through a program funded under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Include in the assessment and subsequent service plan, for individuals receiving Secretary approved services under the authority of Sec.  440.182 of this chapter, documentation that no State plan HCBS are provided which would otherwise be available to the individual through other Medicaid services or other Federally funded programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Include in the assessment and subsequent service plan, for individuals receiving HCBS through a waiver approved under Sec.  441.300, documentation that HCBS provided through the State plan and waiver are not duplicative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Coordinate the assessment and subsequent service plan with any other assessment or service plan required for services through a waiver authorized under section 1115 or section 1915 of the Social Security Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reassessments. The independent assessment of need must be conducted at least every 12 months and as needed when the individual's support needs or circumstances change significantly, in order to revise the service plan.</p>
