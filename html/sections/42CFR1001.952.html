Replenished drugs or supplies may only be billed  (including claiming bad debt) to a Federal health care program by either  the ambulance provider (or first responder) or the receiving facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All billing or claims submission by the receiving facility,  ambulance provider or first responder for replenished drugs and medical  supplies used in connection with the transport of a Federal health care  program beneficiary must comply with all applicable Federal health care  program payment and coverage rules and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Compliance with paragraph (v)(2)(i)(B) of this section will be  determined separately for the receiving facility and the ambulance  provider (and first responder, if any), so long as the receiving  facility, ambulance provider (or first responder) refrains from doing  anything that would impede the other party or parties from meeting their  obligations under paragraph (v)(2)(i)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The receiving facility or ambulance provider, or both, must</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintain records of the replenished drugs and medical supplies  and the patient transport to which the replenished drugs and medical  supplies related;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provide a copy of such records to the other party within a  reasonable time (unless the other party is separately maintaining  records of the replenished drugs and medical supplies); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Make those records available to the Secretary promptly upon  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A pre-hospital care report (including, but not limited to, a  trip sheet, patient care report or patient encounter report) prepared by  the ambulance provider and filed with the receiving facility will meet  the requirements of paragraph (v)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, provided  that it documents the specific type and amount of medical supplies and  drugs used on the patient and subsequently replenished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of paragraph (v)(2)(ii) of this section,  documentation may be maintained and, if required, filed with the other  party in hard copy or electronically. If a replenishing arrangement  includes linens, documentation need not be maintained for their  exchange. If documentation is not maintained for the exchange of linens,  the receiving facility will be presumed to have provided an exchange of  comparable clean linens for soiled linens for each ambulance transport  of a patient to the receiving facility. Records required under paragraph  (v)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be maintained for 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The replenishing arrangement must not take into account the  volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between  the parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part under any  Federal health care program (other than the referral of the particular  patient to whom the replenished drugs and medical supplies were  furnished).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The receiving facility and the ambulance provider otherwise  comply with all Federal, State, and local laws regulating ambulance  services, including, but not limited to, emergency services, and the  provision of drugs and medical supplies, including, but not limited to,  laws relating to the handling of controlled substances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To qualify under paragraph (v) of this section, the arrangement  must satisfy all of the standards in one of the following three  categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)(1)</em>, (2), or (3) of this  section. A receiving facility may offer replenishing to one or more of  the categories and may offer different replenishing arrangements to  different categories, so long as the replenishing is   conducted uniformly within each category. For example, a receiving  facility may offer to replenish a broader array of drugs or supplies for  ambulance providers that do no not charge for their services than for  ambulance providers that charge for their services. Within each  category, the receiving facility may limit its replenishing arrangements  to the replenishing of emergency ambulance transports only. A receiving  facility may offer replenishing to one or more of the categories--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All ambulance providers that do not bill any patient or insurer  (including Federal health care programs) for ambulance services,  regardless of the payor or the patient's ability to pay (i.e., ambulance  providers, such as volunteer companies, that provide ambulance services  without charge to any person or entity);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All not-for-profit and State or local government ambulance  service providers (including, but not limited to, municipal and  volunteer ambulance services providers); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All ambulance service providers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> The replenishing arrangement must be conducted in an open and  public manner. A replenishing arrangement will be considered to be  conducted in an open and public manner if one of the following two  conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The replenishment arrangement operates in accordance with a  plan or protocol of general application promulgated by an Emergency  Medical Services (EMS) Council or comparable entity, agency or  organization, provided a copy of the plan or protocol is available upon  request to ambulance providers, Government representatives and members  of the public (subject to reasonable photocopying charges). While  parties are encouraged to participate in collaborative, comprehensive,  community-wide EMS systems to improve the delivery of EMS in their local  communities, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring  the involvement of such organizations or the development or  implementation of ambulance replenishment plans or protocols by such  organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nothing in this paragraph (v)(3)(i) shall be construed as  requiring disclosure of confidential proprietary or financial  information related to the replenishing arrangement (including, but not  limited to, information about cost, pricing or the volume of replenished  drugs or supplies) to ambulance providers or members of the general  public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fair market value replenishing. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (v)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the ambulance  provider must pay the receiving facility fair market value, based on an  arms-length transaction, for replenished medical supplies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If payment is not made at the same time as the replenishing of  the medical supplies, the receiving facility and the ambulance provider  must make commercially reasonable payment arrangements in advance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Government mandated replenishing. The replenishing arrangement  is undertaken in accordance with a State or local statute, ordinance,  regulation or binding protocol that requires hospitals or receiving  facilities in the area subject to such requirement to replenish  ambulances that deliver patients to the hospital with drugs or medical  supplies (including linens) that are used during the transport of that  patient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of paragraph (v) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A receiving facility is a hospital or other facility that  provides emergency medical services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An ambulance provider is a provider or supplier of ambulance  transport services that provides emergency ambulance services. The term  does not include a provider of ambulance transport services that  provides only non-emergency transport services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A first responder includes, but is not limited to, a fire  department, paramedic service or search and rescue squad that responds  to an emergency call (through 9-1-1 or other emergency access number)  and treats the patient, but does not transport the patient to the  hospital or other receiving facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An emergency ambulance service is a transport by ambulance  initiated as a result of a call through 9-1-1 or other emergency access  number or a call from another acute care facility unable to provide the  higher level care required by the patient and available at the receiving  facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Medical supplies includes linens, unless otherwise provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Health centers. As used in section 1128B of the Act,  ``remuneration'' does not include the transfer of any goods, items,  services, donations or loans (whether the donation or loan is in cash or  in-kind), or combination thereof from an individual or entity to a  health center (as defined in this paragraph), as long as the following  nine standards are met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transfer is made pursuant to a contract, lease, grant,  loan, or other agreement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is set out in writing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is signed by the parties; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Covers, and specifies the amount of, all goods, items, services,  donations, or loans to be provided by the individual or entity to the  health center.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of goods, items, services, donations, or loans  specified in the agreement in accordance with paragraph (w)(1)(i)(C) of  this section may be a fixed sum, fixed percentage, or set forth by a  fixed methodology. The amount may not be conditioned on the volume or  value of Federal health care program business generated between the  parties. The written agreement will be deemed to cover all goods, items,  services, donations, or loans provided by the individual or entity to  the health center as required by paragraph (w)(1)(i)(C) of this section  if all separate agreements between the individual or entity and the  health center incorporate each other by reference or if they cross- reference a master list of agreements that is maintained centrally, is  kept up to date, and is available for review by the Secretary upon  request. The master list should be maintained in a manner that preserves  the historical record of arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The goods, items, services, donations, or loans are medical or  clinical in nature or relate directly to services provided by the health  center as part of the scope of the health center's section 330 grant  (including, by way of example, billing services, administrative support  services, technology support, and enabling services, such as case  management, transportation, and translation services, that are within  the scope of the grant).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The health center reasonably expects the arrangement to  contribute meaningfully to the health center's ability to maintain or  increase the availability, or enhance the quality, of services provided  to a medically underserved population served by the health center, and  the health center documents the basis for the reasonable expectation  prior to entering the arrangement. The documentation must be made  available to the Secretary upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the health  center must re-evaluate the arrangement to ensure that the arrangement  is expected to continue to satisfy the standard set forth in paragraph  (w)(3) of this section, and must document the re-evaluation  contemporaneously. The documentation must be made available to the  Secretary upon request. Arrangements must not be renewed or renegotiated  unless the health center reasonably expects the standard set forth in  paragraph (w)(3) of this section to be satisfied in the next agreement  term. Renewed or renegotiated agreements must comply with the  requirements of paragraph (w)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The individual or entity does not (i) Require the health center  (or its affiliated health care professionals) to   refer patients to a particular individual or entity, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> restrict the health center (or its affiliated health care  professionals) from referring patients to any individual or entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Individuals and entities that offer to furnish goods, items, or  services without charge or at a reduced charge to the health center must  furnish such goods, items, or services to all patients from the health  center who clinically qualify for the goods, items, or services,  regardless of the patient's payor status or ability to pay. The  individual or entity may impose reasonable limits on the aggregate  volume or value of the goods, items, or services furnished under the  arrangement with the health center, provided such limits do not take  into account a patient's payor status or ability to pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The agreement must not restrict the health center's ability, if  it chooses, to enter into agreements with other providers or suppliers  of comparable goods, items, or services, or with other lenders or  donors. Where a health center has multiple individuals or entities  willing to offer comparable remuneration, the health center must employ  a reasonable methodology to determine which individuals or entities to  select and must document its determination. In making these  determinations, health centers should look to the procurement standards  for beneficiaries of Federal grants set forth in 45 CFR 74.40 through  74.48.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The health center must provide effective notification to  patients of their freedom to choose any willing provider or supplier.
