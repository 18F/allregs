                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to owners or operators of existing affected sources who seek to comply with Sec. 63.483(b) by using emissions averaging rather than following the provisions of Secs. 63.484, 63.485, 63.486, 63.494, and 63.501.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following emission point limitations apply to the use of these provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All emission points included in an emissions average shall be from the same affected source. There may be an emissions average for each individual affected source located at a plant site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> If a plant site has only one affected source for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed to be included in the emission average is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a plant site has only one affected source for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed to be included in the emission average is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a plant site has two or more affected sources for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed in the emissions average for those affected sources is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions averages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with the provisions of this section may be based on either organic HAP or TOC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of the provisions in this section, whenever Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is specified within the paragraphs of this section or is specified by reference through provisions outside this section, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Emissions Averaging Plan containing all of the information required in Sec. 63.506(e)(4) for all emission

points to be included in an emissions average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section describe the emission points that may be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point. Paragraph (c)(5) of this section discusses the use of pollution prevention in generating emissions averaging credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Storage vessels, batch front-end process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, continuous front-end process vents, and process wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 2 emission points.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Storage vessels, continuous front-end process vents, and process wastewater steams that are determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies shall be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Batch front-end process vents and aggregate batch vent streams that are determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled to a level more stringent than the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Back-end process operations that are controlled such that organic HAP emissions from the back-end process operation are less than would be achieved by meeting the residual organic HAP limits in Sec. 63.494. For the purposes of the emission averaging provisions in this section, all back-end process operations at an affected facility shall be considered a single emission point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The percent reduction for any storage vessel, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous front-end process vent, and process wastewater stream shall be determined using the procedures specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For a Group 1 storage vessel, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous front-end process vent, or process wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure shall reduce emissions more than if the reference control technology or standard had been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 storage vessel, batch front-end process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous front-end process vent, or process wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology or standard, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls shall reduce emissions more than if the applicable reference control technology or standard had been applied instead of the pollution prevention measure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 cannot be used to generate credits unless the level of control was increased after November 15, 1990.

EPPU that are shutdown cannot be used to generate credits or debits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Maintenance wastewater cannot be used to generate credits. Wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units cannot be used to generate credits. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart cannot be used to generate credits, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 to a level above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the emission point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the emission point may continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved emissions average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> For all emission points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform the following tasks:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology or standard for those emission points. The Group 1 emission points are identified in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 and Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator may choose to include more than the required number of credit-generating emission points in an emissions average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The initial demonstration in the Emissions Averaging Plan or operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points shall be made under representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data shall be used for all debit and credit calculations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in Sec. 63.506(e)(6). Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by Sec. 63.506(e)(6)(x)(C)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions during the following periods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Emissions during periods of monitoring excursions, as defined in Sec. 63.505 (g) or (h).
