                            <p class="depth0">A request for amendment of an appellate decision under the Privacy  Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) may be entertained. However, such a request may not  be used in lieu of, or to circumvent, the procedures established under  Rules 1000 through 1003 (Sec. Sec. 20.1000-20.1003 of this part). The  Board will review a request for correction of factual information set  forth in a decision. Where the request to amend under the Privacy Act is  an attempt to alter a judgment made by the Board and thereby replace the  adjudicatory authority and functions of the Board, the request will be  denied on the basis that the Act does not authorize a collateral attack  upon that which has already been the subject of a decision of the Board.  The denial will satisfy the procedural requirements of Sec. 1.579 of  this chapter. If otherwise appropriate, the request will be considered  one for reconsideration under Rules 1000 through 1003 (Sec. Sec.  20.1000-20.1003 of this part).  (Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(d); 38 U.S.C. 7103, 7108)    Sec. Sec. 20.1202-20.1299  [Reserved]</p>
