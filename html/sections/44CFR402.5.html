                            <p class="depth0">Order T-1 applies to transportation on or discharge from ships documented under the laws of the United States and aircraft registered under the laws of the United States. These restrictions apply either in the case of a discharge at one of the restricted ports or to discharge at any other port in transit to a restricted destination. The restrictions of Order T-1 do not apply to transportation by foreign carriers, as long as there is no prohibited transportation or discharge by or from a United States flag ship or aircraft after the issuance of Order T-1. Accordingly, if an American flag ship or aircraft, before the issuance of Order T-1, had transported restricted commodities manifested to restricted destinations, and had completed the transportation to a foreign intermediate point and had completed the discharge from the American flag ship or aircraft before the issuance of Order T-1, no violation of that order would have occurred, but Order T-1 would prohibit further shipment on an American flag ship or aircraft unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.</p>
