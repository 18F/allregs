When the finding is not proved, the  Administrative Law Judge issues an order dismissing the proceeding with  or without prejudice to refile. When the finding is proved, the  Administrative Law Judge may   order an admonition, suspension with or without probation, or  revocation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The order is directed against all credentials or endorsements,  except that in cases of negligence or professional incompetence, the  order is made applicable to specific credentials or endorsements. If the  Administrative Law Judge determines that the respondent is  professionally incompetent in the grade of the license, certificate or  document held, but is considered competent in a lower grade, the  credential or endorsement may be revoked and the issuance of one of a  lower grade ordered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An order must specify whether the credential or endorsement  affected is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Revoked;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Suspended outright for a specified period after surrender;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Suspended for a specified period, but placed on probation for a  specific period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Suspended outright for a specified period, followed by a  specified period of suspension on probation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The order will normally state, that the credential or  endorsement is to be surrendered to the Coast Guard immediately, if the  order is one of revocation or includes a period of outright suspension.  In cases involving special circumstances, the order may provide for  surrender on a certain date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The time of any period of outright suspension ordered does not  commence until the credential or endorsement is surrendered to the Coast  Guard. The time of any period of suspension on probation begins at the  end of any period of outright suspension or the effective date of the  order if there is no outright suspension.
