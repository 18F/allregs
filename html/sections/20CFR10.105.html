                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an employee dies from a work-related traumatic injury or an  occupational disease, any survivor may file a claim for death benefits  using Form CA-5 or CA-5b, which may be obtained from the employer or  from the Internet at www.dol.gov under forms. The survivor must provide  this notice in writing and forward it to the employer. Another person,  including the employer, may do so on the survivor's behalf. The survivor  may also submit the completed Form CA-5 or CA-5b directly to OWCP. The  survivor shall disclose the SSNs of all survivors on whose behalf claim  for benefits is made in addition to the SSN of the deceased employee.  All such notices should be submitted electronically wherever feasible to  facilitate processing of such claims. All employers that currently do  not have such capability should create such a method by December 31,  2012. The survivor may withdraw his or her claim (but not the notice of  death) by so requesting in writing to OWCP at any time before OWCP  determines eligibility for benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> However, in cases of death due to latent disability, the time  for filing the claim does not begin to run until the survivor is aware,  or reasonably should have been aware, of the causal relationship between  the death and the employment (see 5 U.S.C. 8122(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The filing of a notice of injury or occupational disease will  satisfy the time requirements for a death claim based on the same injury  or occupational disease. If an injured employee or someone acting on the  employee's behalf does not file a claim before the employee's death, the  right to claim compensation for disability other than medical expenses  ceases and does not survive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A survivor must be alive to receive any payment; there is no  vested right to such payment. A report as described in Sec. 10.414 of  this part must be filed once each year to support continuing payments of  compensation.</p><p class="depth2">Notices and Claims for Injury, Disease, and Death--Employer's Actions</p>
