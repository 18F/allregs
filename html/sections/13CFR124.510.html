                                Sec. 124.510  What percentage of work must a Participant perform on
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> To assist the business development of Participants in the 8(a) BD program, an 8(a) contractor must perform certain percentages of work with its own employees. These percentages and the requirements relating to them are the same as those established for small business set-aside prime contractors, and are set forth in Sec. 125.6 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A Participant must certify in its offer that it will meet the applicable performance of work requirement. Compliance with the requirement will be determined as of the date of contract award, so that a Participant may revise its initial offer to clarify or otherwise come into compliance with the performance of work requirements. The procuring agency contracting officer must be satisfied that the Participant will meet the applicable performance of work requirement at time of award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity contracts. (1) Total Set-Aside Contracts. The Participant must perform the required percentage of work and comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each performance period of the contract--i.e., during the base term and then during each option period thereafter. However, the contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the Participant to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Partial Set-Aside Contracts. For orders awarded under a partial small business set-aside, the concern must perform the required percentage of work and comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each performance period of the contract--i.e., during the base term and then during each option period thereafter. However, the contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the Participant to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under a partial set aside contract. For orders awarded under the non-set-aside portion, the concern need not comply with any limitations on subcontracting or nonmanufacturer rule requirements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Orders. For orders that are set aside under full and open contracts or reserves, the Participant must perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The applicable SBA District Director may waive the provisions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section requiring a Participant to meet the applicable performance of work requirement for each period of performance or for each order. Instead, the District Director may permit the Participant to subcontract in excess of the limitations on subcontracting where the District Director makes a written determination that larger amounts of subcontracting are essential during certain stages of performance. However, the 8(a) Participant and procuring activity's contracting officer must provide written assurances that the Participant will ultimately comply with the requirements of this section prior to contract completion. The procuring activity's contracting officer does not have the authority to waive the provisions of this section requiring a Participant to meet the applicable performance of work requirements, even if the agency has a Partnership Agreement with SBA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where the Participant does not ultimately comply with the performance of work requirements by the end of the contract, SBA will not grant future waivers for the Participant. Further, the contracting officer must document an 8(a) Participant's performance of work requirements as part of its performance evaluation in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR 42.1502. The contracting officer must also evaluate compliance for future contract awards in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR 9.104-6.
