                            <p class="depth0">Repayments on United States direct loans shall be made to the  authorized collection officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who shall  issue an official receipt for the repayment and deposit the collection  into the revolving loan fund. Collections will first be applied to pay  interest to date of payment and the balance applied on the principal  installment due. Collections on loans made by relending organizations  which have been declared in default in which the Commissioner has taken  control of the assets of the program (including loans made with balances  owing) will be made to an authorized collection officer of the Bureau of  Indian Affairs who shall issue a receipt to the payor and deposit the  collection in the United States revolving loan fund. The relending  organization's loan from the United States will be credited with the  amounts collected from its borrowers,   with the collections applied first on interest accrued and the balance  applied to the principal. Payments on United States direct loans may be  made in advance of due dates without penalty.  [40 FR 3587, Jan. 23, 1975. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982.
