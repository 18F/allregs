If section 1250 property consisting of two or more  elements (described in paragraph (c) of this section) is disposed of  before January 1, 1970, the amount of gain taken into account under  section 1250(a)(2) shall be the sum, determined in three steps under  subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph, of the amounts of  gain for each element.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 1. The first step is to make the following computations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional  depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)), and the gain realized.

The third step is to compute the sum of the amounts of  gain for each element, as determined in step 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Gain of $35,000 is realized upon a sale, before January  1, 1970, of section 1250 property which consists of four elements (W, X,  Y, and Z). Since on the date of the sale the amount of additional  depreciation in respect of the property as a whole ($24,000) is equal to  the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having  additional depreciation and is less than the gain realized, the  additional depreciation for each element is determined under  subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph. The amount of gain taken into  account under section. 1250(a)(2) is $7,500, as determined in the  following table in accordance with the additional facts assumed.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Additional     Applicable     Gain for</p><p class="depth0">Element              depreciationx   percentage=    element ------------------------------------------------------------------------ W............................        $12,000x            0=            0 X............................          6,000x           50=       $3,000 Y............................              0x           63=            0 Z............................          6,000x           75=        4,500</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Totals.....................          24,000  ............        7,500 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that in  respect of the property as a whole the additional depreciation is  $20,000 because with respect to element Y additional depreciation  allowed was $4,000 less than straight line. Accordingly, the sum of the  additional depreciation for each element having additional depreciation  is $24,000, that is, $4,000 greater than the additional depreciation in  respect of the property as a whole. Thus, the additional depreciation  for each element is determined under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this  paragraph. The ratio referred to in subparagraph (3)(ii)(c) of this  paragraph is twenty twenty-fourths, that is, the lower of additional  depreciation in respect of the property as a whole ($20,000) or the gain  realized ($35,000), divided by the sum of the additional depreciation in  respect of each element having additional depreciation ($24,000).

Steps 3 and 4 are used only if the gain  realized exceeds the additional depreciation attributable to periods  after December 31, 1969, in respect of the property as a whole.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Step 1. The first step is to make the following computations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional  depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)) attributable to periods  after December 31, 1969, and the gain realized.

For additional  depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain  transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of  determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element  shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element  as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining  applicable percentage, the holding period for an element shall, except  to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this  section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in Sec.  1.1250-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Step 2.

For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the  holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223,  applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the  purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period of an  element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e),  and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules  prescribed in Sec. 1.1250-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Step (4).

Gain of $60,000 is realized upon a sale, after the  December 31, 1969, of section 1250 property which was constructed by the  taxpayer after such date. The property consists of four elements (W, X,  Y, and Z). Since on the date of sale the amount of additional  depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect  of the property as a whole ($32,000), is equal to the sum of the  additional depreciation in respect of each element having such  additional depreciation and is less than the gain realized, the gain  recognized for each element is determined under subparagraph (3)(i) of  this paragraph.

The sum of the additional  depreciation for each element having additional depreciation is $30,000,  or $6,000 more than the additional depreciation in respect of the  property as a whole. Thus, the gain recognized for each element under  section 1250(a)(1) is determined under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this  paragraph.

For purposes of this  section, with respect to any section 1250 property, the term separate  improvement means an addition to capital account described in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which qualifies as an improvement  under the 1-year test prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph  and which satisfies the 36-month test prescribed in subparagraph (4) of  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Addition to capital account. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of any section 1250  property, an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph  is any addition to capital account in respect of such property after its  initial acquisition or completion by the taxpayer or by any person who  held the property during a period included in the taxpayer's holding  period (see Sec. 1.1250-4) for the property. An addition to the capital  account of section 1250 property may arise, for example, if there is an  expenditure for section 1250 property which is an improvement,  replacement, addition, or alteration to such property (regardless of  whether the cost thereof is capitalized or charged against the  depreciation reserve). In such a case, the addition to capital account  is the gross addition, unreduced by amounts attributable to replaced  property, to the net capital account and not the net addition to such  account. Thus, if a roof has an adjusted basis of $20,000, and is  replaced by constructing a new roof at a cost of $50,000, the gross  addition of $50,000 is an addition to capital account. (The adjusted  basis of the old roof is no longer included in the capital   account for the property.) For purposes of this section, the status of  an addition to capital account is not affected by whether or not it is  treated as a separate property for purposes of determining depreciation  adjustments. In case of an addition to the capital account of property  arising after December 31, 1963, upon a disposition referred to in  section 1250(d)(4) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary  conversions) of a portion of an item of such property, the amount of  such addition (and its basis for all purposes of the Code) shall be the  basis thereof determined under paragraph (d) (2), (3), or (4) (whichever  is applicable) of Sec. 1.1250-3, applied by treating such portion and  such addition as separate properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess  of the adjusted basis of section 1250 property in the hands of a  transferee immediately after a transaction referred to in section  1250(e)(2) (relating to holding period of property with transferred  basis) over its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor  immediately before the transaction. Thus, for example, such excess may  arise from a gift which is in part a sale or exchange (see paragraph  (a)(2) of Sec. 1.1250-3), from an increase in basis due to gift tax  paid (see section 1015(d)), from a transfer referred to in paragraph  (c)(2) of Sec. 1.1250-3 (relating to certain tax-free transactions) in  which gain is partially recognized, or from a distribution by a  partnership to a partner in which no gain is recognized by reason of the  application of section 731. Similarly, an addition to capital account  may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of a principal  residence acquired in a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(3)  over the adjusted basis of the principal residence disposed of, as well  as to any increase in the adjusted basis of section 1250 property of a  partnership by reason of an optional basis adjustment under section  734(b) or 743(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether or not an expenditure shall be treated as an addition  to capital account described in this subparagraph, as distinguished from  a separate item of property, may depend on how the property or  properties are disposed of. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer, who owns a  motel consisting of 10 buildings with common heating and plumbing  systems, adds to the motel three new buildings which are connected to  the common systems, and if the taxpayer sells the motel to one person in  one transaction, then for purposes of this subparagraph the cost of the  three new buildings shall be treated as an addition to the capital  account of the motel and, if the 1-year and 36-month tests of  subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph are satisfied, the motel  consists of at least two elements. If, however, the 10-building group  and the three-building group were individually sold in separate  transactions to two different people each of whom would operate his  group as a separate business, the motel would consist of two items of  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> One-year test for improvement. (i) An addition to capital  account of section 1250 property for any taxable year (including a short  taxable year and the entire taxable year in which the disposition  occurs) shall be treated as an improvement only if the sum of all  additions to the capital account of such property for such taxable year  exceeds the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> $2,000, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> One percent of the unadjusted basis of the property, determined  as of the beginning (1) of such taxable year, or (2) of the holding  period (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1250-4) of the property, whichever  is the later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, the term unadjusted basis means  the adjusted basis of the property, determined without regard to the  adjustments provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3) (relating to  adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and depletion). For purposes  of this paragraph, as of any particular date the unadjusted basis of  section 1250 property (a) includes the cost of any addition to capital  account for the property which arises prior to such date (regardless of  whether such addition qualified under this subparagraph as an  improvement), and (b) does not include the cost of a component retired  before such date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In respect of a particular disposition of section 1250  property by a person:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> There shall not be taken into account under the 1-year test for  improvements in this subparagraph any addition to capital account which  arises by reason of (or after) such disposition or which arises before  the beginning of the holding period under Sec. 1.1250-4 of such person  for the property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such test shall be made in respect of each taxable year of such  person (and of any prior transferor) any day of which is included under  Sec. 1.1250-4 in such person's holding period for the property, except  that (1) such test shall be made for a taxable year of such person only  if such person actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such  taxable year, and (2) such test shall be made for a taxable year of such  prior transferor only if such prior transferor actually owned the  property on at least 1 day of such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The unadjusted basis of section 1250 property as of the  beginning of January 1, 1960, is $300,000. During the taxable year  ending on December 31, 1960, the only additions to the capital account  for the property are addition A on January 1, 1960, costing $1,000, and  addition B on July 1, 1960, costing $600. Since the sum of the amounts  added to capital account for such taxable year is less than $2,000, A  and B are not treated as improvements. This result would not be changed  if addition C, costing $600, were added on December 15, 1960, since  although the sum of the additions ($1,000 plus $600 plus $600, or  $2,200) exceeds $2,000, such sum is less than 1 percent of the  unadjusted basis of the property as of the beginning of 1960 ($3,000,  that is, 1 percent of $300,000). If however, C cost $1,500, then A, B,  and C would each be considered an improvement since the sum of the  amounts added to capital account $3,100) would exceed $3,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Green and his son both use the calendar year as the  taxable year. On February 1, 1965, Green makes addition A to a piece of  section 1250 property. On June 15, 1965, Green transfers such property  to his son as a gift which is in part a sale (see paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.1250-3). Addition B arises by reason of the transfer. On August 1,  1965, the son makes addition C to the property. For purposes of  determining the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a) to Green  upon the transfer, the determination of whether addition A is an  improvement is made without taking into account additions B and C. For  purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized under section  1250(a) upon a subsequent disposition of the property by the son,  additions B and C would be taken into account in the determination of  whether A is an improvement, and A would be taken into account in the  determination of whether B and C are improvements.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in example (2). Assume further  that on September 15, 1965, the son transfers the property to a  corporation in exchange for cash and stock in the corporation in a  transaction qualifying under section 351 (see paragraph (c) of Sec.  1.1250-3), and that the corporation uses a fiscal year ending November  30. For purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized under  section 1250(a) upon a subsequent disposition by the corporation, the  one-year test under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is made for the  entire taxable year of Green and of the son ending on December 31, 1965,  and in respect of the corporation's taxable year ending November 30,  1965. Accordingly, if on December 7, 1965, addition D is made by the  corporation, then, upon a subsequent disposition by the corporation, D  is taken into account for purposes of the determination in respect of  the entire taxable year of Green and of the son ending on December 31,  1965, and for the corporation's taxable year ending November 30, 1966,  but not for purposes of the corporation's taxable year ending November  30, 1965. If D were made on January 3, 1966, D would still be taken into  account for purposes of the determination in respect of the  corporation's taxable year ending November 30, 1966. However, since  neither Green nor his son actually owned the property on any day of the  taxable year ending December 31, 1966, no determination is made in  respect of such taxable year of Green or of the son.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> 36-month test for separate improvement. (i) If, during the 36- month period ending on the last day of any taxable year (including a  short taxable year and the entire taxable year in which the disposition  occurs), the sum of the amounts treated under subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph as improvements for such period exceeds the greatest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 25 percent of the adjusted basis of the property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> 10 percent of the unadjusted basis (determined under  subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph) of the property, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> $5,000,  Then each such improvement during such period shall be treated as a  separate improvement, and thus as an element. For purposes of (a) and  (b) of this subdivision, the adjusted basis (or   unadjusted basis) of section 1250 property shall be determined as of the  beginning of the 36-month period, or as of the beginning of the holding  period of the property (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1250-4), whichever  is the later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In respect of a particular disposition of section 1250 property  by a person:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> There shall not be taken into account under the 36-month test  for separate improvements in this subparagraph any amount treated under  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as an improvement which arises by  reason of (or after) the disposition or which arises before the  beginning of the holding period under Sec. 1.1250-4 of such person for  the property, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Such test shall be made in respect of each 36-month period  ending on the last day of each taxable year of such person (and of any  prior transferor) if at least 1 day of such period is included under  Sec. 1.1250-4 in such person's holding period for the property, except  that (1) such test shall be made for a 36-month period ending on the  last day of a taxable year of such person only if such person actually  owned the property on at least 1 day of such period, and (2) such test  shall be made for a 36-month period ending on the last day of a taxable  year of such prior transferor only if such prior transferor actually  owned the property on at least 1 day of such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For illustration of the principles of subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph, see examples (2) and (3) in subparagraph (3)(iv) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example.

First, any element having a deficit in additional  depreciation in the hands of the transferor immediately before such  transfer shall be considered to have the same deficit in the hands of  the transferee. Second, elements having additional depreciation in the  hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer shall be  considered to have additional depreciation in the hands of the  transferee.

The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: Section 1250 property has additional depreciation of  $16,000 of which $12,000 is additional depreciation for element X and  $4,000 for element Y. The property is transferred to a corporation in  exchange for cash of $6,000 and for stock in the corporation. Assume  that recognition of gain under section 1250(a) is limited to $6,000 (the  amount of cash received) by reason of the application of section 351(b)  (relating to transfer to corporation controlled by transferor) and  section 1250(d)(3) (relating to limitation on application of section  1250 in certain tax-free transactions). Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of  Sec. 1.1250-3, the additional depreciation for the property in the  hands of the corporation immediately after the transfer is $10,000, that  is, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the  transferor immediately before the transfer ($16,000) minus the gain  under section 1250(a) recognized upon the transfer ($6,000). Under  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, in the hands of the corporation  immediately after the transfer element X has additional depreciation of  $7,500 (\12/16\ of $10,000) and element Y as additional depreciation of  $2,500 (\4/16\ of $10,000). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section  there is an addition of $6,000 to the capital account for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principal residence.

For purposes of  computing applicable percentage, the holding period for an element of  the principal residence acquired includes the holding period of such  element of the principal residence disposed of, but not the period  beginning on the day after the date of the disposition and ending on the  date of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Holding period for small separate improvements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General.  This paragraph   prescribes a special holding period solely for the purpose of computing  the applicable percentage of a separate improvement (as defined in  paragraph (d) of this section) which is treated as an element. See  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for determination of holding period  under section 1223 for purposes of computing additional depreciation. In  respect of section 1250 property, if the amount of a separate  improvement does not exceed the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $2,000, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section) of such property, determined as of  the beginning of the taxable year in which such separate improvement was  made,  Then such separate improvement shall be treated for purposes of  computing applicable percentage as placed in service on the first day,  of a calendar month, which is the closest such first day to the middle  of the taxable year. See the last sentence of section 1250(f)(4)(B). If  two such first days are equally close to the middle of the taxable year,  the earliest of such days is the applicable day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: (i) The unadjusted basis of section 1250 property as of the  beginning of January 1, 1960, is $100,000. During the taxable year  ending on December 31, 1960, the only additions to the capital account  for the property are addition A on March 10, 1960, costing $1,200 and  addition B on September 16, 1960, costing $1,400. Since the sum of the  additions ($2,600) exceeds the greater of $2,000 and 1 percent of  unadjusted basis ($1,000, that is, 1 percent of $100,000), each addition  is an improvement under the 1-year test of paragraph (d)(3) of this  section. Assume that the 36-month test of paragraph (d)(4) of this  section is satisfied and, therefore, each addition is a separate  improvement treated as an element.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Since each element is less than $2,000, the provisions of this  paragraph apply. Since there are 366 days in 1960, the middle of the  year is at the end of 183 days, or July 1. Thus, that first day of a  calendar month in 1960, which is the closest first day (of a calendar  month) to the middle of the taxable year, is July 1, 1960. Accordingly,  for purposes of computing applicable percentage, elements A and B are  each treated as placed in service on July 1, 1960.
