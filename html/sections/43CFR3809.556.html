                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you choose to use the instruments permitted under Sec.  3809.555(e) in satisfaction of financial guarantee requirements, you  must provide BLM, before you begin operations and by the end of each  calendar year thereafter, a certified statement describing the nature  and market value of the instruments maintained in that account, and  including any current statements or reports furnished by the brokerage  firm to the operator or mining claimant concerning the asset value of  the account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must review the market value of the account instruments by  December 31 of each year to ensure that their market value continues to  be not less than the required dollar amount of the financial guarantee.  When the market value of the account instruments has declined by more  than 10 percent of the required dollar amount of the financial  guarantee, you must, within 10 calendar days after its annual review or  at any time upon the written request of BLM, provide additional  instruments, as defined in Sec. 3809.555(e), to the trust account so  that the total market value of all account instruments is not less than  the required dollar amount of the financial guarantee. You must send a  certified statement to BLM within 45 calendar days thereafter describing  your actions to raise the market value of its account instruments to the  required dollar amount of the financial guarantee. You must include  copies of any statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to  you documenting such an increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If your review under paragraph (b) of this section demonstrates  that the total market value of trust account instruments exceeds 110  percent of the required dollar amount of the financial guarantee, you  may ask BLM to authorize a written release of that portion of the  account that exceeds 110 percent of the required financial guarantee.  BLM will approve your request only if you are in compliance with the  terms and conditions of your notice or approved plan of operations.</p><p class="depth2">Blanket Financial Guarantee</p>
