                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following are modified accredited States: None.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following are modified accredited zones:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A zone in Michigan that comprises Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency,  and Oscoda Counties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any livestock other than cattle or bison are included in a  newly assembled herd on a premises where a tuberculous herd has been  depopulated, the State or zone must apply the herd test requirements  contained in the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis  Eradication'' (January 22, 1999, edition), which is incorporated by  reference at Sec. 77.1, for such newly assembled herds to those other  livestock in the same manner as to cattle and bison. Failure to do so  will result in the removal of the State or zone from the list of  modified accredited States or zones and its being reclassified as  accreditation preparatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If tuberculosis is diagnosed within a modified accredited State  or zone in an animal not specifically regulated by this part and a risk  assessment conducted by APHIS determines that the outbreak poses a  tuberculosis risk to livestock within the State or zone, the State or  zone must implement a tuberculosis management plan, approved jointly by  the State animal health official and the Administrator, within 6 months  of the diagnosis. The management plan must include provisions for  immediate investigation of tuberculosis in animals held for exhibition  and in livestock and wildlife; the prevention of the spread of the  disease to other animals held for exhibition and to livestock and  wildlife; increased surveillance for tuberculosis in animals held for  exhibition and wildlife; eradication of tuberculosis from individual  herds; a timeline for tuberculosis eradication; and performance  standards by which to measure yearly progress toward eradication. If a  State or zone does not implement such a plan within the required 6  months, the State or zone will be reclassified as accreditation  preparatory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Modified accredited State or zone status must be renewed  annually. To qualify for renewal of a modified accredited State or zone  status, a State must submit an annual report to APHIS certifying that  the State or zone complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods  and Rules--Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication.'' The report must be  submitted to APHIS each year between October 1 and November 30.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To qualify for modified accredited advanced status, a modified  accredited State or zone must demonstrate to the Administrator that it  complies with the provisions of the ``Uniform Methods and Rules--Bovine  Tuberculosis Eradication'' and that tuberculosis has been prevalent in  less than 0.01 percent of the total number of herds of cattle and bison  in the State or zone for the most recent 2 years. Except that: The  Administrator, upon his or her review, may allow a State or zone with  fewer than 30,000 herds to have up to 3 affected herds for each of the  most recent 2 years, depending on the veterinary infrastructure,  livestock demographics, and tuberculosis control and eradication  measures in the State or zone.
