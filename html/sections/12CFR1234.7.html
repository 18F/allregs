For purposes of this section, the following definition shall apply:</p><p class="depth0">Special servicer means, with respect to any securitization of commercial real estate loans, any servicer that, upon the occurrence of one or more specified conditions in the servicing agreement, has the right to service one or more assets in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Third-party purchaser. A sponsor may satisfy some or all of its risk retention requirements under Sec. 1234.3 with respect to a securitization transaction if a third party (or any majority-owned affiliate thereof) purchases and holds for its own account an eligible horizontal residual interest in the issuing entity in the same form, amount, and manner as would be held by the sponsor under Sec. 1234.4 and all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Number of third-party purchasers. At any time, there are no more than two third-party purchasers of an eligible horizontal residual interest. If there are two third-party purchasers, each third-party purchaser's interest must be pari passu with the other third-party purchaser's interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Composition of collateral. The securitization transaction is collateralized solely by commercial real estate loans and servicing assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Source of funds. (i) Each third-party purchaser pays for the eligible horizontal residual interest in cash at the closing of the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each third-party purchaser pays for the eligible horizontal residual interest in cash at the closing of the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No third-party purchaser obtains financing, directly or indirectly, for the purchase of such interest from any other person that is a party to, or an affiliate of a party to, the securitization transaction (including, but not limited to, the sponsor, depositor, or servicer other than a special servicer affiliated with the third-party purchaser), other than a person that is a party to the transaction solely by reason of being an investor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Third-party review. Each third-party purchaser conducts an independent review of the credit risk of each securitized asset prior to the sale of the asset-backed securities in the securitization transaction that includes, at a minimum, a review of the underwriting standards, collateral, and expected cash flows of each commercial real estate loan that is collateral for the asset-backed securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Affiliation and control rights. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no third-party purchaser is affiliated with any party to the securitization transaction (including, but not limited to, the sponsor, depositor, or servicer) other than investors in the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no third-party purchaser is affiliated with any party to the securitization transaction (including, but not limited to, the sponsor, depositor, or servicer) other than investors in the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, a third-party purchaser may be affiliated with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The special servicer for the securitization transaction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> One or more originators of the securitized assets, as long as the assets originated by the affiliated originator or originators collectively comprise less than 10 percent of the unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets included in the securitization transaction at the cut-off date or similar date for establishing the composition of the securitized assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities issued pursuant to the securitization transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Operating Advisor. The underlying securitization transaction documents shall provide for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The appointment of an operating advisor (the Operating Advisor) that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is not affiliated with other parties to the securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Does not directly or indirectly have any financial interest in the securitization transaction other than in fees from its role as Operating Advisor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Is required to act in the best interest of, and for the benefit of, investors as a collective whole;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Standards with respect to the Operating Advisor's experience, expertise and financial strength to fulfill its duties and responsibilities under the applicable transaction documents over the life of the securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The terms of the Operating Advisor's compensation with respect to the securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When the eligible horizontal residual interest has been reduced by principal payments, realized losses, and appraisal reduction amounts (which reduction amounts are determined in accordance with the applicable transaction documents) to a principal balance of 25 percent or less of its initial principal balance, the special servicer for the securitized assets must consult with the Operating Advisor in connection with, and prior to, any material decision in connection with its servicing of the securitized assets, including, without limitation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any material modification of, or waiver with respect to, any provision of a loan agreement (including a mortgage, deed of trust, or other security agreement);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Foreclosure upon or comparable conversion of the ownership of a property; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any acquisition of a property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Operating Advisor shall have adequate and timely access to information and reports necessary to fulfill its duties under the transaction documents, including all reports made available to holders of ABS interests and third-party purchasers, and shall be responsible for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reviewing the actions of the special servicer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reviewing all reports provided by the special servicer to the issuing entity or any holder of ABS interests;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Reviewing for accuracy and consistency with the transaction documents calculations made by the special servicer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Issuing a report to investors (including any third-party purchasers) and the issuing entity on a periodic basis concerning:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the Operating Advisor believes, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that the special servicer is operating in compliance with any standard required of the special servicer in the applicable transaction documents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Which, if any, standards the Operating Advisor believes, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, the special servicer has failed to comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)(A)</em> The Operating Advisor shall have the authority to recommend that the special servicer be replaced by a successor special servicer if the Operating Advisor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Operating Advisor shall have the authority to recommend that the special servicer be replaced by a successor special servicer if the Operating Advisor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The special servicer has failed to comply with a standard required of the special servicer in the applicable transaction documents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such replacement would be in the best interest of the investors as a collective whole; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a recommendation described in paragraph (b)(6)(vi)(A) of this section is made, the special servicer shall be replaced upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding principal balance of all ABS interests voting on the matter, with a minimum of a quorum of ABS interests voting on the matter. For purposes of such vote, the applicable transaction documents shall

specify the quorum and may not specify a quorum of more than the holders of 20 percent of the outstanding principal balance of all ABS interests in the issuing entity, with such quorum including at least three ABS interest holders that are not affiliated with each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Disclosures.
