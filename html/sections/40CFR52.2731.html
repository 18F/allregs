                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since the Puerto Rico plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the national standards for sulfur oxides in the areas of Aguirre, Barceloneta, Trujillo Alto-Dorado and Ensenada.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Article 6, as submitted to EPA on January 3, 1975, of the Puerto Rico Regulations for Control of Atmospheric Pollution, as it applies to those areas listed in paragraph (a) of this section is disapproved for the following facilities: Puerto RicoWater Resources Authority--Aguirre Complex, Abbott, Merck and Company, Bristol Meyers, Pfizer, Union Carbide, Upjohn, located in the Barceloneta air basin, and Central Guanica, located in the Aquada air basin. Accordingly, these sources, with the exception of the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority--Aguirre Complex, are required to conform to the sulfur in fuel limitations contained in Article 6 of the Puerto Rico implementation plan as submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On and after the effective date of this paragraph, the maximum allowable sulfur in fuel limitation, by weight, for the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority Aguirre complex shall be 2.5 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act are not met since Article 6 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of Atmospheric Pollution would permit the use of stack height increases in lieu of available methods for emission reduction. Therefore, Section H of Appendix A of Article 6 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of Atmospheric Pollution is disapproved to the extent that it would permit increases in stack height in lieu of available methods of emission reduction.
