                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Who must submit patent information. This section applies to any  applicant who submits to FDA a new drug application or an amendment to  it under section 505(b) of the act and Sec. 314.50 or a supplement to  an approved application under Sec. 314.70, except as provided in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Patents for which information must be submitted and patents for  which information must not be submitted--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. An  applicant described in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit the  required information on the declaration form set forth in paragraph (c)  of this section for each patent that claims the drug or a method of  using the drug that is the subject of the new drug application or  amendment or supplement to it and with respect to which a claim of  patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not  licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or  sale of the drug product. For purposes of this part, such patents  consist of drug substance (active ingredient) patents, drug product  (formulation and composition) patents, and method-of-use patents. For  patents that claim the drug substance, the applicant shall submit  information only on those patents that claim the drug substance that is  the subject of the pending or approved application or that claim a drug  substance that is the same as the active ingredient that is the subject  of the approved or pending application. For patents that claim a  polymorph that is the same as the active ingredient described in the  approved or pending application, the applicant shall certify in the  declaration forms that the applicant has test data, as set forth in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, demonstrating that a drug product  containing the polymorph will perform the same as the drug product  described in the new drug application. For patents that claim a drug  product, the applicant shall submit information only on those patents  that claim a drug product, as is defined in Sec. 314.3, that is  described in the pending or approved application. For patents that claim  a method of use, the applicant shall submit information only on those  patents that claim indications or other conditions of use that are  described in the pending or approved application. The applicant shall  separately identify each pending or approved method of use and related  patent claim. For approved applications, the applicant submitting the  method-of-use patent shall identify with specificity the section of the  approved labeling that corresponds to the method of use claimed by the  patent submitted. Process patents, patents claiming packaging, patents  claiming metabolites, and patents claiming intermediates are not covered  by this section, and information on these patents must not be submitted  to FDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test Data for Submission of Patent Information for Patents That  Claim a Polymorph. The test data, referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A full description of the polymorphic form of the drug  substance, including its physical and chemical characteristics and  stability; the method of synthesis (or isolation) and purification of  the drug substance; the process controls used during manufacture and  packaging; and such specifications and analytical methods as are  necessary to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the  polymorphic form of the drug substance;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The executed batch record for a drug product containing the  polymorphic form of the drug substance and documentation that the batch  was manufactured under current good manufacturing practice requirements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Demonstration of bioequivalence between the executed batch of  the drug product that contains the polymorphic form of the drug  substance and the drug product as described in the NDA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A list of all components used in the manufacture of the drug  product containing the polymorphic form and a statement of the  composition of the drug product; a statement of the specifications and  analytical methods for each component; a description of the  manufacturing and packaging procedures and in-process controls for the  drug product; such specifications and analytical methods as are  necessary to assure the identity, strength, quality, purity, and  bioavailability of the drug product, including release and stability  data complying with the approved product specifications to demonstrate  pharmaceutical equivalence and comparable product stability; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Comparative in vitro dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each  of the executed test batch and the new drug application product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. An applicant  described in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit the required  patent information described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for  each patent that meets the requirements described in paragraph (b) of  this section. We will not accept the patent information unless it is  complete and submitted on the appropriate forms, FDA Forms 3542 or  3542a. These forms may be obtained on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov  by searching for ``forms''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Drug substance (active ingredient), drug product (formulation or  composition), and method-of-use patents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Original Declaration.

FDA will publish in the  list the patent number and expiration date of each patent that is  required to be, and is, submitted to FDA by an applicant, and for each  use patent, the approved indications or other conditions of use covered  by a patent. FDA will publish such patent information upon approval of  the application, or, if the patent information is submitted by the  applicant after approval of an application as provided under paragraph  (d)(2) of this section, as soon as possible after the submission to the  agency of the patent information. Patent information submitted by the  last working day of a month will be published in that month's supplement  to the list. Patent   information received by the Agency between monthly publication of  supplements to the list will be placed on public display in FDA's  Division of Freedom of Information. A request for copies of the file  shall be sent in writing to the Freedom of Information Staff at the  address listed on the Agency's Web site at http://www.fda.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Correction of patent information errors. If any person disputes  the accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted to the agency  under this section and published by FDA in the list, or believes that an  applicant has failed to submit required patent information, that person  must first notify the agency in writing stating the grounds for  disagreement. Such notification should be directed to the Office of  Generic Drugs, OGD Document Room, Attention: Orange Book Staff, 7500  Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. The agency will then request of the  applicable new drug application holder that the correctness of the  patent information or omission of patent information be confirmed.  Unless the application holder withdraws or amends its patent information  in response to FDA's request, the agency will not change the patent  information in the list. If the new drug application holder does not  change the patent information submitted to FDA, a 505(b)(2) application  or an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the act  submitted for a drug that is claimed by a patent for which information  has been submitted must, despite any disagreement as to the correctness  of the patent information, contain an appropriate certification for each  listed patent.
