The Federal Power Act provides that any license which  shall be issued to use tribal lands within a reservation shall be  subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary of the Interior  shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such  lands. (16 U.S.C. 797(e)). In the case of tribal lands belonging to a  tribe organized under the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984), the  Federal Power Act requires that annual charges for the use of such  tribal lands under any license issued by the Federal Power Commission  shall be subject to the approval of the tribe (16 U.S.C. 803(e)).</p>
