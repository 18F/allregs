The  presence on board of a pilot shall not relieve the commanding officer or  any subordinate from his or her responsibility for the proper  performance of the duties with which he or she may be charged concerning  the navigation and handling of the ship. For an exception to the  provisions of this paragraph, see ``Rules and Regulations Covering  Navigation of the Panama Canal and Adjacent Waters,'' (35 CFR Chapter I,  subchapter C) which directs that the pilot assigned to a vessel in those  waters shall have control of the navigation and movement of the vessel.  Also see the provisions of these regulations concerning the navigation  of ships at a naval shipyard or station, or in entering or leaving  drydock.</p>
