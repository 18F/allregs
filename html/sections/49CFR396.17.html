                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Every commercial motor vehicle must be inspected as required by  this section. The inspection must include, at a minimum, the parts and  accessories set forth in appendix G of this   subchapter. The term commercial motor vehicle includes each vehicle in a  combination vehicle. For example, for a tractor semitrailer, full  trailer combination, the tractor, semitrailer, and the full trailer  (including the converter dolly if so equipped) must each be inspected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 396.23 and this paragraph, motor  carriers must inspect or cause to be inspected all motor vehicles  subject to their control. Intermodal equipment providers must inspect or  cause to be inspected intermodal equipment that is interchanged or  intended for interchange to motor carriers in intermodal transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A motor carrier must not use a commercial motor vehicle, and an  intermodal equipment provider must not tender equipment to a motor  carrier for interchange, unless each component identified in appendix G  of this subchapter has passed an inspection in accordance with the terms  of this section at least once during the preceding 12 months and  documentation of such inspection is on the vehicle. The documentation  may be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The inspection report prepared in accordance with Sec.  396.21(a), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other forms of documentation, based on the inspection report  (e.g., sticker or decal), which contains the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date of inspection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name and address of the motor carrier, intermodal equipment  provider, or other entity where the inspection report is maintained;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information uniquely identifying the vehicle inspected if not  clearly marked on the motor vehicle; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A certification that the vehicle has passed an inspection in  accordance with Sec. 396.17.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A motor carrier may perform the required annual inspection for  vehicles under the carrier's control which are not subject to an  inspection under Sec. 396.23(b)(1). An intermodal equipment provider  may perform the required annual inspection for intermodal equipment  interchanged or intended for interchange to motor carriers that are not  subject to an inspection under Sec. 396.23(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In lieu of the self-inspection provided for in paragraph (d) of  this section, a motor carrier or intermodal equipment provider  responsible for the inspection may choose to have a commercial garage,  fleet leasing company, truck stop, or other similar commercial business  perform the inspection as its agent, provided that business operates and  maintains facilities appropriate for commercial vehicle inspections and  it employs qualified inspectors, as required by Sec. 396.19.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Vehicles passing roadside or periodic inspections performed  under the auspices of any State government or equivalent jurisdiction or  the FMCSA, meeting the minimum standards contained in appendix G of this  subchapter, will be considered to have met the requirements of an annual  inspection for a period of 12 months commencing from the last day of the  month in which the inspection was performed. If a vehicle is subject to  a mandatory State inspection program, as provided in Sec. 396.23(b)(1),  a roadside inspection may only be considered equivalent if it complies  with the requirements of that program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> It is the responsibility of the motor carrier or intermodal  equipment provider to ensure that all parts and accessories on  commercial motor vehicles intended for use in interstate commerce for  which they are responsible are maintained at, or promptly repaired to,  the minimum standards set forth in appendix G to this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Failure to perform properly the annual inspection required by  this section shall cause the motor carrier or intermodal equipment  provider to be subject to the penalty provisions of 49 U.S.C. 521(b).
