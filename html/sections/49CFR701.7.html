                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The time limits of the FOIA will begin only after  the requirements for submitting a request as established in Sec. 701.5  have been met, and the request is deemed received by the Freedom of  Information Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for records shall be considered to have been received  on the later of the following dates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requester has agreed in writing to pay applicable fees in  accordance with Sec. 701.5(d), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fees have been waived in accordance with Sec. 701.11(k),  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Payment in advance has been received from the requester when  required in accordance with Sec. 701.11(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time for responding to requests set forth in paragraph (b)  of this section may be delayed if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The request does not sufficiently identify the fee category  applicable to the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The request does not state a willingness to pay all fees;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A request seeking a fee waiver does not address the criteria  for fee waivers set forth in Sec. 701.11(k);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A fee waiver request is denied, and the request does not  include an alternative statement indicating that the requesting party is  willing to pay all fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial determination. Whenever possible, an initial  determination to release or deny a record shall be made within twenty  business days after receipt of the request. In ``unusual circumstances''  as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the time for an initial  determination may be extended for ten business days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multitrack processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amtrak may use two or more processing  tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based  on the amount of work and/or time needed to process a request or the  number of pages involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In general, when requests are received, Amtrak's FOIA Office  will review and categorize them for tracking purposes. Requests within  each track will be processed according to date of receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FOIA Office may contact a requester when a request does not  appear to qualify for fast track processing to provide an opportunity to  limit the scope of the request and qualify for a faster track. Such  notification shall be at the discretion of the FOIA Office and will  depend largely on whether it is believed that a narrowing of the request  could place the request on a faster track.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unusual circumstances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requesting party shall be  notified in writing if the time limits for processing a request cannot  be met because of unusual circumstances, and it will be necessary to  extend the time limits for processing the request. The notification  shall include the date by which the request can be expected to be  completed. Where the extension is for more than ten business days, the  requesting party will be afforded an opportunity to either modify the  request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange  an alternative time   period for processing the initial request or modified request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If Amtrak believes that multiple requests submitted by a  requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert constitute a  single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances and  the requests involve clearly related matters, the requests may be  aggregated. Multiple requests concerning unrelated matters may not be  aggregated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unusual circumstances that may justify delay include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  other facilities that are separate from Amtrak's headquarters offices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous  amount of separate and distinct records sought in a single request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practicable speed, with agencies having a substantial interest in the  determination of the request, or among two or more Amtrak components  having a substantial subject-matter interest in the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals may be taken out  of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that  they involve a compelling need, which means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  Amtrak activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at a later date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester seeking expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's  knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting  expedited processing. This statement must accompany the request in order  to be considered and responded to within the ten calendar days required  for decisions on expedited access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must  establish that he is a person whose main professional activity or  occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his sole  occupation. A requester must establish a particular urgency to inform  the public about the Amtrak activity involved in the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Within ten business days of receipt of a request for expedited  processing, Amtrak shall determine whether to grant such a request and  notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited  treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and shall be  processed as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Amtrak shall provide prompt consideration of appeals of  decisions denying expedited processing.</p>
