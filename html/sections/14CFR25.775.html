                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Internal panes must be made of nonsplintering material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Windshield panes directly in front of the pilots in the normal conduct of their duties, and the supporting structures for these panes, must withstand, without penetration, the impact of a four-pound bird when the velocity of the airplane (relative to the bird along the airplane's flight path) is equal to the value of VC, at sea level, selected under Sec. 25.335(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless it can be shown by analysis or tests that the probability of occurrence of a critical windshield fragmentation condition is of a low order, the airplane must have a means to minimize the danger to the pilots from flying windshield fragments due to bird impact. This must be shown for each transparent pane in the cockpit that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Appears in the front view of the airplane;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is inclined 15 degrees or more to the longitudinal axis of the airplane; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has any part of the pane located where its fragmentation will constitute a hazard to the pilots.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The design of windshields and windows in pressurized airplanes must be based on factors peculiar to high altitude operation, including the effects of continuous and cyclic pressurization loadings, the inherent characteristics of the material used, and the effects of temperatures and temperature differentials. The windshield and window panels must be capable of withstanding the maximum cabin pressure differential loads combined with critical aerodynamic pressure and temperature effects after any single failure in the installation or associated systems. It may be assumed that, after a single failure that is obvious to the flight crew (established under Sec. 25.1523), the cabin pressure differential is reduced from the maximum, in accordance with appropriate operating limitations, to allow continued safe flight of the airplane with a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 15,000 feet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The windshield panels in front of the pilots must be arranged so that, assuming the loss of vision through any one panel, one or more panels remain available for use by a pilot seated at a pilot station to permit continued safe flight and landing.
