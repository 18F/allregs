                            <p class="depth0">Regulations have been issued in accordance with the authority in  section 14 of the Act to provide for employment under special  certificates of learners at wages lower than the minimum wage applicable  under section 6 of the Act. Part 522 of this chapter contains the  general regulations for learners and those for learners in particular  industries. General learner regulations are set forth in Sec. Sec.  522.1 to 522.11 of this chapter.    Sec. 779.408  ``Full-time students''.</p><p class="depth0">The 1961 Amendments added to section 14 of the Act, the authority to  issue special certificates for the employment of ``full-time students,''  under certain specified conditions, at wages lower than the minimum wage  applicable under section 6. The student, to qualify for a special  certificate   must attend school full time and his employment must be outside of his  school hours and his employment must be in a retail or service  establishment. In addition, the student's employment must not be of the  type ordinarily given to a full-time employee. ``The purpose of this  provision,'' as made clear in the legislative history, ``is to provide  employment opportunities for students who desire to work part time  outside of their school hours without the displacement of adult  workers'' (S. Rept. 145, 87th Cong., first session, p. 29). The  application of this provision was amplified by the 1966 Amendments to  provide for the employment of full-time students regardless of age but  in compliance with applicable child labor laws in retail or service  establishments and in agriculture (not to exceed 20 hours in any  workweek) or on a part-time or a full-time basis during school vacations  at a wage rate not less than 85 percent of the applicable minimum wage  (H. Rept. 1366, 89th Cong., second session, pp. 34 and 35). Regulations  authorizing the issuance of certificates under this provision of the Act  are published in part 519 of this chapter.</p>
