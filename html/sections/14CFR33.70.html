                            <p class="depth0">By a procedure approved by the FAA, operating limitations must be  established which specify the maximum allowable number of flight cycles  for each engine life-limited part. Engine life-limited parts are rotor  and major static structural parts whose primary failure is likely to  result in a hazardous engine effect. Typically, engine life-limited  parts include, but are not limited to disks, spacers, hubs, shafts,  high-pressure casings, and non-redundant mount components. For the  purposes of this section, a hazardous engine effect is any of the  conditions listed in Sec. 33.75 of this part. The applicant will  establish the integrity of each engine life-limited part by:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An engineering plan that contains the steps required to ensure  each engine life-limited part is withdrawn from service at an approved  life before hazardous engine effects can occur. These steps include  validated analysis, test, or service experience which ensures that the  combination of loads, material properties, environmental influences and  operating conditions, including the effects of other engine parts  influencing these parameters, are sufficiently well known and  predictable so that the operating limitations can be established and  maintained for each engine life-limited part. Applicants must perform  appropriate damage tolerance assessments to address the potential for  failure from material, manufacturing, and service induced anomalies  within the approved life of the part. Applicants must publish a list of  the life-limited engine parts and the approved life for each part in the  Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued  Airworthiness as required by Sec. 33.4 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A manufacturing plan that identifies the specific manufacturing  constraints necessary to consistently produce each engine life-limited  part with the attributes required by the engineering plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A service management plan that defines in-service processes for  maintenance and the limitations to repair for each engine life-limited  part that will maintain attributes consistent with those required by the  engineering plan. These processes and limitations will become part of  the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.  [Amdt. 33-22, 72 FR 50860, Sept. 4, 2007]</p>
