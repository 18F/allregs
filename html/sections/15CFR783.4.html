Supplement No. 3 to Part 783--List of Specified Equipment and Non-</p><p class="depth0">Nuclear Material for the Reporting of Imports</p><p class="depth0">1. Reactors and equipment therefor</p><p class="depth0">1.1. Complete nuclear reactors</p><p class="depth0">Nuclear reactors capable of operation so as to maintain a controlled  self-sustaining fission chain reaction, excluding zero energy reactors,  the latter being defined as reactors with a designed maximum rate of  production of plutonium not exceeding 100 grams per year.</p><p class="depth0">Explanatory Note: A ``nuclear reactor'' basically includes the items  within or attached directly to the reactor vessel, the equipment which  controls the level of power in the core, and the components which  normally contain or come in direct contact with or control the primary  coolant of the reactor core. It is not intended to exclude reactors  which could reasonably be capable of modification to produce  significantly more than 100 grams of plutonium per year. Reactors  designed for sustained operation at significant power levels, regardless  of their capacity for plutonium production, are not considered as ``zero  energy reactors.''</p><p class="depth0">1.2. Reactor pressure vessels</p><p class="depth0">Metal vessels, as complete units or as major shop-fabricated parts  therefor, which are specially designed or prepared to contain the core  of a nuclear reactor, as defined in section 1.1, and are capable of  withstanding the operating pressure of the primary coolant.</p><p class="depth0">Explanatory Note: This is the list that the IAEA Board of Governors  agreed at its meeting on 24 February 1993 would be used for the purpose  of the voluntary reporting scheme, as subsequently amended by the Board.  A top plate for a reactor pressure vessel is covered by this section 1.2  as a major shop-fabricated part of a pressure vessel. Reactor internals  (e.g., support columns and plates for the core and other vessel  internals, control rod guide tubes, thermal shields, baffles, core grid  plates, diffuser plates, etc.) are normally supplied by the reactor  supplier. In some cases, certain internal support components are  included in the fabrication of the pressure vessel. These items are  sufficiently critical to the safety and reliability of the operation of  the reactor (and, therefore, to the guarantees and liability of the  reactor supplier), so that their supply, outside the basic supply  arrangement for the reactor itself, would not be common practice.  Therefore, although the separate supply of these unique, specially  designed and prepared, critical, large and expensive items would not  necessarily be considered as falling outside the area of concern, such a  mode of supply is considered unlikely.</p><p class="depth0">1.3. Reactor fuel charging and discharging machines</p><p class="depth0">Manipulative equipment specially designed or prepared for inserting  or removing fuel in a nuclear reactor, as defined in section 1.1 of this  Supplement, capable of on-load operation or employing technically  sophisticated positioning or alignment features to allow complex off- load fueling operations such as those in which direct viewing of or  access to the fuel is not normally available.</p><p class="depth0">1.4. Reactor control rods</p><p class="depth0">Rods specially designed or prepared for the control of the reaction  rate in a nuclear reactor as defined in section 1.1 of this Supplement.</p><p class="depth0">Explanatory Note: This item includes, in addition to the neutron  absorbing part, the support or suspension structures therefor if  supplied separately.</p><p class="depth0">1.5.

Primary coolant pumps</p><p class="depth0">Pumps specially designed or prepared for circulating the primary  coolant for nuclear reactors, as defined in section 1.1 of this  Supplement.</p><p class="depth0">Explanatory Note: Specially designed or prepared pumps may include  elaborate sealed or multi-sealed systems to prevent leakage of primary  coolant, canned-driven pumps, and pumps with inertial mass systems. This  definition encompasses pumps certified to NC-1 or equivalent standards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Non-nuclear materials for reactors</p><p class="depth0">2.1.

Plants for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements, and</p><p class="depth0">equipment specially designed or prepared therefor</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: Reprocessing irradiated nuclear fuel separates  plutonium and uranium from intensely radioactive fission products and  other transuranic elements. Different technical processes can accomplish  this separation. However, over the years Purex has become the most  commonly used and accepted process. Purex involves the dissolution of  irradiated nuclear fuel in nitric acid, followed by separation of the  uranium, plutonium, and fission products by solvent extraction using a  mixture of tributyl phosphate in an organic diluent. Purex facilities  have process functions similar to each other, including: Irradiated fuel  element chopping, fuel dissolution, solvent extraction, and process  liquor storage. There may also be equipment for thermal denitration of  uranium nitrate, conversion of plutonium nitrate to oxide or metal, and  treatment of fission product waste liquor to a form suitable for long  term storage or disposal. However, the specific type and configuration  of the equipment performing these functions may differ between Purex  facilities for several reasons, including the type and quantity of  irradiated nuclear fuel to be reprocessed and the intended disposition  of the recovered materials, and the safety and maintenance philosophy  incorporated into the design of the facility. A ``plant for the  reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements'' includes the equipment and  components which normally come in direct contact with and directly  control the irradiated fuel and the major nuclear material and fission  product processing streams. These processes, including the complete  systems for plutonium conversion and plutonium metal production, may be  identified by the measures taken to avoid criticality (e.g., by  geometry), radiation exposure (e.g., by shielding), and toxicity hazards  (e.g., by containment). Items of equipment that are considered to fall  within the meaning of the phrase ``and equipment specially designed or  prepared'' for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel elements include:</p><p class="depth0">3.1. Irradiated fuel element chopping machines</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: This equipment breaches the cladding of the fuel  to expose the irradiated nuclear material to dissolution. Specially  designed metal cutting shears are the most commonly employed, although  advanced equipment, such as lasers, may be used. Remotely operated  equipment specially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing  plant, as identified in the introductory paragraph of this section, and  intended to cut, chop or shear irradiated nuclear fuel assemblies,  bundles or rods.</p><p class="depth0">3.2. Dissolvers</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: Dissolvers normally receive the chopped-up spent  fuel. In these critically safe vessels, the irradiated nuclear material  is dissolved in nitric acid and the remaining hulls removed from the  process stream. Critically safe tanks (e.g., small diameter, annular or  slab tanks) specially designed or prepared for use in a reprocessing   plant, as identified in the introductory paragraph of this section,  intended for dissolution of irradiated nuclear fuel and which are  capable of withstanding hot, highly corrosive liquid, and which can be  remotely loaded and maintained.</p><p class="depth0">3.3. Solvent extractors and solvent extraction equipment</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: Solvent extractors both receive the solution of  irradiated fuel from the dissolvers and the organic solution which  separates the uranium, plutonium, and fission products. Solvent  extraction equipment is normally designed to meet strict operating  parameters, such as long operating lifetimes with no maintenance  requirements or adaptability to easy replacement, simplicity of  operation and control, and flexibility for variations in process  conditions. Specially designed or prepared solvent extractors such as  packed or pulse columns, mixer settlers or centrifugal contactors for  use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. Solvent  extractors must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric acid.  Solvent extractors are normally fabricated to extremely high standards  (including special welding and inspection and quality assurance and  quality control techniques) out of low carbon stainless steels,  titanium, zirconium, or other high quality materials.</p><p class="depth0">3.4. Chemical holding or storage vessels</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: Three main process liquor streams result from the  solvent extraction step. Holding or storage vessels are used in the  further processing of all three streams, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The pure uranium nitrate solution is concentrated by evaporation  and passed to a denitration process where it is converted to uranium  oxide. This oxide is re-used in the nuclear fuel cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The intensely radioactive fission products solution is normally  concentrated by evaporation and stored as a liquor concentrate. This  concentrate may be subsequently evaporated and converted to a form  suitable for storage or disposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The pure plutonium nitrate solution is concentrated and stored  pending its transfer to further process steps. In particular, holding or  storage vessels for plutonium solutions are designed to avoid  criticality problems resulting from changes in concentration and form of  this stream. Specially designed or prepared holding or storage vessels  for use in a plant for the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. The holding  or storage vessels must be resistant to the corrosive effect of nitric  acid. The holding or storage vessels are normally fabricated of  materials such as low carbon stainless steels, titanium or zirconium, or  other high quality materials. Holding or storage vessels may be designed  for remote operation and maintenance and may have the following features  for control of nuclear criticality: (1) Walls or internal structures  with a boron equivalent of at least two percent; (2) a maximum diameter  of 175 mm (7 in) for cylindrical vessels; or (3) a maximum width of 75  mm (3 in) for either a slab or annular vessel.</p><p class="depth0">3.5. Plutonium nitrate to oxide conversion system</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: In most reprocessing facilities, this final  process involves the conversion of the plutonium nitrate solution to  plutonium dioxide. The main functions involved in this process are:  process feed storage and adjustment, precipitation and solid/liquor  separation, calcination, product handling, ventilation, waste  management, and process control. Complete systems specially designed or  prepared for the conversion of plutonium nitrate to plutonium oxide, in  particular adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and  to minimize toxicity hazards.</p><p class="depth0">3.6. Plutonium oxide to metal production system</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: This process, which could be related to a  reprocessing facility, involves the fluorination of plutonium dioxide,  normally with highly corrosive hydrogen fluoride, to produce plutonium  fluoride which is subsequently reduced using high purity calcium metal  to produce metallic plutonium and a calcium fluoride slag. The main  functions involved in this process are: fluorination (e.g., involving  equipment fabricated or lined with a precious metal), metal reduction  (e.g., employing ceramic crucibles), slag recovery, product handling,  ventilation, waste management and process control. Complete systems  specially designed or prepared for the production of plutonium metal, in  particular adapted so as to avoid criticality and radiation effects and  to minimize toxicity hazards.</p><p class="depth0">4. Plants for the fabrication of fuel elements</p><p class="depth0">A ``plant for the fabrication of fuel elements'' includes the  equipment:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which normally comes in direct contact with, or directly  processes, or controls, the production flow of nuclear material, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Which seals the nuclear material within the cladding.  5. Plants for the separation of isotopes of uranium and equipment, other</p><p class="depth0">than analytical instruments, specially designed or prepared therefor</p><p class="depth0">Items of equipment that are considered to fall within the meaning of  the phrase   ``equipment, other than analytical instruments, specially designed or  prepared'' for the separation of isotopes of uranium include:  5.1. Gas centrifuges and assemblies and components specially designed or</p><p class="depth0">prepared for use in gas centrifuges</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: The gas centrifuge normally consists of a thin- walled cylinder(s) of between 75 mm (3 in) and 400 mm (16 in) diameter  contained in a vacuum environment and spun at high peripheral speed of  the order of 300 m/s or more with its central axis vertical. In order to  achieve high speed the materials of construction for the rotating  components have to be of a high strength to density ratio and the rotor  assembly, and hence its individual components, have to be manufactured  to very close tolerances in order to minimize the unbalance. In contrast  to other centrifuges, the gas centrifuge for uranium enrichment is  characterized by having within the rotor chamber a rotating disc-shaped  baffle(s) and a stationary tube arrangement for feeding and extracting  the UF6 gas and featuring at least 3 separate channels, of  which 2 are connected to scoops extending from the rotor axis towards  the periphery of the rotor chamber. Also contained within the vacuum  environment are a number of critical items which do not rotate and which  although they are specially designed are not difficult to fabricate nor  are they fabricated out of unique materials. A centrifuge facility  however requires a large number of these components, so that quantities  can provide an important indication of end use.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1. Rotating components</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Complete rotor assemblies: Thin-walled cylinders, or a number of  interconnected thin-walled cylinders, manufactured from one or more of  the high strength to density ratio materials described in the  Explanatory Note to section 5.1.1 of this supplement. If interconnected,  the cylinders are joined together by flexible bellows or rings as  described in section 5.1.1(c) of this supplement.

Specially designed or prepared systems, equipment and components</p><p class="depth0">for use in chemical exchange or ion exchange enrichment plants</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: The slight difference in mass between the  isotopes of uranium causes small changes in chemical reaction equilibria  that can be used as a basis for separation of the isotopes. Two  processes have been successfully developed: Liquid-liquid chemical  exchange and solid-liquid ion exchange. In the liquid-liquid chemical  exchange process, immiscible liquid phases (aqueous and organic) are  countercurrently contacted to give the cascading effect of thousands of  separation stages. The aqueous phase consists of uranium chloride in  hydrochloric acid solution; the organic phase consists of an extractant  containing uranium chloride in an organic solvent. The contactors  employed in the separation cascade can be liquid-liquid exchange columns  (such as pulsed columns with sieve plates) or liquid centrifugal  contactors. Chemical conversions (oxidation and reduction) are required  at both ends of the separation cascade in order to provide for the  reflux requirements at each end. A major design concern is to avoid  contamination of the process streams with certain metal ions. Plastic,  plastic-lined (including use of fluorocarbon polymers) and/or glass- lined columns and piping are therefore used. In the solid-liquid ion- exchange process, enrichment is accomplished by uranium adsorption/ desorption on a special, very fast-acting, ion-exchange resin or  adsorbent. A solution of uranium in hydrochloric acid and other chemical  agents is passed through cylindrical enrichment columns containing  packed beds of the adsorbent. For a continuous process, a reflux system  is necessary to release the uranium from the adsorbent back into the  liquid flow so that ``product'' and ``tails'' can be collected. This is  accomplished with the use of suitable reduction/oxidation chemical  agents that are fully regenerated in separate external circuits and that  may be partially regenerated within the isotopic separation columns  themselves. The presence of hot concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions  in the process requires that the equipment be made of or protected by  special corrosion-resistant materials.</p><p class="depth0">5.6.1.

Liquid-liquid centrifugal contactors (Chemical exchange)</p><p class="depth0">Liquid-liquid centrifugal contactors specially designed or prepared  for uranium enrichment using the chemical exchange process.

Plants for the production of heavy water, deuterium and deuterium</p><p class="depth0">compounds and equipment specially designed or prepared therefor</p><p class="depth0">Introductory Note: Heavy water can be produced by a variety of  processes. However, the two processes that have proven to be  commercially viable are the water-hydrogen sulphide exchange process (GS  process) and the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process. The GS process is  based upon the exchange of hydrogen and deuterium between water and  hydrogen sulphide within a series of towers which are operated with the  top section cold and the bottom section hot. Water flows down the towers  while the hydrogen sulphide gas circulates from the bottom to the top of  the towers. A series of perforated trays are used to promote mixing  between the gas and the water. Deuterium migrates to the water at low  temperatures and to the hydrogen sulphide at high temperatures. Gas or  water, enriched in deuterium, is removed from the first stage towers at  the junction of the hot and cold sections and the process is repeated in  subsequent stage towers. The product of the last stage, water enriched  up to 30% in deuterium, is sent to a distillation unit to produce  reactor grade heavy water, i.e., 99.75% deuterium oxide. The ammonia- hydrogen exchange process can extract deuterium from synthesis gas  through contact with liquid ammonia in the presence of a catalyst. The  synthesis gas is fed into exchange towers and to an ammonia converter.   Inside the towers the gas flows from the bottom to the top while the  liquid ammonia flows from the top to the bottom. The deuterium is  stripped from the hydrogen in the synthesis gas and concentrated in the  ammonia. The ammonia then flows into an ammonia cracker at the bottom of  the tower while the gas flows into an ammonia converter at the top.  Further enrichment takes place in subsequent stages and reactor grade  heavy water is produced through final distillation. The synthesis gas  feed can be provided by an ammonia plant that, in turn, can be  constructed in association with a heavy water ammonia-hydrogen exchange  plant. The ammonia-hydrogen exchange process can also use ordinary water  as a feed source of deuterium.</p><p class="depth0">Many of the key equipment items for heavy water production plants  using GS or the ammonia-hydrogen exchange processes are common to  several segments of the chemical and petroleum industries. This is  particularly so for small plants using the GS process. However, few of  the items are available ``off-the-shelf.'' The GS and ammonia-hydrogen  processes require the handling of large quantities of flammable,  corrosive and toxic fluids at elevated pressures. Accordingly, in  establishing the design and operating standards for plants and equipment  using these processes, careful attention to the materials selection and  specifications is required to ensure long service life with high safety  and reliability factors. The choice of scale is primarily a function of  economics and need. Thus, most of the equipment items would be prepared  according to the requirements of the customer. Finally, it should be  noted that, in both the GS and the ammonia-hydrogen exchange processes,  items of equipment which individually are not specially designed or  prepared for heavy water production can be assembled into systems which  are specially designed or prepared for producing heavy water. The  catalyst production system used in the ammonia-hydrogen exchange process  and water distillation systems used for the final concentration of heavy  water to reactor-grade in either process are examples of such systems.
