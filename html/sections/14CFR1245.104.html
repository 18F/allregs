Normally, the reservations of Sec. 1245.107(a), License to the Government, and Sec. 1245.107(b), March-in rights, will apply. However, should one or more of the situations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3), of this section exist, rather than denying the advance waiver request, the Board may recommend restricting or eliminating only part of the rights of the contractor to the extent necessary to address the particular situation, consistent with the policy and goals of Sec. 1245.103.

Such election will be made by notification in writing to the patent representative designated in the contract. Title to all other inventions made under the contract are subject to section 305(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2457(a).

made without unduly delaying execution of the contract, the Board will inform the contracting officer that no recommendation has been made and the reasons therefor. The contracting officer will then notify the petitioner of the Board's action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> After notification by the contracting officer under paragraph (d) of this section, the petitioner may, upon its execution of the contract, or within 30 days, request the Board to reconsider the matter under paragraph (b) of this section either on the record or with any additional statements submitted in the subpart of the original petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A waiver granted pursuant to a petition submitted under this section shall extend to any contract changes, modifications, or supplemental agreements, so long as the purpose of the contract or the scope of work to be performed is not substantially changed.</p>
