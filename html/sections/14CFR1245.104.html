                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of domestic rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions which may be made under a contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The NASA Inventions and Contributions Board normally will recommend grant of a request for advance waiver of domestic rights submitted prior to execution of contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract unless the Board finds that the interests of the United States will be better served by restricting or denying all or part of the requested rights in one or more of the following situations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the contractor is not located in the United States or does not have a place of business in the United States or is subject to the control of a foreign government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a determination has been made by Government authority which is authorized by statute or Executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or counter-intelligence activities that the restriction or denial of the requested rights to any inventions made in the performance of work under the contract is necessary to protect the security of such activities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such that restriction or denial of the requested rights will better promote one or more of the following objectives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Promoting the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research and development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Encouraging maximum participation of industry in federally-supported research and development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensuring that inventions are used in a manner to promote free competition and enterprise;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Promoting the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States industry and labor; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Ensuring that the Government retains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> An advance waiver, when granted, will be subject to the reservations set forth in Sec. 1245.107. Normally, the reservations of Sec. 1245.107(a), License to the Government, and Sec. 1245.107(b), March-in rights, will apply. However, should one or more of the situations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3), of this section exist, rather than denying the advance waiver request, the Board may recommend granting to the contractor only part of the requested rights, to the extent necessary to address the particular situation, consistent with the policy and goals of Sec. 1245.103. In that event, the waiver grant will be subject to additional reservations as provided for in Sec. 1245.107(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An advance waiver, when granted, will be subject to the reservations set forth in Sec. 1245.107. Normally, the reservations of Sec. 1245.107(a), License to the Government, and Sec. 1245.107(b), March-in rights, will apply.

In that event, the waiver grant will be subject to additional reservations as provided for in Sec. 1245.107(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To meet the National Aeronautics and Space Act standard of ``any invention or class of inventions,'' for advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention(s) and/or class(es) of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver of rights is being requested. Therefore, the petition must be directed to a specific invention(s) or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly drawn, focused area(s) of technology.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An advance waiver, when granted, will apply only to inventions reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and a designation made within 6 months of the time of reporting (or a reasonable time thereafter permitted for good cause shown) that the contractor elects title to the invention and intends to file or has filed a U.S. patent application. Such election will be made by notification in writing to the patent representative designated in the contract. Title to all other inventions made under the contract are subject to section 20135(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 51 U.S.C. 20135(b)(1). The granting of the advance waiver does not otherwise relieve a contractor of any of the invention identification or reporting requirements set forth in the applicable patent rights clause in the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The advance waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in any patent application filed on the reported invention, including any subsequent divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the claims of the subsequent application do not substantially change the scope of the reported invention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a petition for waiver is submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, prior to contract execution, it will be processed expeditiously so that a decision on the petition may be reached prior to execution of the contract. However, if there is insufficient time or insufficient information is presented, or for other reasons which do not permit a recommendation to be made without unduly delaying execution of the contract, the Board will inform the contracting officer that no recommendation can be made prior to contract execution and the reasons therefor. The contracting officer will then notify the petitioner of the Board's action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A waiver granted pursuant to a petition submitted under this section shall extend to any contract changes, modifications, or supplemental agreements, so long as the purpose of the contract or the scope of work to be performed is not substantially changed.
