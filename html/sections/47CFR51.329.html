All subsequent filings responsive to a notice may be filed using the Commission's ECFS under the docket number set forth in the Commission's public notice for the proceeding. Subsequent filings responsive to a notice also may be filed by sending one paper copy of the filing to ``Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC

All subsequent filings responsive to a notice shall refer to the ECFS docket number assigned to the notice.
