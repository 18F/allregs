(The U.S. will be governed by pertinent provisions of the Social  Security Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Tax  Reform Act, and other related statutes.) In negotiating an agreement,  consideration, should be given to the compatibility of the other  country's laws on confidentiality and disclosure to those of the U.S. To  the extent possible, information exchanged between the U.S. and the  foreign country should be used exclusively for purposes of implementing  the agreement and the laws to which the agreement pertains.</p>
