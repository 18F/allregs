                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement and certifying official: All reports submitted to EIA must include a certification statement, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, signed by a certifying official of the reporting entity. A household report may be certified by one of its members. All other reports must be certified by the chief executive officer, agency head, or an officer or employee of the entity who is responsible for reporting the entity's compliance with environmental regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification statement requirements. All entities, whether reporting or registering reductions, must certify the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information reported is accurate and complete;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information reported has been compiled in accordance with this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The information reported is consistent with information submitted in prior years, if any, or any inconsistencies with prior year's information are documented and explained in the entity statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional requirements for registering. The certification statement of an entity registering reductions must also certify that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The entity took reasonable steps to ensure that direct emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration reported are neither double counted nor reported by any other entity. Reasonable steps include telephone, fax, letter, or e-mail communications to ensure that another entity does not intend to report the same emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration to DOE. Direct communications of this kind with participants in demand-side management or other programs directed at very small emitters are not required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any emission reductions reported or registered by the entity that were achieved by another entity (other than a very small emitter that participated in a demand-side management or other program) are included in the entity's report only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The other entity does not intend to report or register theses reductions directly;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There exists a written agreement with each other entity providing that the reporting entity is the entity entitled to report or register these emission reductions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The information reported on the other entity would meet the requirements of this part if the entity were reporting directly to DOE;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> None of the emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration reported were produced by shifting emissions to other entities or to non-reporting parts of the entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> None of any reported changes in avoided emissions associated with the sale of electricity, steam, hot or chilled water generated from non-emitting or low-emitting sources are attributable to the acquisition of a generating facility that has been previously operated, unless the entity's base period includes generation values from the acquiring facility's operation prior to its acquisition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The entity maintains records documenting the analysis and calculations underpinning the data reported on this form and records documenting the analysis and calculations underpinning the base values used in calculating annual reductions are maintained in accordance with Sec. 300.9(d) of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The entity has, or has not, obtained independent verification of the report, as described in Sec. 300.11.</p>
