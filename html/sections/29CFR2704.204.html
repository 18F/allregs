                            <p class="depth0">Ordinarily, the net-worth and annual-receipts exhibits will be  included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant  that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of such  exhibits and believes there are legal grounds for withholding the  information from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit  directly to the administrative law judge in a sealed envelope labeled  ``Confidential Financial Information,'' accompanied by a motion to  withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall  describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail,  why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from  mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely  affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public  interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel  representing the Secretary of Labor against whom the applicant seeks an  award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If  the administrative law judge finds that the information should not be  withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the  proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall  be disposed of in accordance with the established procedures under the  Freedom of Information Act (29 CFR part 2702).</p>
