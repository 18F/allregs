                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Grants will be made to assist in establishing new economic enterprises, or in purchasing or expanding established ones. However, a grant may be made only when in the opinion of the Assistant Secretary the applicant is unable to obtain adequate financing from other sources. Prior to making any grant, the Assistant Secretary shall assure that, to the extent practical, the applicant's own resources have been invested in the proposed project. The applicant shall not be required to invest own resources to the extent that they are already committed to endeavors deemed by the Assistant Secretary to be essential to the welfare of the applicant. If the information in an application, which must include personal financial statements, indicates that it may be possible for the applicant to obtain financing without a grant, the Assistant Secretary will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area, if available, who are making loans for similar purpose, showing whether or not they will make a loan to the applicant for the total financing needed without a grant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A grant may be made only to an applicant who is able to obtain at least 75 percent of the necessary financing from other sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No grant in excess of $250,000 may be made to an Indian tribe or in excess of $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revolving loan funds as prescribed in title I of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 and guaranteed or insured loans as prescribed in title II of said Act may not be used as the sources of the loan portion of the total financing requirement if financing from other governmental or institutional lenders is available on reasonable terms and conditions. If a loan is not available from other sources, guaranteed or insured loans under the provisions of title II of said Act may then be considered. If a guaranteed or insured loan is not available loans under the provisions of title I of said Act may then be considered. Applicants for a loan from either source must meet the eligibility requirements for such loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A grant will not be approved unless there is assurance the applicant can and will be provided with needed competent technical and management assistance commensurate with the nature of the enterprise to be funded and the knowledge and management skills of the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grant funds may not be used for refinancing or debt consolidation unless approval is justified and required

due to the applicant's financial position and is clearly to the advantage of the grant applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ordinarily, not more than one grant will be made for a project. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances a second grant may be made to applicants for a new project or expansion of the original project. An additional grant will not be approved for an economic enterprise previously funded under the provisions of title IV of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 except for expanding a successful enterprise, provided the total of grants made shall not exceed $250,000 to an Indian tribe and $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An application for a second grant will not be approved if the applicant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has not complied with the reporting requirements in connection with the first grant, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has not followed the plan of operation, if any, developed for the management and operation of the economic enterprise, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Did not follow and use the management and technical assistance furnished, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Is in violation of one or more provisions of the loan agreement entered into between the applicant and the lender who furnished the loan portion of the financing in connection with the first grant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An applicant for an expansion grant must meet the same eligibility requirements as an original applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A grantee will be required to return all or a portion of the grant if the business or enterprise for which the grant was utilized is sold within three years of the date on which the grant was disbursed to the grantee, unless the proceeds from the sale are re-invested in a new business or business expansion which will benefit the Indian reservation economy. Such sale and re-investment must have the prior approval of the local agency superintendent. The grantee shall refund the lessor of the grant amount or a pro rata portion of sales proceeds. The pro rata portion of sales proceeds shall be based on the ratio of grant amount to its corresponding matching financing. The new business or business expansion utilizing such sale proceeds must meet the same criteria for eligibility as an original grant.
