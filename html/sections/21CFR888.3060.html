                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A spinal intervertebral body fixation orthosis is a device intended to be implanted made of titanium. It consists of various vertebral plates that are punched into each of a series of vertebral bodies. An eye-type screw is inserted in a hole in the center of each of the plates. A braided cable is threaded through each eye-type screw. The cable is tightened with a tension device and it is fastened or crimped at each eye-type screw. The device is used to apply force to a series of vertebrae to correct ``sway back,'' scoliosis (lateral curvature of the spine), or other conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
