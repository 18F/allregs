                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The steps set forth below are the steps the Commission has  determined are reasonable to take to assure disclosure of information to  the public is fair in the circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission will accompany information disclosed to the  public with the manufacturer's or private labeler's comments unless the  manufacturer or private labeler asks in its section 6(b) comments that  its comments or a designated portion thereof not accompany the  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission generally will accompany the disclosure of  information with an explanatory statement that makes the nature of the  information disclosed clear to the public. The Commission will also take  reasonable steps to disclose any other relevant information it its  possession that will assure disclosure is fair in the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission will limit the form of disclosure to that which  it considers appropriate in the circumstances. For example, the  Commission may determine it is not appropriate to issue a nationwide  press release in a particular situation and rather will issue a press  release directed at certain localities, regions, or user populations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission may delay disclosure of information in some  circumstances. For example, the Commission may elect to postpone an  information release until an investigation, analysis or test of a  product is complete, rather than releasing information piecemeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission will not disclose information when it determines  that disclosure would not be fair in the circumstances. The following  are examples of disclosures which generally would not be fair in the  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosure of information furnished by a firm to facilitate  prompt remedial action or settlement of a case when the firm has a  reasonable expectation that the information will be maintained by the  Commission in concidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosure of notes or minutes of meetings to discuss or  negotiate settlement agreements and of drafts of documents prepared  during settlement negotiations, where the firm has a reasonable  expectation that such written materials will be maintained by the  Commission in confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the work-product of attorneys employed by a firm  and information subject to an attorney/client privilege, if the  Commission has obtained the information from the client or the attorney,  the attorney or client advises the Commission of the confidential nature  of the information at the time it is submitted to the Commission, and  the information has been maintained in confidence by the client and the  attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure of a firm's comments (or a portion thereof) submitted  under section 6(b)(1) over the firm's objection.</p>
