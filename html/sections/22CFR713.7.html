OPIC may consider various factors in reviewing a request for nonpublic records or testimony of OPIC employees, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether disclosure would assist or hinder OPIC in performing its statutory duties or use OPIC resources unreasonably, including whether responding to the request will interfere with OPIC employees' ability to do their work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether disclosure is necessary to prevent the perpetration of a fraud or other injustice in the matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether you can get the records or testimony you want from sources other than OPIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the request is unduly burdensome.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, or regulation, such as the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, or would otherwise be inappropriate for release and, if so, whether a confidentiality agreement or protective order as provided in Sec. 713.9(a) can adequately limit the disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Whether the disclosure would interfere with law enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, or hamper OPIC programs or other OPIC operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Whether the disclosure could result in OPIC's appearing to favor one litigant over another.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any other factors OPIC determines to be relevant to the interests of OPIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review of your request. OPIC will process your request in the order it is received. OPIC will try to respond to your request within 45 days, but this may vary, depending on the scope of your request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final determination. the Vice-President/General Counsel makes the final determination on requests for nonpublic records or OPIC employee testimony. All final determinations are in the sole discretion of the Vice-President/General Counsel. The Vice-President/General Counsel will notify you and the court or other authority of the final determination of your request. In considering your request, the Vice-President/General Counsel may contact you to inform you of the requirements of this part, ask that the request or subpoena be modified or withdrawn, or may try to resolve the request or subpoena informally without issuing a final determination.</p>
