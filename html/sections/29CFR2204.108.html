However,  the Commission retains its right to consider an application for an award  of fees and expenses without assignment to a judge or to assign such an  application to a judge other than the one to whom the underlying OSH Act  case is assigned. When entertaining an application for an award of fees  and expenses pursuant to this section, each judge is authorized to take  any action that the Commission may take under this part, with the  exception of actions provided in Secs. 2204.309 and 2204.310.
