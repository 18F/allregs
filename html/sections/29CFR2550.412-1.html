                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the  bonding requirements of the Act if he or she is bonded under a bond  which would have been in compliance with section 13 of the Welfare and  Pension Plans Disclosure Act, as amended (the WPPDA), and with the basic  bonding requirements of subparts A through E of part 2580, title 29 CFR,  and with the prohibition against bonding by parties interested in the  plan contained in subpart G of part 2580 of such title, or would be  exempt from such bonding requirements because bonding would not be  required under the exemption provisions contained in subpart F of part  2580 of such title. Part 2580 of this title incorporates material  previously designated as subparts A through E of part 464, subpart B of  part 465 and part 485 of this title of the CFR. The requirements which  are set forth in the temporary regulations hereby adopted shall be  applicable to all employee benefit plans covered by the Act, including  those plans which were not covered by the WPPDA. Thus, for example, the  regulations so adopted are applicable to plans containing fewer than 26  participants, although such plans were not covered by the WPPDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of this temporary regulation, any bond or rider  thereto obtained by a plan official which contains a reference to the  WPPDA will be construed by the Secretary to refer to the Act: Provided,  That the surety company so agrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of this regulation,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any reference to section 13 of the WPPDA or any subsection  thereof in the regulations issued under the WPPDA and which are  incorporated by reference by this temporary regulation shall be deemed  to refer to section 412 of the Act, or the corresponding subsection  thereof,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the particular phrases set forth in the Act are not  identical to the phrases in the WPPDA and the regulations issued  pursuant thereto, the phrases appearing in the Act shall be substituted  by operation of law, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the phrases are identical but the meaning is different,  the meaning given such phrases by the Act shall govern. For example, the  phrase ``administrators, officers, and employees of any employee welfare  benefit plan or of any employee pension benefit plan subject to this Act  who handle funds or other property of such plan'' which appears in  section 13 of the WPPDA and the regulations issued thereunder shall be  construed to mean, for purposes of this regulation, ``plan officials'',  which   is the term appearing in section 412 of the Act, and the terms  ``employee welfare benefit plan'' and ``employee pension benefit plan''  shall be given the meaning assigned to them by the Act, and not the  meaning set forth in the WPPDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requirements of this temporary regulation, as set forth in  paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, shall remain in effect  pending the issuance of permanent regulations by the Secretary.
