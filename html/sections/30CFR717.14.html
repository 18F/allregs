                                Sec. 717.14  Backfilling and grading of road cuts, mine entry
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon completion of underground mining, surface work areas which  are involved in excavation, disposal of materials, or otherwise  affected, shall be regraded to approximate original contour. The  permittee shall transport, backfill and compact fill material to assure  stability or to prevent leaching of toxic pollutants. Barren rock or  similar materials excess to the mining operations and which are disposed  on the land surface shall be subject to the provision of Sec. 717.15 of  this part. Roads and support facility areas existing prior to the  effective date of this part and used in support of underground mining  operations which are subject to this part shall be regraded to the  extent deemed feasible by the regulatory authority based on the  availability of   backfill material and resulting stability of the affected lands after  reclamation. As a minimum, the permittee shall be required to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retain all earth, rock and other mineral nonwaste materials on  the solid portion of existing or new benches, except that the regulatory  authority may permit placement of such material at the site of the  faceup as a means of disposing of excavated spoil when additional  working space is needed to facilitate operations. Such placement of  material shall be limited to minimize disturbance of land and to the  hydrologic balance. Such fills shall be stabilized with vegetation and  shall achieve a minimum static safety factor of 1.5. In no case shall  the outslope exceed the angle of repose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Backfill and grade to the most moderate slope possible to  eliminate any highwall along roads, mine entry faces or other areas.  Slopes shall not exceed the angle of repose or such lesser slopes as  required by the regulatory authority to maintain stability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On approval by the regulatory authority and in order to conserve  soil moisture, ensure stability, and control erosion on final graded  slopes, cut-and-fill terraces may be allowed if the terraces are  appropriate substitutes for construction of lower grades on the  reclaimed lands. The terraces shall meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The width of the individual terrace bench shall not exceed 20  feet unless specifically approved by the regulatory authority as  necessary for stability erosion control, or roads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vertical distance between terraces shall be as specified by  the regulatory authority to prevent excessive erosion and to provide  long/term stability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The slope of the terrace outslope shall not exceed 1v:2h (50  percent). Outslopes which exceed 1v:2h (50 percent) may be approved if  they have a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 of more and provide  adequate control over erosion and closely resemble the surface  configuration of the land prior to mining. In no case may highwalls be  left as part of terraces.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Culverts and underground rock drains shall be used on the  terrace only when approved by the regulatory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All surface operations on steep slopes of 20 degrees or more or  on such lesser slopes as the regulatory authority define as a steep  slope shall be conducted so as not to place any material on the  downslope below road cuts, mine working or other benches, other than in  conformance with paragraph (a)(1) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regrading or stabilizing rills and gullies. When rills or  gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas that have been regraded and  the topsoil replaced but vegetation has not yet been established, the  permittee shall fill, grade, or otherwise stabilize the rills and  gullies and reseed or replant the areas according to Sec. 717.20. The  regulatory authority shall specify that erosional features of lesser  size be stabilized if they result in additional erosion and  sedimentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Covering coal and acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible, and  other waste materials; stabilizing backfilled materials; and using waste  material for fill. Any acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible  materials, or any other waste materials as identified by the regulatory  authority that are exposed, used, or produced during underground mining  and which are deposited on the land surface shall, after placement in  accordance with Sec. 717.15 of this part, be covered with a minimum of  4 feet of nontoxic and noncombustible material; or, if necessary,  treated to neutralize toxicity, in order to prevent water pollution and  sustained combustion, and to minimize adverse effects on plant growth  and land uses. Where necessary to protect against upward migration of  salts, exposure by erosion, to provide an adequate depth for plant  growth, or to otherwise meet local conditions, the regulatory authority  shall specify thicker amount of cover using nontoxic material. Acid- forming or toxic-forming material shall not be buried or stored in  proximity to a drainage course so as to cause or pose a threat of water  pollution or otherwise violate the provisions of Sec. 717.17 of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Grading along the contour. All final grading, preparation of  earth, rock and other nonwaste materials before replacement of topsoil,  and placement of   topsoil in accordance with Sec. 717.20, shall be done along the contour  to minimize subsequent erosion and instability. If such grading,  preparation or placement along the contour would be hazardous to  equipment operators, grading, preparation or placement in a direction  other than generally parallel to the contour may be used. In all cases,  grading, preparation or placement shall be conducted in a manner which  minimizes erosion and provides a surface for replacement of topsoil  which will minimize slippage.</p>
