                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This License Exception authorizes various temporary exports and reexports; exports and reexports of items temporarily in the United States; and exports and reexports of beta test software.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Temporary exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country). License Exception TMP authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items for temporary use abroad (including use in or above international waters) subject to the conditions specified in this paragraph (a). No item may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a) if an order to acquire the item, such as a purchase order, has been received before shipment; with prior knowledge that the item will stay abroad beyond the terms of this License Exception; or when the item is for subsequent lease or rental abroad. The references to various countries and country groups in these TMP-specific provisions do not limit or amend the prohibitions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR on the use of license exceptions generally, such as for exports of 9x515 or ``600 series'' items to destinations in Country Group D:5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tools of trade. Exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of commodities and software as tools of trade for use by the exporter or employees of the exporter may be made only to destinations other than Country Group E:1; for Sudan, see paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The tools of trade must remain under the ``effective control'' of the exporter or the exporter's employee. Eligible items are usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of tools of trade for use in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of the exporter. Tools of trade include, but are not limited to, commodities and software as is necessary to commission or service items, provided that the commodity or software is appropriate for this purpose and that all items to be commissioned or serviced are of foreign origin, or if subject to the EAR, have been lawfully exported, reexported, or transferred. Tools of trade may accompany the individual departing from the United States or may be shipped unaccompanied within one month before the individual's departure from the United States, or at any time after departure. Software used as a tool of trade must be protected against unauthorized access. Examples of security precautions to help prevent unauthorized access include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for activities that involve the transmission and use of the software authorized under this license exception;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use of password systems on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sudan: Tools of Trade--(i) Permissible users. A non-governmental organization or an individual staff member, employee or contractor of such organization traveling to Sudan at the direction or with the knowledge of such organization may export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) under this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permissible users. A non-governmental organization or an individual staff member, employee or contractor of such organization traveling to Sudan at the direction or with the knowledge of such organization may export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) under this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Authorized purposes. Any tools of trade exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph must be used to support activities to implement the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur; to provide humanitarian or development assistance in

Sudan, to support activities to relieve human suffering in Sudan, or to support the actions in Sudan for humanitarian or development purposes; by an organization authorized by the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) pursuant to 31 CFR 538.521 in support of its OFAC-authorized activities; or to support the activities to relieve human suffering in Sudan in areas that are exempt from the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations by virtue of the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act and Executive Order 13412.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Method of export and maintenance of control. The tools of trade must accompany (either hand carried or as checked baggage) a traveler who is a permissible user of this provision or be shipped or transmitted to such user by a method reasonably calculated to assure delivery to the permissible user of this provision. The permissible user of this provision must maintain ``effective control'' of the tools of trade while in Sudan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Eligible items. The only tools of trade that may be exported, reexported or transferred (in-country) to Sudan under this paragraph (a)(2) are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Commodities controlled under ECCNs 4A994.b and ``software'' controlled under ECCNs 4D994 or 5D992 to be used on such commodities. Software must either be loaded onto the commodities prior to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) or be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) solely for servicing or in-kind replacement of legally exported or reexported software. All such software must remain loaded on the commodities while in Sudan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Telecommunications equipment controlled under ECCN 5A991 and ``software'' controlled under ECCN 5D992 to be used in the operation of such equipment. Software must be loaded onto such equipment prior to export or be exported or reexported solely for servicing or in-kind replacement of legally exported or reexported software. All such software must remain loaded on such equipment while in Sudan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Global positioning systems (GPS) or similar satellite receivers controlled under ECCN 7A994; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Commodities that are controlled under ECCN 5A992, including commodities that are installed with, or contained in, commodities in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section and that remain installed with or contained in such commodities while in Sudan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tools of trade: temporary exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of technology by U.S. persons. (i) This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of technology for use in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of a U.S. person to destinations other than Country Group E:1. Only U.S. persons or their employees traveling or on temporary assignment abroad may export, reexport, transfer (in-country) or receive technology under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of technology for use in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of a U.S. person to destinations other than Country Group E:1. Only U.S. persons or their employees traveling or on temporary assignment abroad may export, reexport, transfer (in-country) or receive technology under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Because this paragraph (a)(3) does not authorize any new release of technology, employees traveling or on temporary assignment abroad who are not U.S. persons may only receive under TMP such technology abroad that they are already eligible to receive through a current license, a license exception other than TMP, or because no license is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A U.S. employer of individuals who are not U.S. persons must demonstrate and document for recordkeeping purposes the reason that the technology is needed by such employees in their temporary business activities abroad on behalf of the U.S. person employer, prior to using this paragraph (a)(3). This documentation must be created and maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The U.S. person must retain supervision over the technology that has been authorized for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) under these or other provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The exporting, reexporting, or transferring party and the recipient of the technology must take security precautions to protect against unauthorized release of the technology while the technology is being shipped or transmitted and used overseas. Examples of security precautions to help prevent

unauthorized access include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for email and other business activities that involve the transmission and use of the technology authorized under this license exception;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use of password systems on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Technology authorized under these provisions may not be used for foreign production purposes or for technical assistance unless authorized by BIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Encryption technology controlled by ECCN 5E002 is ineligible for this license exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Kits consisting of replacement parts or components. Kits consisting of replacement parts or components may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to all destinations except Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The parts and components would qualify for shipment under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section if exported as one-for-one replacements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The kits remain under effective control of the exporter or an employee of the exporter; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All parts and components in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License Exception RPL and the defective parts and components returned (see Parts, Components, Accessories and Attachments in Sec. 740.10(a) of this part).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exhibition and demonstration. This paragraph (a)(5) authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of commodities and software for exhibition or demonstration in all destinations except Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) provided that the exporter maintains ownership of the commodities and software while they are abroad and provided that the exporter, an employee of the exporter, or the exporter's designated sales representative retains ``effective control'' over the commodities and software while they are abroad. The commodities and software may not be used when abroad for more than the minimum extent required for effective demonstration. The commodities and software may not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one site for longer than 120 days after installation and debugging, unless authorized by BIS. However, before or after an exhibition or demonstration, pending movement to another site, return to the United States or the foreign reexporter, or BIS approval for other disposition, the commodities and software may be placed in a bonded warehouse or a storage facility provided that the exporter retains ``effective control'' over their disposition. The export documentation for this type of transaction must show the exporter as ultimate consignee, in care of the person who will have control over the commodities and software abroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Inspection, test, calibration, and repair. Commodities to be inspected, tested, calibrated, or repaired abroad may be exported, reexported, and transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a)(6) to all destinations except Country Group E:1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Containers. Containers for which another license exception is not available and that are necessary for shipment of commodities may be exported, reexported, and transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a)(7). However, this paragraph does not authorize the export of the container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be separately authorized for export under either a license exception or a license.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Assembly in Mexico. Commodities may be exported to Mexico under Customs entries that require return to the United States after processing, assembly, or incorporation into end products by companies, factories, or facilities participating in Mexico's in-bond industrialization program (Maquiladora) under this paragraph (a)(8), provided that all resulting end-products (or the commodities themselves) are returned to the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> News media. (i) Commodities necessary for news-gathering purposes (and software necessary to use such commodities) may be temporarily exported or reexported for accredited news media personnel (i.e., persons with credentials from a news-gathering or reporting firm) to Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the commodities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Commodities necessary for news-gathering purposes (and software necessary to use such commodities) may be temporarily exported or reexported for accredited news media personnel (i.e., persons with credentials from a news-gathering or reporting firm) to Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the commodities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Are retained under ``effective control'' of the exporting news-gathering firm in the country of destination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Remain in the physical possession of the news media personnel in the country of destination. The term physical possession for purposes of this paragraph (a)(9) means maintaining effective measures to prevent unauthorized access (e.g., securing equipment in locked facilities or hiring security guards to protect the equipment); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Are removed with the news media personnel at the end of the trip.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When exporting under this paragraph (a)(9) from the United States, the exporter must email a copy of the packing list or similar identification of the exported commodities, to bis.compliance@bis.doc.gov specifying the destination and estimated dates of departure and return. The Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) may check returns to assure that the provisions of this paragraph (a)(9) are being used properly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Commodities or software necessary for news-gathering purposes that accompany news media personnel to all other destinations shall be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under paragraph (a)(1), tools of trade, of this section if owned by the news gathering firm, or if they are personal property of the individual news media personnel. Note that paragraphs (a)(1), tools of trade, and (a)(9), news media, of this section do not preclude independent accredited contract personnel, who are under control of news-gathering firms while on assignment, from using these provisions, provided that the news gathering firm designates an employee of the contract firm to be responsible for the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Temporary exports to a U.S. person's foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or facility abroad.
