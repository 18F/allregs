                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The Office of Government Ethics may use its statutory  authority to solicit, accept and utilize gifts to the agency that aid or  facilitate the agency's work. The authority to solicit, accept and  utilize gifts includes the authority to receive, administer, spend,  invest and dispose of gifts. Gifts to the agency from individuals or  organizations can be a useful adjunct to appropriated funds and may  enhance the agency's ability to fulfill its mission, as well as further  mutually beneficial public/private partnerships, or other useful  arrangements or relationships. Such uses of this authority are  appropriate provided that solicitation or acceptance of a gift does not  compromise the integrity of OGE, its programs or employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of gifts. Gifts to OGE may be used to carry out any activity  that furthers the mission, programs, responsibilities, functions or  activities of the agency. Gifts may be used to carry out program  functions whether or not appropriated funds are available for that  purpose, provided that such expenditures are not barred by law or  regulation. Gifts may also be used for official travel by employees to  events or activities required to carry out the agency's statutory or  regulatory functions. Gifts to the agency may also be used for the  travel expenses of spouses accompanying employees on official travel, if  such travel could be paid for by appropriated funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sources. Generally, gifts may be solicited or accepted from any  source, including a prohibited source, provided that the standards of  this part are met. Gifts generally should be made directly to the agency  and not through intermediaries. However, where a gift is offered by an  intermediary, both the intermediary and the ultimate source of the gift  should be analyzed to determine whether acceptance would be appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Endorsement. Acceptance of a gift pursuant to this part shall  not in any way be deemed to be an endorsement of the donor, or the  donor's products, services, activities, or policies. Letters to a donor  expressing appreciation of a gift are permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Type of gift. The agency may solicit or accept any gift that is  within its statutory authority. However, as a matter of policy, OGE will  not solicit or accept gifts of currency pursuant to this part. Donors  who offer currency should be advised that the gift may be made by check  or money order payable to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.</p>
