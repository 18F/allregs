                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term corn sirup means a clarified, concentrated aqueous  solution of the products obtained by the incomplete hydrolysis of  cornstarch, and includes dried corn sirup. The solids of corn sirup and  of dried corn sirup contain not less than 40 percent by weight of  reducing sugars calculated as anhydrous dextrose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term dextrose means the hydrated or anhydrous, refined  monosaccharide obtained from hydrolyzed starch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term dried glucose sirup means the product obtained by  drying ``glucose sirup.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term glucose sirup means a clarified, concentrated, aqueous  solution of the products obtained by the incomplete hydrolysis of any  edible starch. The solids of glucose sirup contain not less than 40  percent by weight of reducing sugars calculated as anhydrous dextrose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The term invert sugar sirup means an aqueous solution of  inverted or partly inverted, refined or partly refined sucrose, the  solids of which contain not more than 0.3 percent by weight of ash, and  which is colorless, odorless, and flavorless, except for sweetness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The term sugar means refined sucrose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The terms edible organic acid and edible organic salt refer to  any edible organic acid and any edible organic salt added for the  purpose of flavor enhancement that either is not a food additive as  defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  or, if it is a food additive as so defined, is used in conformity with  regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The term water means, in addition to water, any mixture of water  and fruit juice in which the fruit juice(s) is less than 50 percent of  such mixture, including any water contributed by the use of liquid  nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The term fruit juice(s) and water means any mixture of fruit  juice as herein defined and water, including any water contributed by  the use of liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, in which the fruit  juice(s) is 50 percent, or more, of such mixture except that water used  in preparing equivalent single strength juice(s) from concentrate(s)  shall not be considered to be a mixture of fruit juice and water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The term fruit juice(s) means single strength expressed juice(s)  of sound, mature fruit(s). It may be fresh, frozen, canned, or made from  concentrate(s). However, if it is made from concentrate(s), the juice(s)  shall be reconstituted with water to not less than   the soluble solids that such fruit juice had before concentration. Fruit  juice(s) may be used singly or in combination. If a fruit juice(s) is  used which is regulated by a standard of identity of this chapter, it  shall conform to the compositional requirements prescribed by such  standard prior to the addition of any sweetener which may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The term clarified juice means the liquid expressed wholly or in  part from fruit peelings, fruit shells, fruit cores, or from the fruit  flesh or parts thereof, which is clarified and may be further refined or  concentrated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The term solid pack means the product contains practically all  fruit with only the very little free flowing liquid that is expressed  from the fruit and to which no packing media have been added.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The procedure for determining the densities of the packing media  means the following: The density of the packing medium, when measured 15  days or more after packing, or the density of the blended homogenized  slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container, when measured  less than 15 days after canning, is determined according to ``Official  Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical  Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference, section  31.\6\F011 (Solids) ``By Means of the Refractometer--Official Final  Action'' (and sections 52.012 and 52.015) with result expressed as  percent by weight of sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for  temperature to the equivalent at 20 C, but without correction for  invert sugar or other substances. Copies of the material incorporated by  reference may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North  Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information  on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go  to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The procedure for determining drained weight is as follows: Tilt  the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the  meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The  diameter of the sieve is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of  contents of the container is less than 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 30.5  centimeters (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or  more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth which complies with  the specifications for the No. 8 sieve set forth in the ``Definitions of  Terms and Explanatory Notes'' of the ``Official Methods of Analysis of  the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980),  which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this  incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (m) of this section.  Carefully invert by hand all fruits having cups or cavities if they fall  on the sieve with cups or cavities up. Cups or cavities in soft products  may be drained by tilting sieve. Without further shifting the material  on the sieve, incline the sieve at an angle of 17 to 20 to facilitate  drainage. Two minutes after the drainage begins, weigh the sieve and  drained fruit. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall  be considered to be the weight of the drained fruit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Compliance means the following: Unless otherwise provided in a  standard, a lot of canned fruits shall be deemed in compliance for the  following factors, to be determined by the sampling and acceptance  procedure as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, namely:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Packing medium density. A lot shall be deemed to be in  compliance for packing medium density based on the average sucrose value  for all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans, but no  container may have a sucrose value lower than that of the next lower  category or 2 percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) lower if no lower  category exists.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quality. The quality of a lot shall be considered acceptable  when the number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number in  the sampling plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fill of container. A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for  fill of container (packing medium and fruit ingredient) when the number  of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number (c) in the sampling  plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Drained weight. A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for  drained weight based on the average value of all samples analyzed  according to the sampling plans. The sample unit shall be the entire  contents of the container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The sampling and acceptance procedure means the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lot. A collection of primary containers or  units of the same size, type, and style manufactured or packed under  similar conditions and handled as a single unit of trade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lot size. The number of primary containers or units in the lot.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sample size. The total number of sample units drawn for  examination from a lot.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sample unit. A container, a portion of the contents of a  container, or a composite mixture of product from small containers that  is sufficient for the examination or testing as a single unit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Defective. Any sample unit shall be regarded as defective when  the sample unit does not meet the criteria set forth in the standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Acceptance number (c). The maximum number of defective sample  units permitted in the sample in order to consider the lot as meeting  the specified requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Acceptable quality level (AQL). The maximum percent of  defective sample units permitted in a lot that will be accepted  approximately 95 percent of the time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sampling plans:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Size in container</p><p class="depth3">Lot size (primary containers)           ---------------------</p><p class="depth3">n \1\      c \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">net weight equal to or less than 1 kg (2.2 lb) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4,800 or less.....................................         13          2 4,801 to 24,000...................................         21          3 24,001 to 48,000..................................         29          4 48,001 to 84,000..................................         48          6 84,001 to 144,000.................................         84          9 144,001 to 240,000................................        126         13 Over 240,000......................................        200         19 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">net weight greater than 1 kg (2.2 lb) but not more than 4.5 kg (10 lb) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2,400 or less.....................................         13          2 2,401 to 15,000...................................         21          3 15,001 to 24,000..................................         29          4 24,001 to 42,000..................................         48          6 42,001 to 72,000..................................         84          9 72,001 to 120,000.................................        126         13 Over 120,000......................................        200         19 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">net weight greater than 4.5 kg (10 lb) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 600 or less.......................................         13          2 601 to 2,000......................................         21          3 2,001 to 7,200....................................         29          4 7,201 to 15,000...................................         48          6 15,001 to 24,000..................................         84          9 24,001 to 42,000..................................        126         13 Over 42,000.......................................        200         19 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ n=number of primary containers in sample. \2\ c=acceptance number.
