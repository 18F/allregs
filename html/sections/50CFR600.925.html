For Federal actions, EFH Conservation Recommendations will be provided to Federal agencies as part of EFH consultations conducted pursuant to Sec. 600.920. If NMFS becomes aware of a Federal action that would adversely affect EFH, but for which a Federal agency has not initiated an EFH consultation, NMFS may request that the Federal agency initiate EFH consultation, or NMFS will provide EFH Conservation Recommendations based on the information available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recommendations to state agencies--(1) Establishment of procedures. The Magnuson-Stevens Act does not require state agencies to consult with the Secretary regarding EFH.
