                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Every semiportable fire extinguisher shall conform to  the requirements for listing and labeling by a recognized laboratory and  shall be of such design, materials, and construction as to meet the  requirements specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Design. Every semiportable extinguisher shall be fitted with  hose of sufficient length to a nozzle or nozzles to provide for suitable  application of the extinguishing agent to any part of the space  protected (a length of pipe may connect the outlet of the supply to the  hose connection); shall weigh more than 55 pounds when fully charged;  shall be self-contained, i.e., when   charged, it shall not require any additional source of extinguishing  agent or expellant energy for its operation; and shall provide simple  means for immediate operation by a single operator. The design,  materials and construction shall provide reliability of operation and  performance after non-use for long periods under conditions encountered  in marine service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Materials. Materials used for exposed working parts, except  those used for inversion mechanism or similar purposes, shall be  corrosion-resistant to salt water and spray. Materials used for other  exposed parts shall be either corrosion-resistant or shall be protected  by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Corrosion-resistant materials. The materials which are  considered to be corrosion-resistant are copper, brass, bronze, certain  copper-nickel alloys, certain alloys of aluminum, certain plastics, and  certain stainless steels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corrosion-resistant coatings. (i) The following systems of  organic or metallic coatings for exposed nonworking ferrous parts except  for ICC cylinders, when applied on properly prepared surfaces after all  cutting, forming, and bending operations are completed, are considered  to provide suitable corrosion resistance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Bonderizing, followed by the application of zinc chromate  primer, followed by one or more applications of enamel; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Inorganic zinc coatings; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Hot-dipped or electrodeposited zinc in thicknesses not less than  0.002 inch; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Electrodeposited Cadmium in thicknesses not less than 0.001  inch; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Hot-dipped or sprayed aluminum in thicknesses not less than  0.002 inch; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Copper plus nickel in total thicknesses not less than 0.003  inch, or which the nickel is not less than 0.002 inch, plus any  thickness of chrome.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The metallic platings of less than the thicknesses specified in  this paragraph are not acceptable for the protection against corrosion  of ferrous parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decorative platings. Decorative platings in any thicknesses  applied over corrosion-resistant materials and corrosion-resistant  coatings are acceptable for either working or nonworking parts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dissimilar metals. The use of dissimilar metals in combination  shall be avoided wherever possible, but when such contacts are  necessary, provisions (such as bushings, gaskets, or o-rings) shall be  employed to prevent such deleterious effects as galvanic corrosion,  freezing or buckling of parts, and loosening or tightening of joints due  to differences in thermal expansion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Suitability of materials. In event of question as to the  suitability of the materials (including coatings) used, the salt spray  test described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section shall be conducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Salt spray test. Expose either component parts, subassemblies,  or the complete fully charged specimen extinguisher to a 20 percent  sodium-chloride solution spray at a temperature of 95 [deg]F. (35  [deg]C.) for a period of 240 hours. The procedures and apparatus  described in Method 811 of Federal Test Method Standard No. 151 are  suitable. Alternate methods may be found satisfactory if the results are  comparable. Following the test, allow the specimen extinguisher to air  dry for a period of 48 hours. Following the air drying, the specimen  extinguisher shall be capable of being operated satisfactorily without  undue effort or special procedures on the part of the operator, and it  shall be capable of being recharged satisfactorily in accordance with  the directions on the nameplate without the use of extraordinary tools  or procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Gauges. Every pressure gauge used on a semiportable fire  extinguisher shall have an accuracy of at least 2 percent of the scale  range for the middle half of the scale conforming to ASME Grade B  commercial accuracy. The gauge when new shall be watertight, i.e., with  the connection capped or plugged, no water shall penetrate to the  interior of the case during submergence 1 foot below the surface of  water for a period of 2 hours. The gauge shall be constructed of  corrosion-resistant materials, so that the pointer or face lettering  will not be obliterated by the action of salt water if some leakage  should occur after rough handling or extended periods of service. The  gage,   when attached to the extinguisher, shall pass the salt spray and  vibration tests prescribed by paragraphs (c)(6) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Vibration resistance. Either component parts, subassemblies, or  the complete, fully charged specimen extinguisher, shall be tested in  accordance with sections 3.1 through 3.1.4.4 of Military Standard MIL- STD-167. Following this test, there shall be no obvious failures of  parts or assemblies, and they shall be capable of being operated  satisfactorily without undue effort or special procedures on the part of  the operator, and the extinguisher shall be capable of being recharged  satisfactorily in accordance with the directions on the name plate  without the use of extraordinary tools or procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Carbon dioxide type. Every carbon dioxide type extinguisher  shall be fitted with a valve which will withstand a minimum bursting  pressure of 6,000 p.s.i., and a discharge hose or tube which will  withstand a minimum bursting pressure of 5,000 p.s.i. The hose shall be  constructed with either a wire braid or other conducting material for  conducting static charges occurring at the discharge nozzle back to the  body of the extinguisher.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Chemical-foam type. Every chemical foam type semiportable fire  extinguisher shall have a nozzle which will provide operating  characteristics such that when it is held about 3 feet above the ground  at an elevation of approximately 30[deg], and with the extinguisher and  contents both at approximately 70 [deg]F. and 120 [deg]F., the range of  the stream shall not exceed 40 feet, and the major portion of the  discharge shall fall between 20 and 40 feet, measured horizontally, from  the nozzle. The duration of the effective discharge shall be between 2.5  and 4.0 minutes, effective discharge being considered as occurring while  the major portion of the discharge falls beyond 10 feet, measured  horizontally, from the nozzle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Toxic extinguishing agents. Every semiportable fire extinguisher  shall contain only agents which qualify for the Underwriters'  Laboratories, Inc., toxicity rating of Group 5 or Group 6, and which in  normal fire extinguishing use do not generate decomposition products in  concentrations hazardous to life. Acceptance of extinguishing agents  under these requirements will be determined by the Coast Guard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Fire tests. Fire tests may be employed in determining the  suitability for ``marine type'' listing and labeling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Additional tests. Every semiportable extinguisher may be  additionally examined and tested to establish its reliability and  effectiveness in accordance with the intent of this specification for a  ``marine type'' semiportable fire extinguisher when considered necessary  by the Coast Guard or by the recognized laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Additional marking. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As part of the usual nameplate marking,  there shall be included the rated capacity of the extinguisher in  gallons, quarts, or pounds, and complete instructions for recharging,  including the identification of the recharge materials and of the  pressure containing cylinder or separate container if one is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pasted-on type paper or decalcomania labels are not acceptable  for any of the required extinguisher marking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recharge packages shall be legibly marked with the name of the  recharge and the capacity of contents in gallons, quarts, or pounds in  addition to the usual recharge package marking. Recharge pressure  containing cylinders shall, in addition to the usual marking, also be  plainly marked to show the distinctive identifying designation of the  cylinder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Securing means. Every semi-portable fire extinguisher shall be  supplied with a suitable means for holding the extinguisher securely in  its stowage location on vessels or boats. The materials shall be  sufficiently corrosion-resistant or protected against corrosion to  withstand the test prescribed by paragraph (c)(6) of this section  without showing more than traces of slight corrosion, which may be  easily wiped off after rinsing with tapwater.
