                            <p class="depth0">This subpart establishes oil spill response plan requirements for  all marine transportation-related (MTR) facilities (hereafter also  referred to as facilities) that could reasonably be expected to cause  substantial harm or significant and substantial harm to the environment  by discharing oil into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines,  or exclusive economic zone. The development of a response plan prepares  the facility owner or operator to respond to an oil spill. These  requirements specify criteria to be used during the planning process to  determine the appropriate response resources. The specific criteria for  response resources and their arrival times are not performance  standards. The criteria are based on a set of assumptions that may not  exist during an actual oil spill incident.</p>
