                                Sec. 1.483-3  Test rate of interest applicable to a contract.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. For purposes of section 483, the test rate of  interest for a contract is the same as the test rate that would apply  under Sec. 1.1274-4 if the contract were a debt instrument. Paragraph  (b) of this section, however, provides for a lower test rate in the case  of certain sales or exchanges of land between related individuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lower rate for certain sales or exchanges of land between  related individuals--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test rate. In the case of a qualified sale or  exchange of land between related individuals (described in section  483(e)), the test rate is not greater than 6 percent, compounded  semiannually, or an equivalent rate based on an appropriate compounding  period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rules. The following rules and definitions apply in  determining whether a sale or exchange is a qualified sale under section  483(e):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Definition of family members. The members of an individual's  family are determined as of the date of the sale or exchange. The  members of an individual's family include those individuals described in  section 267(c)(4) and the spouses of those individuals. In addition, for  purposes of section 267(c)(4), full effect is given to a legal adoption,  ancestor means parents and grandparents, and lineal descendants means  children and grandchildren.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $500,000 limitation. Section 483(e) does not apply to the  extent that the stated principal amount of the debt instrument issued in  the sale or exchange, when added to the aggregate stated principal  amount of any other debt instruments to which section 483(e) applies  that were issued in prior qualified sales between the same two  individuals during the same calendar year, exceeds $500,000. See Example  3 of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other limitations. Section 483(e) does not apply if the  parties to a contract include persons other than the related individuals  and the parties enter into the contract with an intent to circumvent the  purposes of section 483(e). In addition, if the property sold or  exchanged includes any property other than land, section 483(e) applies  only to the extent that the stated principal amount of the debt  instrument issued in the sale or exchange is attributable to the land  (based on the relative fair market values of the land and the other  property).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this  paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. On January 1, 1995, A sells land to B, A's child, for  $650,000. The contract for sale calls for B to make a $250,000 down  payment and issue a debt instrument with a stated principal amount of  $400,000. Because the stated principal amount of the debt instrument is  less than $500,000, the sale is a qualified sale and section 483(e)  applies to the debt instrument.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 of paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, except that on June 1, 1995, A sells additional   land to B under a contract that calls for B to issue a debt instrument  with a stated principal amount of $100,000. The stated principal amount  of this debt instrument ($100,000) when added to the stated principal  amount of the prior debt instrument ($400,000) does not exceed $500,000.  Thus, section 483(e) applies to both debt instruments.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1 of paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, except that on June 1, 1995, A sells additional  land to B under a contract that calls for B to issue a debt instrument  with a stated principal amount of $150,000. The stated principal amount  of this debt instrument when added to the stated principal amount of the  prior debt instrument ($400,000) exceeds $500,000. Thus, for purposes of  section 483(e), the debt instrument issued in the sale of June 1, 1995,  is treated as two separate debt instruments: a $100,000 debt instrument  (to which section 483(e) applies) and a $50,000 debt instrument (to  which section 1274, if otherwise applicable, applies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. This section applies to sales and exchanges that  occur on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this  section for sales and exchanges that occur after December 21, 1992, and  before April 4, 1994.  [T.D. 8517, 59 FR 4807, Feb. 2, 1994]</p>
