Sec. 63.2455 through 63.2470, you may comply with the emission limits in paragraph (a) of this section and demonstrate compliance in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Emission limits and work practice standards.

streams through a closed-vent system to a control device that reduces HAP emissions as specified in either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must route vent

streams through a closed-vent system to a control device that reduces HAP emissions as specified in either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you use a combustion control device, it must reduce HAP emissions as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To an outlet TOC concentration of 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To an outlet concentration of hydrogen halide and halogen HAP of 20 ppmv or less.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> As an alternative to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, if you control halogenated vent streams emitted from a combustion device followed by a scrubber, reduce the hydrogen halide and halogen HAP generated in the combustion device by greater than or equal to 95 percent by weight in the scrubber.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you use a noncombustion control device(s), it must reduce HAP emissions to an outlet total organic HAP concentration of 50 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of hydrogen halide and halogen HAP of 50 ppmv or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Group 1 process vents within a process that are not controlled according to this alternative standard must be controlled according to the emission limits in tables 1 through 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance requirements. To demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.1258(b)(5) beginning no later than the initial compliance date specified in Sec. 63.2445, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must comply with the requirements in Sec. 63.983 and the requirements referenced therein for closed-vent systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When Sec. 63.1258(b)(5)(i) refers to Sec.
