                            <p class="depth0">The Academy will charge room and board to all persons staying at the Academy, except MSHA personnel, persons attending the Academy under a program supported through an MSHA State grant, and persons performing a direct service. Also, subject to available resources, MSHA may waive all or part of fees for students, or persons employed by a non-profit organization, who are invited by MSHA to attend an MSHA-sponsored training or meeting which would, in the Agency's judgment, contribute to improved conduct, supervision, or management of a function or activity under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 or a function related to an MSHA appropriation. Requests for waivers must be in writing. Charges for room and board will be based upon the average cost per person of the lodging, meals, and services provided and will be reassessed on an annual basis.
