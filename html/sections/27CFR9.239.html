For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Creston District'' is a term of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The five United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 scale topographic maps used to determine the boundary of the Creston District viticultural area are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Creston, Calif., 1948, photorevised 1980;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shedd Canyon, Calif., 1961;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wilson Corner, CA, 1995;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Camatta Ranch, CA, 1995; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Santa Margarita, Calif., 1965, revised 1993.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary.
