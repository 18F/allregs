                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice. When SBA determines that an individual minimum capital  requirement above that set forth in this subpart or other legal  authority is necessary or appropriate for a particular SBLC, SBA will  notify the SBLC in writing of the proposed individual minimum capital  requirement, the date by which it should be reached and will   provide an explanation of why the requirement proposed is considered  necessary or appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SBLC response. The SBLC may respond to the notice. The response  should include any matters which the SBLC would have SBA consider in  deciding whether individual minimum capital requirements should be  established for the SBLC, what those capital requirements should be,  and, if applicable, when they should be achieved. The response must be  in writing and delivered to the AA/CA within 30 days after the date on  which the SBLC received the notice. SBA may shorten the time for  response when, in the opinion of SBA, the condition of the SBLC so  warrants, provided that the SBLC is informed promptly of the new time  period, or the SBLC consents to the shortening of its response time. In  its discretion, SBA may extend the time period for good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to respond. An SBLC that does not respond within 30 days  or such other time period as may be specified by SBA will have waived  any objections to the proposed minimum capital requirement and the  deadline for its achievement. Failure to respond will also constitute  consent to the individual minimum capital requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decision. After the close of the SBLC's response period, the AA/ CA will decide, based on a review of SBA reasons for proposing the  individual minimum capital requirement, the SBLC's response, and other  information concerning the SBLC, whether the individual minimum capital  requirement should be established for the SBLC and, if so, the  requirement and the date it will become effective. The SBLC will be  notified of the decision in writing. The notice will include an  explanation of the decision; except for a decision not to establish an  individual minimum capital requirement for the SBLC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Submission of plan. The decision may require the SBLC to develop  and submit to SBA, within a time period specified, an acceptable plan to  reach the individual minimum capital requirement by the date required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Change in circumstances. If, after SBA's decision in paragraph  (d) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances affecting  the SBLC's capital adequacy or its ability to reach the required  individual minimum capital requirement by the specified date, either the  SBLC or the AA/CA may propose to the other a change in the individual  minimum capital requirement for the SBLC, the date when the individual  minimum must be achieved, and/or the SBLC's plan (if applicable). The  AA/CA may decline to consider proposals that are not based on a  significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous.  Pending a decision by the AA/CA on reconsideration, SBA's original  decision and any plan required under that decision will continue in full  force and effect.  [73 FR 75516, Dec. 11, 2008]</p>
