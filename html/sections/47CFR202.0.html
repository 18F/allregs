                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During, or in anticipation of, a non-wartime emergency or  natural disaster, a telecommunications capacity must exist to provide  temporary telecommunications service to State and local government  officials and other persons deemed appropriate by the President.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event of a general war and attack upon the Nation, a  national telecommunications capability must exist that will support  telecommunications requirements with respect to national security,  survival and recovery. The development of survivable telecommunications  to support essential functions (including an emergency broadcasting  system), and technical compatibility of signaling methods, transmission  modes, switching facilities, and terminal devices to permit exchange of  communications over the surviving media of all systems, government or  commercial, are crucial elements of such a national capability. In  addition, a survivable national telecommunications management structure  is necessary to manage initiation, coordination and restoration of  telecommunications services. The management structure must include the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legal authority for telecommunications management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A control mechanism to manage the initiation, coordination and  restoration of telecommunications services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures to ensure timely damage assessment and allocation of  residual resources and controlled restoration of services based on  national policy/direction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The capability to execute a telecommunications recovery plan  based on national policy/guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding any provision regarding NS/EP Planning and  Execution, nothing in this part shall be deemed to affect the  authorities or responsibilities of the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, or any Office or official thereof; or reassign  any function assigned any agency under the Federal Property and  Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, or under any other law,  or any function vested by law in the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
