The Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, prescribes the application of the advertising requirements of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes to the acquisition of Indian supplies. As specified in 25 U.S.C. 47, the Buy Indian Act provides that, so far as may be practicable, Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) of Indian industry may be made in open market in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Due to the transfer of authority from the Department of the Interior to HHS, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to use the Buy Indian Act in the acquisition of products of Indian industry, in connection with the maintenance and operation of hospital and health facilities for Indians, and for the conservation of the health of Indians. This authority has been delegated exclusively to IHS and is not available for use by any other HHS component (unless that component is making an acquisition on behalf of IHS). However, the Buy Indian Act itself does not exempt IHS from meeting the statutorily mandated small business goals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subsequent legislation, particularly Public Law 94-437 and Public Law 96-537, have emphasized the use of the Buy Indian Act negotiation authority.</p>
