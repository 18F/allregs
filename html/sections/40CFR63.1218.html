You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation:

If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec.  261.31 of this chapter), you must achieve a DRE of 99.9999% for each POHC that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC.
