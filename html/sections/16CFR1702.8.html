                            <p class="depth0">Human experience data constitutes the primary criterion used by the  Commission in evaluating petitions for exemptions. Petitions shall  therefore include a compilation of all reasonably available reports  pertaining to human use of the particular substance, including the  product brand as well as generic equivalents and involving adverse  reports of personal injury, illness, and significant allergenicity. Such  information in children is of particular importance in evaluating  exemption requests. However, similar data in adults shall also be  submitted if available. Human experience data may be obtained from such  sources as:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reports from Poison Control Centers,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reports of adverse reactions relative to the product that have  been submitted to the company by physicians, hospitals, consumers, and  other sources,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extensive searches of the medical, pharmacological, and  toxicological literature, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For drugs, where the human experience data submitted is based on  data required by FDA to be compiled for an Investigational Exemption for  a New Drug (IND), 21 CFR part 312, or a New Drug Application (NDA), 21  CFR part 314, a summary of the relevant data should be provided. The  entire NDA and IND material need not be submitted.</p>
