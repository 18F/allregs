                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules.(1) Application for subpoena. As provided under this part, any party may apply to the presiding officer for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must contain the proposed document subpoena, and a brief statement of facts demonstrating that the documents are materially relevant to the charges and issues presented in the proceeding and the reasonableness of the scope of the document request. The subpoenaing party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for production in response to the subpoena, and state its unequivocal intention to pay for the production of the documents as provided in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application for subpoena. As provided under this part, any party may apply to the presiding officer for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must contain the proposed document subpoena, and a brief statement of facts demonstrating that the documents are materially relevant to the charges and issues presented in the proceeding and the reasonableness of the scope of the document request. The subpoenaing party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for production in response to the subpoena, and state its unequivocal intention to pay for the production of the documents as provided in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service of subpoena. A party shall apply for a document subpoena under this section only within the time period during which such party could serve a discovery request under Sec. 1209.30 of this part. The party obtaining the document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the subpoenaed person and for serving copies on all other parties. Document subpoenas may be served in the District of Columbia, or

any State, Territory, possession, or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or as otherwise provided by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Presiding officer's discretion. The presiding officer shall issue promptly any document subpoena applied for under this section subject to the application conditions set forth in this section and his or her discretion. If the presiding officer determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the requested document subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or otherwise objectionable under Sec. 1209.29(b), he may refuse to issue the requested document subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon such additional conditions as may be determined by the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Motion to quash or modify.(1) Limited appearance. Any non-party to a pending proceeding to whom a document subpoena is directed may enter a limited appearance, through a representative or on his or her own behalf, before the presiding officer to file with the presiding officer a motion to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limited appearance. Any non-party to a pending proceeding to whom a document subpoena is directed may enter a limited appearance, through a representative or on his or her own behalf, before the presiding officer to file with the presiding officer a motion to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objections. Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed on the same basis, including the assertion of any privileges, upon which a party could object to a discovery document request under Sec. 1209.30 and during the same time limits during which such an objection could be filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Responses and replies. The party who obtained the subpoena may respond to such motion within 10 days of service of the motion; the response shall be served on the non-party in accordance with this part. Absent express leave of the presiding officer, no other party may respond to the non-party's motion. The non-party may file a reply within five days of service of a response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No stay. A non-party's right to seek to quash or modify a document subpoena shall not stay the proceeding, or limit in any manner the sanctions that may be imposed by the presiding officer against a party who induces another to fail to produce any such subpoenaed documents. No party may rely upon the pendency of a non-party's motion to quash or modify a document subpoena to excuse performance of any action required of that party under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enforcing document subpoenas to non-parties.(1) Application for enforcement of subpoena. If a non-party fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or with any order of the presiding officer that directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena issued pursuant to this section, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party to the proceeding may, to the extent authorized by section 1379D(c) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4641(c)), apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Application for enforcement of subpoena. If a non-party fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or with any order of the presiding officer that directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena issued pursuant to this section, the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved party to the proceeding may, to the extent authorized by section 1379D(c) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4641(c)), apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No stay. A party's right to seek district court enforcement of a non-party document production subpoena under this section shall not automatically stay an enforcement proceeding under of the Safety and Soundness Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sanctions. A party's right to seek district court enforcement of a non-party document subpoena shall in no way limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the presiding officer on a party who induces another to fail to comply with any subpoena issued under this section.</p>
