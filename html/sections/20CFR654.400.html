                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart sets forth the Employment and Training Administration standards for agricultural housing. Local Job Service offices, as part of the State employment service agencies and in cooperation with the United States Employment Service, assist employers in recruiting agricultural workers from places outside the area of intended employment. The experiences of the employment service indicate that employees so referred have on many occasions been provided with inadequate, unsafe, and unsanitary housing conditions. To discourage this practice, it is the policy of the Federal-State employment service system, as set forth in Sec. 653.108 of this chapter, to deny its intrastate and interstate recruitment services to employers until the State employment service agency has ascertained that the employer's housing meets certain standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To implement this policy, Sec. 653.108 of this chapter provides that recruitment services shall be denied unless the employer has signed an assurance, a preoccupancy inspection has been conducted and the ES staff has ascertained that, with respect to intrastate clearance, if the workers are to be housed, the employer's housing meets or, with respect to interstate clearance, that the employer will provide housing for the workers which meets either the full set of standards set forth at 29 CFR 1910.142 or the full set of standards set forth in this subpart. Whichever is applicable under the criteria set forth in Sec. 654.401; except that for mobile range housing for sheepherders, the housing shall meet existing Departmental guidelines.
