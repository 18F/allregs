Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Harvest. The removal of mature almonds from the orchard.</p><p class="depth0">Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any  form of alternating or mixed pattern.</p><p class="depth0">Meat pounds. The total pounds of almond meats (whole, chipped and  broken, and in-shell meats). In-shell almonds will be converted to meat  pounds in accordance with FCIC approved procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Production guarantee (per acre). The quantity of almonds (total meat  pounds per acre) determined by multiplying the approved actual  production history (APH) yield per acre by the coverage level percentage  you elect.</p><p class="depth0">Set out. Transplanting the tree into the orchard.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unit Division</p><p class="depth0">Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by  section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated  and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be  established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous  land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining</p><p class="depth0">Indemnities</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions  (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> You may select only one price election for all the almonds in  the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions  provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select  one price election for each almond type designated in the Special  Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the  same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each  type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price  election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum  price election for all other types.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You must report, by the production reporting date designated in  section 3 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by type if applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other  circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon  which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected  acres;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable  acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The age of the trees and the planting patterns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with  another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage  is changed, the age of the crop that is interplanted with the almonds,  and type if applicable, and the planting pattern; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any other information that we request in order to establish your  approved yield.</p><p class="depth0">We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee  as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following:  interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in  practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the  insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may  reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production  guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or  the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a  cause of loss that would or could reduce the yield of the insured crop  has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.</p><p class="depth0">4. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8),  the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.</p><p class="depth0">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8),  the cancellation and termination dates are December 31.</p><p class="depth0">6. Insured Crop</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8),  the crop insured will be all the almonds in the county for which a  premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In which you have a share unless allowed otherwise by section  8(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> That are grown for harvest as almonds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> That are irrigated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered  acceptable to us; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> On acreage where at least 90 percent of the trees have reached  at least the sixth growing season after being set out, unless otherwise  provided in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">7. Insurable Acreage</p><p class="depth0">In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions  (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with  another crop, almonds interplanted with another perennial crop are  insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not  meet the requirements contained in your policy.</p><p class="depth0">8. Insurance Period</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic  Provisions (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Coverage begins on January 1 of each crop year, except that for  the year of application, if your application is received after December  21, but prior to January 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after  your properly completed application is received in our local office  unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine  that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any  information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition  of the orchard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each  crop year is November 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each  subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force,  coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the  insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that  results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a  subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous  coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If your almond policy is canceled or terminated for any crop  year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance  attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and  termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered  to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee,  or indemnity will be due for such crop year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period)  of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after  coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop  year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable,  insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the  calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage  acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage  of almonds on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year,  insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or  indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar  form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such  transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.</p><p class="depth0">9. Causes of Loss</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic  Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against the  following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adverse weather conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or  pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper  application of pest control measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper  application of disease control measures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Earthquake;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Volcanic eruption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured  peril that occurs during the insurance period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes  of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure  against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the  almonds for any reason other than actual physical damage to the almonds  from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will  not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine,  boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.</p><p class="depth0">10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic  Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if you intend to claim an indemnity on any  unit, you must notify us prior to the beginning of harvest so that we  may inspect the damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the  damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If  you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production  will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.</p><p class="depth0">11. Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you  are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for  which such production records were not provided; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production  to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage  for the units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will  settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production  guarantee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective  price election for the type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if  applicable, (see subsection 11(c)) by the respective price election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in  section 11(b)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.</p><p class="depth0">For example:</p><p class="depth0">You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of almonds in the unit,  with a guarantee of 1,200 pounds per acre and a price election of $1.70  per pound. You are only able to harvest 100,000 pounds. Your indemnity  would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 100 acres x 1,200 pounds = 120,000 pound insurance guarantee;</p><p class="depth0">(2 & 3) 120,000 pounds x $1.70 price election = $204,000 total value  of insurance guarantee;</p><p class="depth0">(4 & 5) 100,000 pounds production to count x $1.70 price election =  $170,000 total value of production to count;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> $204,000 total of value guarantee--$170,000 total value of  production to count = $34,000 loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> $34,000 x 100 percent share = $34,000 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The total production to count, specified in meat pounds, from  all insurable acreage on the unit will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All appraised production as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That is abandoned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Production lost due to uninsured causes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unharvested production; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to  abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised  amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that  acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer  the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will  then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that  harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which  case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to  care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will  be used to determine the production to count; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested meat pounds, including meat pounds damaged due to  uninsured causes of loss.</p><p class="depth0">12. Late and Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0">The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions  are not applicable.
