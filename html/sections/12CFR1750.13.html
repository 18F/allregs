                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Risk-Based Capital Test--OFHEO shall compute a risk-based capital level for each Enterprise at least quarterly by applying the risk-based capital test described in appendix A to this subpart to determine the amount of total capital required for each Enterprise to maintain positive capital during the stress period. In making this determination, the Director shall take into account any appropriate distinctions among types of mortgage products, differences in seasoning of mortgages, and other factors determined appropriate by the Director in accordance with the methodology specified in appendix A to this subpart. The stress period has the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credit risk--With respect to mortgages owned or guaranteed by the Enterprise and other obligations of the Enterprise, losses occur throughout the United States at a rate of default and severity reasonably related, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart, to the benchmark loss experience.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest rate risk--(i) In general. Interest rates decrease as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section or increase as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, whichever would require more capital in the stress test for the Enterprise. Appendix A to this subpart contains a description of the methodology applied to implement the interest rate scenarios described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Interest rates decrease as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section or increase as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, whichever would require more capital in the stress test for the Enterprise. Appendix A to this subpart contains a description of the methodology applied to implement the interest rate scenarios described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Decreases. The 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield decreases during the first year of the stress period and remains at the new level for the remainder of the stress period. The yield decreases to the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 600 basis points below the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 60 percent of the average yield during the 3 years immediately preceding the stress period, but in no case to a yield less than 50 percent of the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increases. The 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield increases during the first year of the stress period and will remain at the new level for the

remainder of the stress period. The yield increases to the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 600 basis points above the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> 160 percent of the average yield during the 3 years immediately preceding the stress period, but in no case to a yield greater than 175 percent of the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Different terms to maturity. Yields of Treasury instruments with terms to maturity other than 10 years will change relative to the 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield in patterns and for durations that are reasonably related to historical experience and are judged reasonable by the Director. The methodology used by the Director to adjust the yields of those other instruments is specified in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Large increases in yields. If the 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield is assumed to increase by more than 50 percent over the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period, the Director shall adjust the losses resulting from the conditions specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section to reflect a correspondingly higher rate of general price inflation. The method of such adjustment by the Director is specified in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> New business. Any contractual commitments of the Enterprise to purchase mortgages or issue securities will be fulfilled. The characteristics of resulting mortgages purchased, securities issued, and other financing will be consistent with the contractual terms of such commitments, recent experience, and the economic characteristics of the stress period, as more fully specified in appendix A to this subpart. No other purchases of mortgages shall be assumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other activities. Losses or gains on other activities, including interest rate and foreign exchange hedging activities, shall be determined by the Director, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart and on the basis of available information, to be consistent with the stress period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Consistency. Characteristics of the stress period other than those specifically set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, such as prepayment experience and dividend policies, will be determined by the Director, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart, on the basis of available information, to be most consistent with the stress period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Risk-Based Capital Level. The risk-based capital level of an Enterprise, to be used in determining the appropriate capital classification of each Enterprise, as required by section 1364 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4614), shall be equal to the sum of the following amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Credit and Interest Rate Risk. The amount of total capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under paragraph (a) of this section to the Enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Management and Operations Risk. To provide for management and operations risk, 30 percent of the amount of total capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under paragraph (a) of this section to the Enterprise.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

class="depth0">OFHEO will use the definitions, data, and methodology described below to identify the Benchmark Loss Experience.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">The terms defined in the Glossary to this appendix shall apply for this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Data</p><p class="depth0">[a] OFHEO identifies the Benchmark Loss Experience (BLE) using historical loan-level data required to be submitted by each of the two Enterprises. OFHEO's analysis is based entirely on the data available through 1995 on conventional, 30-year, fixed-rate loans secured by first liens on single-unit, owner-occupied, detached properties. For this purpose, detached properties are defined as single family properties excluding condominiums, planned urban developments, and cooperatives. The data includes only loans that were purchased by an Enterprise within 12 months after loan origination and loans for which the Enterprise has no recourse to the lender.</p><p class="depth0">[b] OFHEO organizes the data from each Enterprise to create two substantially consistent data sets. OFHEO separately analyzes default and severity data from each Enterprise. Default rates are calculated from loan records meeting the criteria specified above. Severity rates are calculated from the subset of defaulted loans for which loss data are available.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Procedures</p><p class="depth0">[a] Cumulative ten-year default rates for each combination of states and origination years (state/year combination) that OFHEO examines are calculated for each Enterprise by grouping all of the Enterprise's loans originated in that combination of states and years. For origination years with less than ten-years of loss experience, cumulative-to-date default rates are used. The two Enterprise default rates are averaged, yielding an ``average default rate'' for that state/year combination.</p><p class="depth0">[b] An ``average severity rate'' for each state/year combination is determined in the same manner as the average default rate. For each Enterprise, the aggregate severity rate is calculated for all loans in the relevant state/year combination and the two Enterprise severity rates are averaged.</p><p class="depth0">[c] The ``loss rate'' for any state/year combination examined is calculated by multiplying the average default rate for that state/year combination by the average severity rate for that combination.</p><p class="depth0">[d] The rates of default and Loss Severity of loans in the state/year combination containing at least two consecutive origination years and contiguous areas with a total population equal to or greater than five percent of the population of the United States with the highest loss rate constitutes the Benchmark Loss Experience.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Identification of a New Benchmark Loss Experience</p><p class="depth0">OFHEO will periodically monitor available data and reevaluate the Benchmark Loss Experience using the methodology set forth in this appendix. Using this methodology, OFHEO may identify a new Benchmark Loss Experience that has a higher rate of loss than the Benchmark Loss Experience identified at the time of the issuance of this regulation. In the event such a Benchmark Loss Experience is identified, OFHEO may incorporate the resulting higher loss rates in the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Computation of the Risk-Based Capital Requirement</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Data</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Introduction</p><p class="depth0">[a] The Stress Test requires data on all of an Enterprise's assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, accounting entries, operations and off-balance sheet obligations, as well as economic factors that affect them: interest rates, house prices, rent growth rates, and vacancy rates. The Enterprises are responsible for compiling and aggregating data on at least a quarterly basis into a standard format called the Risk-Based Capital Report (RBC Report). Each Enterprise is required to certify that the RBC Report submission is complete and accurate. Data on economic factors, such as interest rates, are compiled from public sources. The Stress Test uses proprietary and public data directly, and also uses values derived from such data in the form of constants or default values. (See Table 3-1, Sources of Stress Test Input Data.) Data fields from each of these sources for Stress Test computations are described in the following tables and in each section of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[b] The RBC Report includes information for all the loans owned or guaranteed by an Enterprise, as well as securities and derivative contracts, the dollar balances of these instruments and obligations, as well as all characteristics that bear on their behavior under stress conditions. As detailed in the RBC Report, data are required for all the following categories of instruments and obligations:</p><p class="depth0">Mortgages owned by or underlying mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by the Enterprises (whole loans)</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage-related securities</p><p class="depth0">Nonmortgage related securities, whether issued by an Enterprise, (e.g., debt) or held as investments</p><p class="depth0">Derivative contracts</p><p class="depth0">Other off-balance sheet guarantees (e.g., guarantees of private-issue securities).</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-1--Sources of Stress Test Input Data----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Data Source(s) R = RBC Report P = Public Data</p><p class="depth0">F = Fixed Values</p><p class="depth0">Section of this Appendix                  Table              -----------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">R    P    F         Intermediate Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3.1.3, Public Data               3-19, Stress Test Single Family  ...  ...

In addition to their reported data, the Enterprises may report scale factors in order to reconcile this reported data with their published financials (see section 3.10.2[b] of this appendix). If so, specific data items, as indicated, are adjusted by appropriate scale factors before any calculations occur.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2.1 Whole Loan Inputs</p><p class="depth0">[a] Whole loans are individual single family or multifamily mortgage loans. The Stress Test distinguishes between whole loans that the Enterprises hold in their investment portfolios (retained loans) and those that underlie mortgage-backed securities (sold loans). Consistent with Table 3-2, Whole Loan Classification Variables, each Enterprise aggregates the data for loans with similar portfolio (retained or sold), risk, and product characteristics. The characteristics of these loan groups determine rates of mortgage Default, Prepayment and Loss Severity and cash flows.</p><p class="depth0">[b] The characteristics that are the basis for loan groups are called ``classification variables'' and reflect categories, e.g., fixed interest rate versus floating interest rate, or identify a value range, e.g., original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio greater than 80 percent and less than or equal to 90 percent.</p><p class="depth0">[c] All loans with the same values for each of the relevant classification variables included in 3-2 (and where applicable 3-3 and 3-4) comprise a single loan group. For example, one loan group includes all loans with the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0">Single family</p><p class="depth0">Sold portfolio</p><p class="depth0">30-year fixed rate conventional loan</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage age greater than or equal to 36 months and less than 48 months</p><p class="depth0">Original LTV greater than 75 percent and less than or equal to 80 percent</p><p class="depth0">Current mortgage interest rate class greater than or equal to six percent and less than seven percent</p><p class="depth0">Secured by property located in the East North Central Census Division</p><p class="depth0">Relative loan size greater than or equal to 75 percent and less than 100 percent of the average for its state and origination year.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-2--Whole Loan Classification Variables----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Variable                             Description                              Range----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Reporting Date                        The last day of the quarter for the   YYYY0331</p><p class="depth0">loan group activity that is being    YYYY0630</p><p class="depth0">reported to OFHEO                    YYYY0930</p><p class="depth0">YYYY1231----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Enterprise                            Enterprise submitting the loan group  Fannie Mae</p><p class="depth0">data                                 Freddie Mac----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Business Type                         Single family or multifamily          Single family</p><p class="depth0">Multifamily----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portfolio Type                        Retained portfolio or Sold portfolio  Retained Portfolio</p><p class="depth0">Sold Portfolio----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Government Flag                       Conventional or Government insured    Conventional</p><p class="depth0">loan                                 Government----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original LTV                          Assigned LTV classes based on the     LTV<=60</p><p class="depth0">ratio, in percent, between the       6016.0----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Mortgage Interest Rate       Assigned classes for the original     0.0<=Rate<4.0</p><p class="depth0">mortgage interest rate               4.0<=Rate<5.0</p><p class="depth0">5.0<=Rate<6.0</p><p class="depth0">6.0<=Rate<7.0</p><p class="depth0">7.0<=Rate<8.0</p><p class="depth0">8.0<=Rate<9.0</p><p class="depth0">9.0<=Rate<10.0</p><p class="depth0">10.0<=Rate<11.0</p><p class="depth0">11.0<=Rate<12.0</p><p class="depth0">12.0<=Rate<13.0</p><p class="depth0">13.0<=Rate<14.0</p><p class="depth0">14.0<=Rate<15.0</p><p class="depth0">15.0<=Rate<16.0</p><p class="depth0">Rate=16.0----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Age                          Assigned classes for the age of the   0<=Age<=12</p><p class="depth0">loan                                 12180----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rate Reset Period                     Assigned classes for the number of    Period=1</p><p class="depth0">months between rate adjustments      11.5</p><p class="depth0">OFHEO based upon data from both</p><p class="depth0">Enterprises.

mortgages. The Stress Test provides for deliveries of mortgages into the commitments that exist at the start of the Stress Period. These mortgages are grouped into ``Commitment Loan Groups'' that reflect the characteristics of the mortgages that were originated in the six months preceding the start of the Stress Period and securitized by the Enterprise, except that they are assigned coupon rates consistent with the projected delivery month in each interest rate scenario. These Commitment Loan Groups are added to the Enterprise's sold portfolio and the Stress Test projects their performance during the Stress Period. In the down-rate scenario, the Stress Test provides that 100 percent of the mortgages specified in the commitments are delivered within the first three months.

3. Set the Initial Mortgage Interest Rate for each subcategory using the interest rate series consistent with the commitment product type. For fixed rate loans, this rate = INDEXDM.

Project the Ten-Year CMT as specified in the 1992 Act:</p><p class="depth0">a. Down-Rate Scenario. In the Stress Test, the ten-year CMT changes from its starting level to its new level in equal increments over the first twelve months of the Stress Period, and remains constant at the new level for the remaining 108 months of the Stress Period. The new level of the ten-year CMT in the last 108 months of the down-rate scenario equals the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0">1) The average of the ten-year CMT for the nine months prior to the start of the Stress Test, minus 600 basis points; or</p><p class="depth0">2) The average yield of the ten-year CMT for the 36 months prior to the start of the Stress Test, multiplied by 60 percent;
but in no case less than 50 percent of the average for the nine months preceding the start of the Stress Period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Up-Rate Scenario. In the Stress Test, the ten-year CMT changes from its starting level to its new level in equal increments over the first twelve months of the Stress Period, and remains at the new level for the remaining 108 months of the Stress Period. The new level of the ten-year CMT in the last 108 months of the up-rate scenario is the greater of:</p><p class="depth0">1) The average of the ten-year CMT for the nine months prior to the start of the Stress Test, plus 600 basis points; or</p><p class="depth0">2) The average of the ten-year CMT for the 36 months prior to the start of the Stress Test, multiplied by 160 percent;
but in no case greater than 175 percent of the average of the ten-year CMT for the nine months preceding the start of the Stress Period.2. Project the 1-month Treasury and other CMT yields:</p><p class="depth0">a. Down-Rate Scenario. For the down-rate scenario, the new value of each of the other Treasury and CMT yields for the last 108 months of the Stress Test is calculated by multiplying the ten-year CMT by the appropriate ratio from Table 3-26. For the first 12 months of the Stress Period, the other rates are computed in the same way as the ten-year CMT, i.e. from their time zero levels. Each of the other CMTs changes in equal steps in each of the first twelve months of the Stress Period until it reaches the new level for the remaining 108 months of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-26--CMT Ratios to the Ten-Year CMT \1\------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------1 MO / 10 YR                                                     0.68271------------------------------------------------------------------------3 MO / 10 YR                                                     0.73700------------------------------------------------------------------------6 MO / 10 YR                                                     0.76697------------------------------------------------------------------------1 YR / 10 YR                                                     0.79995------------------------------------------------------------------------2 YR / 10 YR                                                     0.86591------------------------------------------------------------------------3 YR / 10 YR                                                     0.89856------------------------------------------------------------------------5 YR / 10 YR                                                     0.94646------------------------------------------------------------------------20 YR / 10 YR                                                    1.06246------------------------------------------------------------------------30 YR / 10 YR                                                   1.03432------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ Source: calculated over the period from May, 1986, through April,</p><p class="depth0">1995.</p><p class="depth0">b. Up-Rate Scenario. In the up-rate scenario, all other Treasury and CMT yields are equal to the ten-year CMT in the last 108 months of the Stress Test. Each of the other yields changes in equal increments over the first twelve months of the Stress Test until it equals the ten-year CMT.3. Project Non-Treasury Interest Rates:</p><p class="depth0">a. Non-Treasury Rates. For each of the non-Treasury interest rates with the exception of mortgage rates, rates during the Stress Test are computed as a proportional spread to the nearest maturity Treasury yield as given in Table 3-27. The proportional spread is the average over the two years prior to the start of the Stress Test, of the difference between the non-Treasury rate and the comparable maturity Treasury yield divided by that Treasury yield. For example, the three month LIBOR proportional spread would be calculated as the two year average of the ratio:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13SE01.008</p><p class="depth0">During the Stress Test, the 3-month LIBOR rate is projected by multiplying the 3-month Treasury yield by 1 plus this average proportional spread.</p><p class="depth0">b. Mortgage Rates. Mortgage interest rates are projected as described in this section for other non-Treasury interest rates, except that an average of the additive, not proportional, spread to the appropriate Treasury interest rate is used. For example, the 30-year Conventional Mortgage Rate spread is projected as the average, over the two years preceding the start of the Stress Test, of: (Conventional Mortgage Rate minus the ten-year CMT). This spread is then added to the ten-year CMT for the 120 months of the Stress Test to obtain the projected Conventional Mortgage Rate.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-27--Non-Treasury Interest Rates------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Rates                      Spread Based on------------------------------------------------------------------------15-year Fixed-rate Mortgage Rate         10-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------30-year Conventional Mortgage Rate       10-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------7-year Balloon Mortgage Rate             (computed from Conventional</p><p class="depth0">Mortgage Rate)------------------------------------------------------------------------Constant Maturity Mortgage Index         10-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Other Non-Treasury Interest Rates------------------------------------------------------------------------Overnight Fed Funds                      1-month Treasury Yield------------------------------------------------------------------------7-day Fed Funds                          1-month Treasury Yield------------------------------------------------------------------------1-month LIBOR                            1-month Treasury Yield------------------------------------------------------------------------1-month Federal Agency Cost of Funds     1-month Treasury Yield------------------------------------------------------------------------1-mo Freddie Mac Reference Bill          1-month Treasury Yield------------------------------------------------------------------------3-month LIBOR                            3-month CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------3-month Federal Agency Cost of Funds     3-month CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------PRIME                                    3-month CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6-month LIBOR                            6-month CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------6-month Federal Agency Cost of Funds     6-month CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------6-month Fed Funds                        6-month CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------FHLB 11th District Cost of Funds         1-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------12-month LIBOR                           1-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------12-mo Moving Treasury Average            1-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------Certificate of Deposits Index            1-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------1-year Federal Agency Cost of Funds      1-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------2-year Federal Agency Cost of Funds      2-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------3-year Federal Agency Cost of Funds      3-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------5-year Federal Agency Cost of Funds      5-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------10-year Federal Agency Cost of Funds     10-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------30-year Federal Agency Cost of Funds     30-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------2-yr Swap                                2-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------3-yr Swap                                3-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------5-yr Swap                                5-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------10-yr Swap                               10-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------30-yr Swap                               30-year CMT------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">c.

The Stress Test recognizes five rating categories (``AAA'', ``AA'', ``A'', ``BBB'', and ``Below BBB and Unrated'') and establishes appropriate credit loss factors that are applied during the Stress Period. Securities rated below BBB are treated as unrated securities, unless OFHEO determines to specify a different treatment upon a showing by an Enterprise that a different treatment is warranted.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2 Counterparty Defaults Input</p><p class="depth0">For counterparties and securities, information on counterparty type and the lowest public rating of the counterparty is required. The Stress Test uses credit ratings issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (``NRSROs'') to assign rating categories to counterparties and securities. If a counterparty or security has different ratings from different rating agencies, i.e., a ``split rating,'' or has a long-term rating and a short-term rating, then the lower rating is used.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.3 Counterparty Defaults Procedures</p><p class="depth0">[a] Apply the following three steps to determine maximum haircuts:1.

Unrated, unsubordinated obligations issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises other than the reporting Enterprise are treated as AAA. Unrated seller-servicers are treated as BBB.</p><p class="depth0">d. The Stress Test will permit a higher rating to be used for an unrated seller-servicer who participates in a multifamily delegated underwriting and servicing program that requires a loss-sharing agreement when: (1) The loss sharing agreement is collateralized by a fully funded reserve account pledged to the Enterprise; and (2) the reserve account is in an amount that is equal to or exceeds the amount that OFHEO has determined to be adequate to support the seller-servicer's loss-sharing obligation under the program. Determinations of the reserve requirement and of the rating that will be permitted will be made on a program-by-program and Enterprise-by-Enterprise basis by the Director.3. Determine Maximum Haircuts. The Stress Test specifies the Maximum</p><p class="depth0">Haircut (i.e., the maximum reduction applied to cash flows</p><p class="depth0">during the Stress Test to reflect the risk of loss due to</p><p class="depth0">counterparty (including security) default) by rating category</p><p class="depth0">and counterparty type as shown in Table 3-31.</p><p class="depth0">a. The Maximum Haircut for a rating category is the product of its default rate and its loss severity rate. For all counterparties, the default rates are 5 percent for AAA, 12.5 percent for AA, 20 percent for A, 40 percent for BBB and 100 percent for Below BBB and Unrated. For non-derivative counterparties, the loss severity rate is 70 percent; for derivative counterparties, it is 10 percent. For all Below BBB and Unrated counterparties, the loss severity rate is 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0">b. For periods prior to the implementation of netting, a separate set of Maximum Haircuts (set forth in Table 3-31) will be applied to derivative contract cash flows

to approximate the impact of the net exposures to derivative contract counterparties (see section 3.8.3, Nonmortgage Instrument Procedures). After the implementation of netting, exposures will be netted as described in section 3.8.3 before the haircut is applied.</p><p class="depth0">c. With the exception of haircuts for the Below BBB and Unrated category, haircuts for all counterparty categories are phased-in linearly over the 120 months of the Stress Period. The Maximum Haircut is applied in month 120 of the Stress Period. Haircuts for the Below BBB and Unrated category are applied fully starting in the first month of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-31--Stress Test Maximum Haircut by Ratings Classification------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Derivative      Derivative</p><p class="depth0">Contract        Contract     Non-Derivative   Number</p><p class="depth0">Ratings     Counterparties  Counterparties     Contract     of Phase-Classification     prior to          after      Counterparties     in</p><p class="depth0">Implementation  Implementation  or Instruments   Months</p><p class="depth0">of Netting      of Netting------------------------------------------------------------------------Cash            0%              0%              0%              N/A------------------------------------------------------------------------AAA             0.3%            0.5%            3.5%            120------------------------------------------------------------------------AA              0.75%           1.25%           8.75%           120------------------------------------------------------------------------A               1.2%            2%              14%             120------------------------------------------------------------------------BBB             2.4%            4%              28%             120------------------------------------------------------------------------Below BBB and   100%            100%            100%            1</p><p class="depth0">Unrated------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.5.4 Counterparty Defaults Outputs</p><p class="depth0">The Maximum Haircut for a given Counterparty Type and Rating Classification is used in section 3.6, Whole Loan Cash Flows, section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, and section 3.8, Nonmortgage Instrument Cash Flows, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Whole Loan Cash Flows</p><p class="depth0">3.6.1 Whole Loan Cash Flows Overview</p><p class="depth0">[a] Loan Aggregation. In the Stress Test calculations (except as described in section 3.6.3.6.4, Mortgage Credit Enhancement, of this appendix), individual loans having similar characteristics are aggregated into Loan Groups as described in section 3.1.2.1, Whole Loan Inputs, of this appendix (RBC Report). All individual loans within a Loan Group are considered to be identical for computational purposes. In the discussions in this section, quantities described as ``loan level'' will actually be computed at the Loan Group level.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Loan Participations. In some cases, an Enterprise may hold only a pari passu fractional ownership interest in a loan. This interest is referred to as a participation, and is specified by the ownership percentage held by the Enterprise (the participation percentage). In such cases, the Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) and Mortgage Payment reported in the RBC Report will be only the Enterprise's participation percentage of the loan's actual UPB and Mortgage Payment. The actual UPB is not explicitly used in the calculations described in this section 3.6 but it is used in the creation of the RBC Report.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Retained Loans vs. Sold Loans. The Stress Test models cash flows from single family and multifamily mortgage loans that are held in portfolio (Retained Loans) and loans that are pooled into Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs) that are sold to investors and guaranteed by the Enterprises (Sold Loans). Together, Retained Loans and Sold Loans are referred to as ``Whole Loans.'' The treatment of cash flows for loans not guaranteed by the Enterprises, e.g., loans backing GNMA Certificates and private label MBSs and REMICs, is discussed in section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[d] Repurchased MBSs. From time to time an Enterprise may repurchase all or part of one of its own previously issued single-class MBSs for its own securities portfolio. At an Enterprise's option, these ``Repurchased MBSs'' may be reported with the underlying Whole Loans for computation in this section 3.6 rather than in section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, of this appendix. In such cases, the Enterprise will report the underlying Whole Loans as sold loans, along with the appropriate Fraction Repurchased and any security unamortized balances associated with the purchase of the MBS (not with the original sale of the underlying loans, which unamortized balances are reported separately).</p><p class="depth0">[e] Sources of Enterprise Whole Loan Cash Flows. For Retained Loans, the Enterprises receive all principal and interest payments on the loans, except for a portion of the interest payment retained by the servicer as compensation (the Servicing Fee). For Sold Loans, the Enterprises receive Guarantee Fees and Float Income. Float Income is the earnings on the investment of loan principal and interest payments (net of the Servicing Fee and Guarantee Fee) from the time these payments are received from the servicer until they are remitted to security holders. The length of this period depends on the security payment cycle (the remittance cycle). For both retained and sold loans, the Enterprises retain 100 percent of their credit losses

and experience amortization of discounts as income and amortization of premiums as expense. For Repurchased MBSs, the Enterprise receives the Fraction Repurchased of the cash flows it remits to investors, and retains 100 percent of the Credit Losses and the Guarantee Fee. See section 3.6.3.7, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows and section 3.6.3.8, Whole Loan Accounting Flows, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[f] Required Inputs. The calculation of Whole Loan cash flows requires mortgage Amortization Schedules, mortgage Prepayment, Default and Loss Severity rates, and Credit Enhancement information. The four mortgage performance components of the Stress Test are single family Default and Prepayment, single family Loss Severity, multifamily Default and Prepayment, and multifamily Loss Severity. Mortgage Amortization Schedules are computed from input data in the RBC Report. (For ARMs, selected interest rate indexes from section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix, are also used.) Prepayment and Default Rates are computed by combining explanatory variables and weighting coefficients according to a set of logistic equations. The explanatory variables are computed from the mortgage Amortization Schedule and external economic variables such as Interest Rates (section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix), historical house-price indexes (HPIs) or rental-price indexes (RPIs), and Stress Period HPI growth rate, RPI and Vacancy Rate (RVR) series from section 3.4, Property Valuation, of this appendix. The weighting coefficients determine the relative importance of the different explanatory variables, and are estimated from a statistical analysis of data from the Benchmark Loss region and time period as described in section 1, Identification of the Benchmark Loss Experience, of this appendix. Mortgage Amortization information is also combined with HPI, RPI and VR series to determine Gross Loss Severity rates, which are offset by Credit Enhancements. Finally, the Amortization Schedules, Default and Prepayment rates and Net Loss Severity rates are combined to produce Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows to the Enterprises for each Loan Group, as well as amortization of any discounts, premiums and fees.</p><p class="depth0">[g] Specification of Mortgage Prepayment. Mortgages are assumed to prepay in full. The model makes no specific provision for partial Prepayments of principal (curtailments).</p><p class="depth0">[h] Specification of Mortgage Default and Loss. Mortgage Defaults are modeled as follows: Defaulting loans enter foreclosure after a number of missed payments (MQ, Months in Delinquency), and are foreclosed upon several months later. Months in Foreclosure (MF) is the total number of missed payments through foreclosure. Upon completion of foreclosure, the loan as such ceases to exist and the property becomes Real Estate Owned by the lender (REO). Foreclosure expenses are paid and MI proceeds received when foreclosure is completed. After several more months (MR, Months in REO), the property is sold, REO expenses are paid, and sales proceeds and other credit enhancements are received. These timing differences are not modeled explicitly in the cash flows, but their economic effect is taken into account by calculating the present value of the Default-related cash flows back to the initial month of Default.</p><p class="depth0">[i] Combining Cash Flows from Scheduled Payments, Prepayments and Defaults. Aggregate Whole Loan Cash Flows, adjusted for the effects of mortgage performance, are based on the following conceptual equation, which is made more explicit in the calculations in the sections specified in section 3.6.2 of this appendix:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13SE01.015</p><p class="depth0">3.6.2 Whole Loan Cash Flows Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Inputs for each stage of the Whole Loan Cash Flows calculation are found in the following sections:</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.3.2, Mortgage Amortization Schedule Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.4.2, Single Family Default and Prepayment Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.5.2, Multifamily Default and Prepayment Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.6.2.2, Single Family Gross Loss Severity Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.6.3.2, Multifamily Gross Loss Severity Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.6.4.2, Mortgage Credit Enhancement Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.7.2, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flow Inputs</p><p class="depth0">Section 3.6.3.8.2, Whole Loan Accounting Flows Inputs, of this appendix</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3 Whole Loan Cash Flows Procedures</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.1 Timing Conventions</p><p class="depth0">[a] Calculations are monthly. The Stress Test operates monthly, with all events of a given type assumed to take place on the same day of the month. For mortgages, unless otherwise specified, all payments and other mortgage-related cash flows that are due on the first day of the month are received on the fifteenth. Biweekly loans are mapped into their closest term-equivalent monthly counterpart.</p><p class="depth0">[b] ``Time Zero'' for Calculations. Time Zero refers to the beginning of the Stress Test. For example, if the 2Q2000 Stress Test uses Enterprise Data as of June 30, ``month zero'' represents conditions as of June 30, the Stress Period begins July 1, and July 2000 is month one of the Stress Test. In this document, UPB0 is the Unpaid Principal Balance of a loan immediately prior to (as of) the start of the Stress Test, i.e. as reported by the Enterprise in the RBC Report. Origination refers to the beginning of the life of the loan, which will be prior to the start of the Stress Test for all loans except those delivered later under Commitments, for which Origination refers to the delivery month (See section 3.2, Commitments, of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">[c] Definition of Mortgage Age. The Mortgage Age at a given time is the number of scheduled mortgage payment dates that have occurred prior to that time, whether or not the borrower has actually made the payments. Prior to the first payment date, the Mortgage Age would be zero. From the first payment date until (but not including) the second loan payment date, the Mortgage Age would be one. The Mortgage Age at Time Zero (A0) is thus the number of scheduled loan payment dates that have occurred prior to the start of the Stress Test. The scheduled payment date for all loans is assumed to be the first day of each month; therefore, the Mortgage Age will be A1 on the first day of the Stress Test (except for Commitments that are delivered after the start of the Stress Test).</p><p class="depth0">[d] Interest Rate Setting Procedure. Mortgage interest is due in arrears, i.e., on the first day following the month in which it is accrued. Thus, a payment due on the first day of month m is for interest accrued during the prior month. For example, for Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) the Mortgage Interest Rate (MIRm) applicable to the July reset is set on the first day of June, and is generally based on the May or April value of the underlying Index, as specified in the loan terms. This Lookback Period (LB) is specified in the Stress Test as a period of one or two months, respectively. Thus, PMTm will be based on MIRm, which is based on INDEXm-1-LB.</p><p class="depth0">[e] Prepayment Interest Shortfall. In some remittance cycles, the period between an Enterprise's receipt of Prepayments and transmittal to investors exceeds a full month. In those cases, the Enterprise must remit an additional month's interest (at the Pass-Through Rate) to MBS investors. See section 3.6.3.7.3, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flow Procedures, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[f] Certain Calculations Extend Beyond the End of the Stress Test. Even though the Stress Test calculates capital only through the ten year Stress Period, certain calculations (for example, the level yield amortization of discounts, premiums and fees, as described in section 3.10, Operations, Taxes, and Accounting, of this appendix) require cash flows throughout the life of the instrument. For such calculations in the Stress Test, the conditions of month 120 are held constant throughout the remaining life of the instrument: specifically, Interest Rates (which are already held constant for months 13 through 120), Prepayment and Default rates for months m 120 are taken to be equal to their respective values in month 120.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.2 Payment Allocation Conventions</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.2.1 Allocation of Mortgage Interest</p><p class="depth0">[a] Components of Mortgage Interest. The interest portion of the Mortgage Payment is allocated among several components. For all Whole Loans, a Servicing Fee is retained by the servicer. For Sold Loans, the Enterprise retains a Guarantee Fee. An additional amount of interest (Spread) \1\ may be deposited into a Spread Account to reimburse potential future credit losses on loans covered by this form of Credit Enhancement, as described further in section 3.6.3.6.4, Mortgage Credit Enhancement, of this appendix. The remaining interest amount is either retained by the Enterprise (Net Yield on Retained Loans) or passed through to MBS investors (Pass-Through Interest on Sold Loans).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The spread may or may not be embedded in the recorded Servicing Fee.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">[b] Effect of Negative Amortization. If the Mortgage Payment is contractually limited to an amount less than the full amount accrued (as may be the case with loans that permit Negative Amortization), then the Servicing Fee, the Guarantee Fee and the

spread are paid in full, and the shortfall is borne entirely by the recipient of the Net Yield or Pass-Through Interest.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Effect of Variable Rates. For ARMs, the Servicing Fee, Guarantee Fee and Spread rates are taken to be constant over time, as they are for Fixed Rate Loans. Thus in the Stress Test the Mortgage Interest Rate and the Net Yield or Pass-through Rate will change simultaneously by equal amounts. All other details of the rate and payment reset mechanisms are modeled in accordance with the contractual terms using the inputs specified in section 3.6.3.3.2, Mortgage Amortization Schedule Inputs, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.2.2 Allocation of Mortgage Principal</p><p class="depth0">[a] Scheduled Principal is that amount of the mortgage payment that amortizes principal. For calculational purposes, when a loan prepays in full the amount specified in the Amortization Schedule is counted as Scheduled Principal, and the rest is Prepayment Principal. For a Balloon Loan, the final Balloon Payment includes the remaining UPB, all of which is counted as Scheduled Principal.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Mortgages that prepay are assumed to prepay in full. Partial Prepayments (curtailments) are not modeled.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Any loan that does not prepay or Default remains on its original Amortization Schedule.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.3 Mortgage Amortization Schedule</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.3.1 Mortgage Amortization Schedule Overview</p><p class="depth0">[a] The Stress Test requires an Amortization Schedule for each Loan Group. A mortgage is paid down, or amortized over time, to the extent that the contractual mortgage payment exceeds the amount required to cover interest due.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Definitions.1. Fully Amortizing Loans. The Amortization Schedule for a mortgage with</p><p class="depth0">age A0 at the beginning of the Stress Test is</p><p class="depth0">generated using the starting UPB (UPB0), the</p><p class="depth0">Remaining Term to Maturity (RM), the remaining Amortization</p><p class="depth0">Term (AT-A0), the remaining Mortgage Payments</p><p class="depth0">(PMTm for m = 1...RM) and Mortgage Interest Rates</p><p class="depth0">(MIRm for m = 1...RM). The Amortization Schedule is</p><p class="depth0">generated by repeating the following three steps iteratively</p><p class="depth0">until the UPB is zero:</p><p class="depth0">a. Interest Due =</p><p class="depth0">UPB x Mortgage Interest Rate</p><p class="depth0">b. Principal Amortization = Payment-Interest Due</p><p class="depth0">c. Next period's UPB =</p><p class="depth0">UPB-Principal Amortization</p><p class="depth0">2. Balloon Loans. A Balloon Loan matures prior to its Amortizing Term, i.e. before the UPB is fully amortized to zero. Computationally, AT-A0 RM, usually by at least 180 months. In order that UPBRM = 0, the principal component of the resulting lump sum final payment (the Balloon Payment, equal to UPBRM-1) is counted as Scheduled Principal, not as a Prepayment.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Special Cases. In general the UPB of a mortgage decreases monotonically over time, i.e. UPBm UPBm+1, reaching zero at maturity except for Balloon Loans as described in [b]2. in this section. However, in practice certain exceptions must be handled.1. Interest-Only Loans. Certain loans are interest-only for all or part</p><p class="depth0">of their term. The monthly payment covers only the interest</p><p class="depth0">due, and the UPB stays constant until maturity (in some</p><p class="depth0">cases), in which case a Balloon Payment is due or a changeover</p><p class="depth0">date (in other cases) at which time the payment is recast so</p><p class="depth0">that the loan begins to amortize over its remaining term. If</p><p class="depth0">the loan does not amortize fully over its remaining term, a</p><p class="depth0">Balloon Payment will be due at maturity.2. Negative Amortization. For some loans, the UPB may increase for a</p><p class="depth0">period of time if the mortgage payment is contractually</p><p class="depth0">limited to an amount that is less than the amount of interest</p><p class="depth0">due, and the remainder is added to the UPB. At some point,</p><p class="depth0">however, the payment must exceed the interest due or else the</p><p class="depth0">loan balance will never be reduced to zero. In the</p><p class="depth0">calculation, this is permitted to occur only for payment-</p><p class="depth0">capped ARMs that contractually specify negative amortization.</p><p class="depth0">Certain types of FRMs, notably Graduated Payment Mortgages</p><p class="depth0"><em>(GPMs)</em> and Tiered Payment Mortgages (TPMs), also have variable</p><p class="depth0">payment schedules that result in negative amortization, but in</p><p class="depth0">the Stress Test all such loans are assumed to have passed</p><p class="depth0">their negative amortization periods.3. Early Amortization.</p><p class="depth0">a. If a borrower has made additional principal payments (curtailments or partial prepayments) on a FRM prior to the start of the Stress Test, the contractual mortgage payment will amortize the loan prior to its final maturity, i.e. UPBm = 0 for some m RM = 0, it must be for one of</p><p class="depth0">three reasons: a data error, an averaging artifact, or an</p><p class="depth0">extension of the Amortization Schedule related to a</p><p class="depth0">delinquency prior to the start of the Stress Test. In any such</p><p class="depth0">case, the Stress Test does not recognize cash flows beyond the</p><p class="depth0">scheduled maturity date and models the performing portion of</p><p class="depth0">UPBRM in month RM as a credit loss.5. Biweekly Loans. Biweekly loans are mapped into the FRM category that</p><p class="depth0">most closely approximates their final maturity.6. Step-Rate (or ``Two-Step'') Loans. Certain loans have an initial</p><p class="depth0">interest rate for an extended period of time (typically</p><p class="depth0">several years) and then ``step'' to a final fixed rate for the</p><p class="depth0">remaining life of the loan. This final fixed rate may be</p><p class="depth0">either a predetermined number or a margin over an index. Such</p><p class="depth0">loans can be exactly represented as ARMs with the appropriate</p><p class="depth0">Initial Mortgage Interest Rate and Initial Rate Period, Index</p><p class="depth0">and Margin (if applicable). If the final rate is a</p><p class="depth0">predetermined rate (e.g., 8 percent per annum) then the ARM's</p><p class="depth0">Maximum and Minimum Rate should be set to that number. The</p><p class="depth0">Rate and Payment Reset Periods should be set equal to the</p><p class="depth0">final rate period after the step.7. Reverse Mortgages. In a reverse mortgage, a borrower receives one or</p><p class="depth0">more payments from the lender and the lender is repaid with a</p><p class="depth0">lump sum when the borrower dies, sells the property or moves</p><p class="depth0">out of the home permanently. The stress test models reverse</p><p class="depth0">mortgages as a ladder of zero-coupon securities:a. 11 proxy securities for each reverse mortgage program are created.b. A 10% conditional payment rate is used to create the zero-coupon</p><p class="depth0">securities that will mature in every year of the stress test.</p><p class="depth0">The zero-coupon securities are a laddered series of floating-</p><p class="depth0">rate coupon-bearing accreting bonds with a first payment date</p><p class="depth0">at maturity.c. The 11th zero-coupon security will mature three months after the</p><p class="depth0">stress test to reflect the 35% of UPB not paid down during the</p><p class="depth0">stress period.d. An OFHEO credit rating equivalent to AAA for the FHA insured programs</p><p class="depth0">and AA for other reverse mortgage programs is assigned.8. Split-Rate ARM Loans. In split-rate ARM loans, the principal portion</p><p class="depth0">of the payment is based on a fixed-rate amortization schedule</p><p class="depth0">while the interest portion is based on a floating rate index.</p><p class="depth0">These multifamily loans are available as fully amortizing</p><p class="depth0">product or with a balloon feature. The stress test model does</p><p class="depth0">not provide treatment for split-rate ARM loans.

The conditional rate is the percentage (by principal balance) of the remaining loans in a Loan Group that defaults or prepays during a given period of time. Computing Default and Prepayment rates for a Loan Group requires information on the Loan Group characteristics at the beginning of the Stress Test, historical and projected interest rates from section 3.3, Interest Rates, and house price growth rates and volatility measures from section 3.4, Property Valuation, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Explanatory Variables. Several explanatory variables are used in the equations to determine Default and Prepayment rates for single family loans: Mortgage Age, Original Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, Probability of Negative Equity, Burnout, the percentage of Investor-owned Loans, Relative Interest Rate Spread, Payment Shock (for ARMs only), Initial Rate Effect (for ARMs only), Yield Curve Slope, Relative Loan Size, and Mortgage Product Type. Regression coefficients (weights) are associated with each variable. All of this information is used to compute conditional quarterly Default and Prepayment rates throughout the Stress Test. The quarterly rates are then converted to monthly conditional Default and Prepayment rates, which are used to calculate Stress Test Whole Loan cash flows and Default losses. See section 3.6.3.7, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[c] The regression coefficients for each Loan Group will come from one of three models.

The Loss Severity rate is expressed as a fraction of the Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) at the time of Default. The Stress Test calculates Loss Severity rates for each Loan Group for each month of the Stress Period. Funding costs (and offsetting revenues) of defaulted loans are captured by discounting the Loss Severity elements using a cost-of-funds interest rate that varies during the Stress Period. Table 3-41 specifies the Stress Test Loss Severity timeline.

Mortgage Defaults are modeled as follows: defaulting loans enter foreclosure after a number of months (MQ, Months in Delinquency) and are foreclosed upon several months later. MF (Months in Foreclosure) is the total number of missed payments. Upon completion of foreclosure, the loan as such ceases to exist and the property becomes Real Estate Owned by the lender (REO). After several more months (MR, Months in REO), the property

is sold. Foreclosure expenses are paid and MI proceeds (and, for multifamily loans, loss sharing proceeds) are received when foreclosure is completed. REO expenses are paid, and sales proceeds and other Credit Enhancements are received, when the property is sold. These timing differences are not modeled explicitly in the cash flows, but their economic effect is taken into account by present-valuing the default-related cash flows to the month of Default.</p><p class="depth0">[d] Gross Loss Severity, Credit Enhancement, and Net Loss Severity. The calculation of mortgage losses is divided into three parts. First, Gross Loss Severity is determined by expressing the principal loss plus unpaid interest plus expenses as a percentage of the loan UPB at the time of Default (section 3.6.3.6.2, Single Family Gross Loss Severity, and section 3.6.3.6.3, Multifamily Gross Loss Severity, of this appendix). Second, Credit Enhancements (CEs) are applied according to their terms to offset losses on loans that are covered by one or more CE arrangements (section 3.6.3.6.4, Mortgage Credit Enhancement, of this appendix). Finally, to account for the timing of these different cash flows, net losses are discounted back to the month in which the Default initially occurred (section 3.6.3.6.5, Single Family and Multifamily Net Loss Severity, of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.6.2 Single Family Gross Loss Severity</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.6.2.1 Single Family Gross Loss Severity Overview</p><p class="depth0">The Loss Severity calculation adds the discounted present value of various costs and offsetting revenues associated with the foreclosure of single family properties, expressed as a fraction of UPB on the date of Default.

Unpaid interest at the Pass-Through Rate must be paid to MBS holders until the Defaulted loan is repurchased from the MBS pool.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Foreclosure Expenses and REO Expenses.

Credit Enhancements (CE) reimburse losses on individual loans. The CE most often utilized by the Enterprises at the present time is primary Mortgage Insurance (MI) including both private and government MI or loan guarantees (e.g. FHA, VA), which pays claims up to a given limit on each loan. Most other types of CE do not limit the amount payable on each loan individually, but do limit the aggregate amount available under a given CE arrangement or Contract. These two types of CE must be computed differently. To denote this distinction, this appendix will refer to ``Loan Limit'' and ``Aggregate Limit'' CE types. Loan Limit CE includes Mortgage Insurance for single family loans and Loss-Sharing Arrangements (LSA) for multifamily loans. Aggregate Limit CE includes Pool Insurance, Spread Accounts, Letters of Credit, Cash or Collateral Accounts, and Subordination Agreements. For operational convenience in the Stress Test, the Aggregate Limit classification also includes Unlimited Recourse, which has neither loan-level nor aggregate-level coverage limits, and Modified Pool Insurance, Limited Recourse, Limited Indemnification and FHA risk-sharing, which may have both loan-level and aggregate-level coverage limits.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Loan Limit Credit Enhancements. Loan Limit Credit Enhancements are applied to every covered loan individually, without regard to how much has been paid on any other covered loan. For example, an MI policy covers losses on an individual loan up to a specified limit. If every loan with MI were to Default, every claim would be payable regardless of the total outlay on the part of the MI provider. Loss Sharing Arrangements on multifamily loans operate the same way.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Aggregate Limit Credit Enhancements. Aggregate Limit Credit Enhancements cover a group of loans on an aggregate basis. In most such arrangements, the coverage for any individual loan is unlimited, except that the total outlay by the provider cannot exceed a certain aggregate limit. Thus, the amount of Aggregate Limit coverage available to an individual loan depends, in practice, on how much has been paid on all previous claims under the specified Contract.</p><p class="depth0">[d] Credit Enhancement Counterparty Defaults. CE payments from a rated counterparty are subject to Haircuts to simulate counterparty failures during the Stress Test. These Haircuts are based on the rating of the counterparty or guarantor immediately prior to the Stress Test, and are applied each month as described in section 3.5, Counterparty Defaults, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[e] Stress Test Application of Credit Enhancement. The Stress Test calculates mortgage cash flows for aggregated Loan Groups, within which individual loans are assumed to have identical characteristics, and therefore are not differentiated in the computations. However, a single Loan Group may include loans with Loan Limit CE and/or one or more types of Aggregate Limit CE. Additionally, this coverage may come from a rated provider or from cash or cash-equivalent collateral. Therefore, for computational purposes it is necessary to distinguish among the different possible CE combinations that each loan or subset of loans in a Loan Group may have. In the Stress Test, this is accomplished by creating Distinct Credit Enhancement Combinations (DCCs).1. Distinct Credit Enhancement Combinations. When aggregating individual</p><p class="depth0">loans into Loan Groups for the RBC Report, the applicable CE</p><p class="depth0">arrangements will have been identified for each loan:</p><p class="depth0">a. Loan Group (LG) Number</p><p class="depth0">b. Initial UPB of individual loan</p><p class="depth0">c. Rating of MI or LSA Counterparty</p><p class="depth0">d. Loan-Limit Coverage Percentage for MI or LSA</p><p class="depth0">e. Contract Number for Aggregate Limit CE, First Priority</p><p class="depth0">f. Contract Number for Aggregate Limit CE, Second Priority</p><p class="depth0">g. Contract Number for Aggregate Limit CE, Third Priority</p><p class="depth0">h. Contract Number for Aggregate Limit CE, Fourth Priority
2. Individual loans for which all of the entries in step 1) of this</p><p class="depth0">section (except UPB and Loan-Limit Coverage Percent) are</p><p class="depth0">identical, are aggregated into a DCCs. For example, all loans</p><p class="depth0">in a given Loan Group with MI from a AAA-rated provider and no</p><p class="depth0">other CE would comprise one DCC whose balance is the aggregate</p><p class="depth0">of the included loans and whose MI Coverage Percent is the</p><p class="depth0">weighted average of that of the included loans. In each month,</p><p class="depth0">within each Loan Group, for each DCC, each applicable form of</p><p class="depth0">CE is applied in priority order to reduce Gross Loss Severity</p><p class="depth0">as much as possible to zero. The total CE payment for each</p><p class="depth0">DCC, as a percentage of Defaulted UPB is converted to a total</p><p class="depth0">CE payment for each Loan Group and then factored into the</p><p class="depth0">calculation of Net Loss Severity in section 3.6.3.6.5, Single</p><p class="depth0">Family and Multifamily Net Loss Severity, of this appendix.3. DCC First and Second Priority Available Aggregate CE Balance. In the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test, First and Second Priority Available Aggregate CE</p><p class="depth0">Balances are allocated to the DCCs that are parties to each</p><p class="depth0">Contract on a pro-rata basis. Third and Fourth Priority</p><p class="depth0">Aggregate Limit Contracts are not modeled because they are</p><p class="depth0">extremely rare. In each month of the Stress Test these CE</p><p class="depth0">Balances, adjusted by appropriate Haircuts, are reduced by the</p><p class="depth0">losses incurred by each DCC that is a party to each Contract.</p><p class="depth0">Spread Account deposits, if applicable, are included in the</p><p class="depth0">First and Second Priority DCC Available Aggregate CE Balances.</p><p class="depth0">a. Spread Accounts may take one of two forms: Balance-Limited, or Deposit-Limited. A Balance-Limited Spread Account receives monthly spread payments based on the UPB of the covered loans until a required balance is achieved and maintained. Any amounts paid to cover losses must be replenished by future spread payments from the covered loans that are still performing. Thus, there is no known limit to the amount of spread deposits that may be made over the life of the covered loans. In contrast, for a Deposit-Limited Spread Account the limit is similar to a customary coverage limit. The total amount of spread deposits made into the account is limited to a maximum amount specified in the Contract.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the Stress Test, the Available Contract Balance of a Spread Account is adjusted prior to the calculation of the DCC Available Balance as reported in the RBC Report. For each Spread Account contract, the Enterprises report the Remaining Limit Amount, which represents the maximum dollar amount of additional spread deposits that could be required under the Contract. For Deposit-Limited Spread Accounts, this amount is the maximum remaining dollar amount of spread deposits required under the Contract. For Balance-Limited Spread Accounts, this amount is defined as one-twelfth of the annualized spread rate times the UPB of the covered loans at the start of the Stress Test times the weighted average Remaining term to Maturity of those loans. However, the maximum amount of spread deposits that could be received will generally be higher than the amount reasonably expected to be received during the Stress Test, because the UPB of the covered loans, which is the basis for determining the amounts of future spread deposits, declines over the term of the Contract due to Amortization, Defaults, and Prepayments. Therefore, the Enterprises report an adjusted Available Contract Balance for both types of Spread Accounts before reporting the DCC Available Balance by adding the lesser of the Remaining Limit Amount or one-twelfth of the spread rate times the UPB of the covered loans at the start of the stress test times 60 months.</p><p class="depth0">c. Modified Pool Insurance, Limited Recourse, Limited Indemnification and FHA risk-sharing contracts may have both loan-level and aggregate-level coverage limits. To account for this aspect of these types of Aggregate Limit CE, the Enterprises report a DCC Loan Level Coverage Limit Amount, which represents the share of each loss after deductibles (such as MI or First Priority Contract payments) covered by a given MPI Contract. (The Loan Level Coverage Limit Amount takes the value of one if the Contract is not of this type, representing that 100 percent of losses are covered by other types of Contracts).</p><p class="depth0">d. In practice, Unlimited Recourse Contracts have neither loan-level nor aggregate-level coverage limits. However, the Enterprises report the Available Aggregate CE Balance of Unlimited Recourse Contracts as the summation of the Original UPB of all covered loans.</p><p class="depth0">e. The Available Aggregate CE Balances of Collateral Account Contracts funded with anything other than Cash or Cash-

equivalents are discounted by thirty percent to account for market risk in securities that are not cash equivalents.</p><p class="depth0">f. Enterprise Loss Positions are treated as Aggregate Limit CE in terms of reducing remaining losses eligible to be covered by a next-priority Contract. However, since Enterprise Loss Positions are typically a deductible for other forms of supplementary coverage, payments from such accounts do not reduce loss severity.</p><p class="depth0">[f] Multiple Layers of Credit Enhancement. For loans with more than one type of Credit Enhancement, MI or Loss Sharing is applied first, and then other types of CE (if available) are applied in priority order to the remaining losses. MI and Loss Sharing claims are payable regardless of whether (and to what extent) a loan is also covered by other forms of CE. MI is unique in that the MI payment is based on a percentage of a Claim Amount equal to the entire Defaulted UPB plus expenses, not the actual loss incurred upon liquidation. Therefore, an Enterprise can receive MI payments on a defaulted loan in excess of the actual realized loss on that loan. However, it is frequently the case that MI payments are insufficient to cover the entire loss amount. In such cases, one or more types of Aggregate Limit CE may be available to make up the deficiency. Unlike MI claims, however, the Claim Amounts for Loss Sharing and for all Aggregate Limit CE types do depend on the actual losses incurred; and unlike Loss Sharing and MI, Claim Amounts payable under other forms of CE are net of payments received on account of other forms of CE. When a single loan is covered by multiple forms of CE, the order in which they are to be applied (First Priority, Second Priority, etc.) must be specified. To avoid double-counting, a higher-numbered priority CE only covers losses that were not covered by a lower-numbered priority CE.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.6.4.2 Mortgage Credit Enhancement Inputs</p><p class="depth0">[a] For each Loan Group, the inputs in Table 3-46 are required:</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-46--CE Inputs for Each Loan Group----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Variable                           Description                                 Source----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPBORIGLG                       Origination UPB                          RBC Report----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPB0LG and UPBmLG               Initial UPB and UPB in month m =         section 3.6.3.3.4, Mortgage</p><p class="depth0">0,1...120                                Amortization Schedule Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LTVORIGLG                       Original LTV                             RBC Report----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DEFmLG and PERFmLG              Defaulting and Performing Fractions of   section 3.6.3.4.4, Single Family</p><p class="depth0">Initial Loan Group UPB in month m =      Default and Prepayment Outputs and</p><p class="depth0">1...120                                  section 3.6.3.5.4, Multifamily Default</p><p class="depth0">and Prepayment Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CLMmMI,LG                       MI Claim Amount and LSA Claim Amount     section 3.6.3.6.2, Single Family GrossCLMmLSA,LG                                                                Loss Severity and section 3.6.3.6.3,</p><p class="depth0">Multifamily Gross Loss Severity----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GLSmLG                          Gross Loss Severity                      section 3.6.3.6.2, Single Family Gross</p><p class="depth0">Loss Severity and section 3.6.3.6.3,</p><p class="depth0">Multifamily Gross Loss Severity----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">[b] For each DCC covering loans in the Loan Group, the inputs in Table 3-47 are required:</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-47--Inputs for Each Distinct CE Combination (DCC)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Variable                               Description                              Source----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PDCC                                 Percent of Initial Loan Group UPB            RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">represented by individual loan(s) in a DCC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RMI,DCC or RLSA,DCC                  Credit rating of Loan Limit CE (MI or LSA)   RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">Counterparty----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">CMI,DCC or CLSA,DCC                  Weighted Average Coverage Percentage for MI  RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">or LSA Coverage (weighted by Initial UPB)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AB0DCC,C1                            DCC Available First Priority CE Balance      RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">immediately prior to start of the Stress</p><p class="depth0">Test----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AB0DCC,C2                            DCC Available Second Priority CE Balance     RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">immediately prior to start of the Stress</p><p class="depth0">Test----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RDCC,C1                              DCC Credit Rating of First Priority CE       RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">Provider or Counterparty;

In the Stress Test calculations, payments are indexed by the month in which they are received. Therefore, interest received in month m was earned in month m-1. However, principal is accounted for in the month received.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Deferred Balances are amortized over the remaining life of the asset. Therefore, these calculations go beyond the end of the Stress Test if the Remaining Maturity (RM) is greater than the 120 months of the Stress Test. The projection of cash flows beyond the end of the Stress Test is discussed in the individual sections where the cash flows are first calculated. In general, for interest rate indexes, monthly Prepayment rates and monthly Default rates, the value for m = 120 is used for all months 120 120.</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.8.2 Whole Loan Accounting Flows Inputs</p><p class="depth0">The inputs in Table 3-54 are required to compute Accounting Flows:</p><p class="depth0">Table 3-54--Inputs for Whole Loan Accounting Flows----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Variable                                 Description                              Source----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------RM                                    Remaining Term to Maturity in months           RBC Report----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPD0                                  Sum of all unamortized discounts, premiums,    RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">fees, commissions, etc. for the loan group,</p><p class="depth0">such that the unamortized balance equals the</p><p class="depth0">book value minus the face value for the loan</p><p class="depth0">group at the start of the Stress Test,</p><p class="depth0">adjusted by the Unamortized Balance Scale</p><p class="depth0">Factor----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NYR0                                  Net Yield Rate at time zero                    section 3.6.3.3.4, Mortgage</p><p class="depth0">Amortization Schedule</p><p class="depth0">Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PUPBm                                 Performing Loan Group UPB in months m = 0 ...  section 3.6.3.7.4, Stress</p><p class="depth0">RM                                             Test Whole Loan Cash Flow</p><p class="depth0">Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PTR0                                  Pass-Through Rate at time zero                 section 3.6.3.3.4, Mortgage</p><p class="depth0">Amortization Schedule</p><p class="depth0">Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPUPBm                                Security Performing UPB in months m = 0 ...    section 3.6.3.7.4, Stress</p><p class="depth0">RM                                             Test Whole Loan Cash Flow</p><p class="depth0">Outputs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">SUPD0                                 The sum of all unamortized discounts,          RBC Report</p><p class="depth0">premiums, fees, commissions, etc. associated</p><p class="depth0">with the securities modeled using the Wtd</p><p class="depth0">Ave Percent Repurchased, such that the</p><p class="depth0">unamortized balance equals the book value</p><p class="depth0">minus the face value for the relevant</p><p class="depth0">securities at the start of the Stress Test,</p><p class="depth0">adjusted by the percent repurchased and the</p><p class="depth0">Security Unamortized Balance Scale Factor----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.8.3 Whole Loan Accounting Flows Procedures</p><p class="depth0">3.6.3.8.3.1 Accounting for Retained and Sold Whole Loans</p><p class="depth0">[a] Complete the following three steps to account for Retained and Sold loans:1.

MBSs and Derivative Mortgage Securities are issued by the Enterprises, Ginnie Mae and private issuers. MRBs are issued by State and local governments or their instrumentalities. For computational purposes, certain Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) backed by mortgages (Mortgage ABSs backed by manufactured housing loans, second mortgages or home equity loans) are treated as REMICs in the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Cash flows from Single Class MBSs represent the pass-through of all principal and interest payments, net of servicing and guarantee fees, on the underlying pools of mortgages. Cash flows from Multi-Class MBSs and Derivative Mortgage Securities represent a specified portion of the cash flows produced by an underlying pool of mortgages and/or Mortgage-Related Securities, determined according to rules set forth in offering documents for the securities. MRBs may have specific maturity schedules and call provisions, whereas MBSs have only expected maturities and, in most cases, no issuer call provision (other than ``cleanup calls'' if the pool balance becomes quite small). However, the timing of principal payments for MRBs is still closely related to that of their underlying mortgage collateral. The Stress Test treats most MRBs in a manner similar to single class MBSs. Finally, a small number of Enterprise and private label REMIC securities for which modeling information is not readily available and which are not modeled by a commercial information service (referred to as ``miscellaneous MRS'') are treated separately.</p><p class="depth0">[c] In addition to reflecting the defaults of mortgage borrowers during the Stress Period, the Stress Test considers the possibility of issuer Default on Mortgage-Related Securities. Credit impairments throughout the Stress Period are based on the rating of these securities, and are modeled by reducing contractual interest payments and ``writing down'' principal. No Credit Losses are assumed for the Enterprise's own securities and Ginnie Mae securities (see section 3.5.3, Counterparty Defaults Procedures, of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">[d] The calculation of cash flows for Mortgage-Related Securities requires information from the Enterprises identifying their holdings, publicly available information characterizing the securities, and information on the interest rate, mortgage performance and credit rating (for rated securities).</p><p class="depth0">[e] Cash and accounting flows--monthly principal and interest payments and amortization expense--are produced for each month of the Stress Period for each security. (Principal- and interest-only securities pay principal or interest respectively.)

that never change hands.

For example, the mortgage-linked derivative contract cash flows require inputs describing the performance of the mortgage assets to which they are linked, including Single Family Default and Prepayment rates (See section 3.6.3.4, Single Family Default and Prepayment Rates, of this appendix). Mortgage-linked derivative contract identification numbers (Asset IDs) are used to link the derivative contract to the required pool information that will be used to calculate the cash flows of the corresponding swap.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3 Nonmortgage Instrument Procedures</p><p class="depth0">In general, non mortgage instruments are modeled according to their terms. The general methodology for calculating cash flows for principal and interest payments is described in this section and is not intended to serve as definitive text for calculating all possible present and future complex instruments. As mentioned in section 3.8.2, Nonmortgage Instrument Inputs, of this appendix, there are some instruments that may require additional input information and calculation methodologies. Simplifying assumptions are made for some instrument terms until they can be modeled more precisely.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.1 Apply Specific Calculation Simplifications</p><p class="depth0">[a] In order to produce cash flows, accruals, or amortization of deferred balances, the following simplifications are used for all instruments to which they apply. Should the language in any other portion of section 3.8, Nonmortgage Instrument Cash Flows, of this appendix, seem to conflict with a statement in this section, the language in section 3.8.3.1 takes precedence.1. For day count methodology, use one of three methodologies 30/360,</p><p class="depth0">Actual/360, and Actual/365. All special day counts (i.e.</p><p class="depth0">Actual/366 B, Actual/366 S, Actual/366 E, and Actual/Actual)</p><p class="depth0">are treated as Actual/365.2. Set the first index reset date to the First Coupon Date. If the Issue</p><p class="depth0">Date is later than the start of the Stress Test, use the</p><p class="depth0">Current Coupon Rate to determine the interest paid from Issue</p><p class="depth0">Date to First Coupon Date. When a calculation requires a rate</p><p class="depth0">that occurs before the start of the Stress Test, use the</p><p class="depth0">Current Coupon Rate. This applies to interest accrued but not</p><p class="depth0">paid for the start of the Stress test and to rate indexes</p><p class="depth0">where applying a Look Back Period requires data prior to the</p><p class="depth0">start of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">a. If periodic caps are zero, change them to 999.99; If periodic floors are greater than 1, change them to zero.</p><p class="depth0">b. For instruments which have principal balance changes other than those caused by compounding interest, perform calculations as if the principal changes occur only on coupon dates (coupon dates on the fixed-rate leg for swaps) on or later than the first principal change date.</p><p class="depth0">c. When using a rate index for a specified term in an option exercise rule or as an index, assume that rate is appropriate for the calculation. Do not convert from bond equivalent yield to another yield form for a discount, monthly pay, quarterly pay, semi-annual pay or annual pay instrument.3. When applying the option exercise rule:</p><p class="depth0">a. For zero coupon and discount securities, instruments with European options, and zero coupon swaps, evaluate option exercise only on dates listed in the instrument's option exercise schedule. For Bermudan options, evaluate option exercise on the first option date in the instrument's option exercise schedule and subsequent coupon dates (coupon dates on the fixed-rate leg for swaps). For American options, evaluate option exercise on the first option date in the instrument's option exercise schedule and subsequent monthly anniversaries of the instrument's first coupon date.</p><p class="depth0">b. Assume all call/put premiums/discounts are zero except for zero coupon instruments (including zero coupon swaps and discount notes). For these exceptions, when calculating a rate to compare with the Enterprise Cost of Funds, use the yield to maturity calculated by equating the face or notional amount plus the unamortized discount at the start of the Stress Test to the present value of the face or notional amount at maturity.</p><p class="depth0">c. Assume basis swaps and floating rate securities have no cancel, put, or call options.</p><p class="depth0">d. If the remaining maturity is greater than 360 months, use the equivalent-maturity Enterprise Cost of Funds as if the remaining maturity is 360 months.</p><p class="depth0">e. In the Stress Test, no preferred stock issued by the Enterprise will be called.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.2 Determine the Timing of Cash Flows</p><p class="depth0">Project payment dates from the payment date immediately prior to the start of the stress test according to the Payment Frequency, First Coupon Date, and Maturity Date.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.3 Obtain the Principal Factor Amount at Each Payment Date</p><p class="depth0">[a] Where there is no amortization or prepayment of principal, the Principal Factor Amount is 1.0 for each payment date until the stated Maturity Date, when it becomes zero.</p><p class="depth0">[b] For debt and debt-linked derivative contracts that amortize, either a principal or a notional amortization schedule must be provided. If amortization information is unavailable, then the Principal Factor Amount is 1.0 for each payment date until the stated Maturity Date, when it becomes zero.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Monthly prepayment rates are 3.5 percent for fixed-rate and 2.0 percent for floating-rate asset-backed securities. Furthermore, asset-backed securities are modeled through a commercial information service where possible. Instruments that cannot be modeled through the commercial information service are treated in accordance with section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[d] In the case of mortgage-linked derivative contracts, notional amounts are amortized based on the characteristics of the underlying pool in the manner described for principal balances of mortgage-backed securities held by an Enterprise in section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.4 Calculate the Coupon Factor</p><p class="depth0">The Coupon Factor applicable to a given period, which applies to dividends also, depends on day count conventions used to calculate the interest payments for the instrument. For example, the Coupon Factor for a bond that pays interest quarterly based on a non-compounded 30/360 convention would be 3 (representing the number of months in a quarter) times 30 days divided by 360 days, or 0.25.

The principal payment equals the amount of principal outstanding at the end of the previous period less the principal outstanding at the end of the current period, or zero if the instrument has a notional amount.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.6 Project Interest and Dividend Cash Flows</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.6.1 Non-Complex Financial Instruments</p><p class="depth0">[a] Fixed-Rate Instruments.

Interest payments equal zero.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Discount Notes. Interest payments equal zero.</p><p class="depth0">[d] Floating-Rate Instruments. Interest payments are calculated as principal outstanding multiplied by the coupon for the current period. The current period coupon is calculated by adding a spread to the appropriate interest rate index and multiplying by the Coupon Factor. The coupon for the current period is set to this amount as long as the rate lies between the periodic and lifetime maximum and minimum rates. Otherwise the coupon is set to the maximum or minimum rate.</p><p class="depth0">[e] Interest Rate Caps and Floors. These derivative instruments pay or receive interest only if the underlying index is above a Strike Rate (for caps) or below it (for floors). Interest payments are based on notional amounts instead of principal amounts.1. The interest payment on a long cap is the Original Face multiplied by</p><p class="depth0">the amount, if any, by which the index exceeds the Strike</p><p class="depth0">Rate, as defined by the equation in Table 3-68. The interest</p><p class="depth0">payment on a long floor is the Original Face multiplied by the</p><p class="depth0">amount, if any, by which the index is below the Strike Rate.</p><p class="depth0">Otherwise interest payments are zero for caps and floors.</p><p class="depth0">Interest payments are either paid or received depending on</p><p class="depth0">whether the Enterprise is in a long or short position in a cap</p><p class="depth0">or a floor.2.

Each swap leg (pay side or receive side) is modeled as a separate instrument, with interest payments based on the same notional amount but different interest rates.1. For debt- and investment-linked swaps, each leg's interest payment is</p><p class="depth0">determined in the same manner as payments for fixed-rate,</p><p class="depth0">floating-rate or zero coupon instruments as described in</p><p class="depth0">paragraph [a], [b] and [d] of this section.2. For mortgage-linked swaps, calculate the reduction in the notional</p><p class="depth0">amount due to scheduled monthly principal payments (taking</p><p class="depth0">into account both lifetime and reset period caps and floors),</p><p class="depth0">Prepayments, and Defaults of the reference MBS or index pool.</p><p class="depth0">Reduce the notional amount of the swap for the previous period</p><p class="depth0">by this amount to determine the notional amount for the</p><p class="depth0">current period.

These complexities can include more sophisticated variants of characteristics such as principal or notional amortization schedules, interest accrual methodologies, coupon reset formulas, and option features. In these instances, additional information may be required to completely specify the contractual cash flows or a proxy treatment for these instruments.</p><p class="depth0">[b] An example of an instrument with complex features is an indexed amortizing swap. This instrument is non-standard because its notional amount declines in a way that is related to the level of interest rates. Its amortization table contains a notional amount reduction factor for a given range of interest rates. To compute cash flows for this instrument, reduce the notional amount on each payment date as specified in the amortization table. (The notional amount at the beginning of the Stress Period is given as an input to the calculation.)</p><p class="depth0">[c] Special treatment is also required for foreign-currency-linked notes, the redemption value of which is tied to a specific foreign exchange rate. These require special treatment because the Stress Test does not forecast foreign currency rates. If these instruments are currency-hedged, then the note plus the hedge comprise a synthetic debt instrument for which only the pay side of the swap is modeled. If these instruments are not currency-hedged, the following treatment applies:1. In the up-rate scenario, the U.S. dollar per unit of foreign currency</p><p class="depth0">ratio is increased in proportion to the increase in the ten-</p><p class="depth0">year CMT; therefore, the amount of an interest or principal</p><p class="depth0">payment is increased accordingly. For example, if the ten-year</p><p class="depth0">CMT shifts up by 50 percent, then the U.S. dollar per unit of</p><p class="depth0">foreign currency ratio shifts up by 50 percent. In the Stress</p><p class="depth0">Test, the payment would be multiplied by 1.5.2. In the down-rate scenario, the foreign currency per U.S. dollar ratio</p><p class="depth0">is decreased in proportion to the decrease in the ten-year</p><p class="depth0">CMT.</p><p class="depth0">[d] Futures and Options on Futures also require special treatment:1. Settle positions on their expiration dates. Exercise only in-the-</p><p class="depth0">money options (settlement value greater than zero).2. Settle all contracts for cash3. Calculate the cash settlement amount--the change in price of a</p><p class="depth0">contract from the contract trade date to its expiration date.</p><p class="depth0">Calculate the price on the expiration date based on stress</p><p class="depth0">test interest rates (or, as necessary, forward rates</p><p class="depth0">extrapolated from these rates).4. Amortize amounts received or paid at the expiration date into income</p><p class="depth0">or expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the</p><p class="depth0">underlying instrument (in the case of an option on a futures</p><p class="depth0">contract, the life of the instrument underlying the futures</p><p class="depth0">contract).5. Amortize an option premium on a straight-line basis over the life of</p><p class="depth0">the option. (Amortize any remaining balances upon option</p><p class="depth0">exercise.)</p><p class="depth0">[e] Swaptions also require special treatment:1. Assume swap settlement (i.e., initiation of the underlying swap) when</p><p class="depth0">a swap option is exercised.2. Calculate a ``normalized'' fixed-pay coupon by subtracting the spread</p><p class="depth0">over the index, if any, from the coupon on the fixed-rate swap</p><p class="depth0">leg.3. For all exercise types (American, Bermudan, and European), consistent</p><p class="depth0">with RBC Rule section 3.8.3.7, assume exercise by the party</p><p class="depth0">holding the swap option if the equivalent maturity Enterprise</p><p class="depth0">Cost of Funds is more thana. 50 basis points above the normalized fixed-pay coupon, for a pay-</p><p class="depth0">fixed swaption (a call or `payor'' swaption), orb. 50 basis points below the normalized fixed pay coupon for a receive-</p><p class="depth0">fixed swaption (a put or `receiver' swaption).4. Amortize option premiums on a straight-line basis over the option</p><p class="depth0">term. (Amortize any remaining balances upon option exercise).</p><p class="depth0">[f] CPI-Linked Instruments also require special treatment. The stress test lacks the ability to accommodate floating-rate instruments that reset in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Enterprise issuance of CPI-linked instruments is tied to swap market transactions intended to create desired synthetic debt structure and terms. In such cases, the true economic position nets to the payment terms of the related derivative contract. Accordingly, in order to accommodate and address the existence of CPI-linked instruments in the Enterprises' portfolios, the net synthetic position shall be evaluated in the stress test. That is, for CPI-linked instruments tied to swap transactions that are formally linked in a hedge accounting relationship, the Enterprise should substitute the CPI-linked instrument's coupon payment terms with those of the related swap contract.</p><p class="depth0">[g] Pre-refunded municipal bonds also require special treatments. Pre-refunded municipal bonds are collateralized by securities that are structured to fund all the cash flows

of the refunded municipal bonds until the bonds are callable. Since the call date for the bonds, also referred to as the pre-refunded date, is a more accurate representation of the payoff date than the contractual maturity date of the bonds, the stress test models the bonds to mature on the call date.</p><p class="depth0">[h] If a financial instrument's inputs are described in section 3.1, Data, of this appendix, then model the instrument according to its terms; however, the Director reserves the authority to determine a more appropriate treatment if modeling the instrument according to its terms does not capture the instrument's impact on Enterprise risk. If the financial instrument's inputs are not described in section 3.1, then treat it as described in section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.7 Apply Call, Put, or Cancellation Features, if Applicable</p><p class="depth0">[a] In some cases, principal and interest cash flows may be altered due to options imbedded in individual financial instruments. Securities can be called or put and contracts can be cancelled at the option of the Enterprise or the counterparty. The Option Type, Exercise Convention Type, and the Start Date determine when an option may be exercised. There are three standard Exercise Convention Types, all of which are accommodated in the Stress Test:</p><p class="depth0">American--Exercise can occur at any time after the Start Date of the option.</p><p class="depth0">European--Exercise can occur only on the Start Date of the option.</p><p class="depth0">Bermudan--Exercise can occur only on specified dates, usually on coupon payment dates between the Start Date of the option and maturity.</p><p class="depth0">[b] The options are treated in the following manner for each date on which the option can be exercised:1. Project cash flows for the instrument with the imbedded option</p><p class="depth0">assuming that the option is not exercised. If the instrument</p><p class="depth0">is tied to an index, assume that the index remains constant at</p><p class="depth0">its value on that date.2. Determine the discount rate that equates the outstanding balance of</p><p class="depth0">the security plus option premium and accrued interest to the</p><p class="depth0">sum of the discounted values of the projected cash flows. This</p><p class="depth0">discount rate is called the yield-to-maturity.3. Convert the yield-to-maturity to a bond-equivalent yield and compare</p><p class="depth0">the bond-equivalent yield with the projected Enterprise Cost</p><p class="depth0">of Funds for debt with an equivalent maturity. Interpolate</p><p class="depth0">linearly if the maturity is not equal to one of the maturities</p><p class="depth0">specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix.4. If the equivalent-maturity Enterprise Cost of Funds is lower (higher)</p><p class="depth0">than 50 basis points below (above) the bond-equivalent yield</p><p class="depth0">of the callable (putable) instrument, then the option is</p><p class="depth0">exercised. Otherwise, the option is not exercised, and it is</p><p class="depth0">evaluated at the next period when the option can be exercised.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Some swap derivative contracts have cancellation features that allow either counterparty to terminate the contracts on certain dates. The cancellation feature is evaluated by comparing the fixed-rate leg of the swap to the Enterprise Cost of Funds. If either leg of the swap is cancelled, then the other leg is cancelled concurrently. Cancellable swaps are treated in the following manner:1. For each period when an option can be exercised, compare the swap's</p><p class="depth0">fixed-leg coupon rate to the Enterprise Cost of Funds with a</p><p class="depth0">maturity equivalent to the maturity date of the swap.2. If the option is a Call, it is deemed to be exercisable at the</p><p class="depth0">discretion of the Enterprise. If the option is a Put, it is</p><p class="depth0">deemed to be exercisable at the discretion of the</p><p class="depth0">Counterparty. If the option is a PutCall, it is deemed to be</p><p class="depth0">exercisable at the discretion of either party to the swap.</p><p class="depth0">Exercise the option when the swap is out of the money for the</p><p class="depth0">party who holds the option. A swap is considered out of the</p><p class="depth0">money when the rate on its fixed leg is at least 50 basis</p><p class="depth0">point higher or lower, depending upon whether the fixed rate</p><p class="depth0">is paid or received, than the like-maturity Enterprise Cost of</p><p class="depth0">Funds. For zero coupon swaps in all option exercise periods,</p><p class="depth0">use the yield to maturity calculated by equating the notional</p><p class="depth0">amount plus the unamortized discount at the start of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test to the present value of the notional amount at</p><p class="depth0">maturity.</p><p class="depth0">a. For example, if the Enterprise holds a call option for a fixed-pay swap and the coupon rate on the fixed-pay leg is at least 50 basis points above the Enterprise cost of funds for a maturity equivalent to that of the swap, then cancel the swap. Otherwise, the swap is not cancelled and it is evaluated the next time that the swap can be cancelled.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.8 Calculate Monthly Interest Accruals for the Life of the</p><p class="depth0">Instrument</p><p class="depth0">[a] Monthly interest accruals are calculated by prorating the interest cash flows on an actual-day basis. In this section, the term ``from'' means from and including, ``to'' means up to and not including, and ``through'' means up to and including. As an example, from the first to the third of a month is two days from the first through the third is three days. This convention is used to facilitate the day count and does not imply on which day's payments or accruals are actually made. Use one of the three following methodologies with the exception

that interest cash flow dates occurring on or after the 30th of a month are considered as occurring on the last day of the month:1. If the final interest cash flow occurs within the month, the interest</p><p class="depth0">accrual for that month is calculated by multiplying the final</p><p class="depth0">interest cash flow amount (as calculated in section 3.8.3.6 of</p><p class="depth0">this appendix) times the number of days from the beginning of</p><p class="depth0">the month through the final maturity date divided by the</p><p class="depth0">number of days from the previous interest cash flow date to</p><p class="depth0">the maturity date.2. If an interest cash flow other than the final interest cash flow</p><p class="depth0">occurs within a month, the interest accrual for that month is</p><p class="depth0">determined by multiplying the interest cash flow amount for</p><p class="depth0">the current month times the number of days from the beginning</p><p class="depth0">of the month through the interest cash flow date, divided by</p><p class="depth0">the number of days from the previous interest cash flow date</p><p class="depth0">(or issue date) to this interest cash flow date. To this add</p><p class="depth0">the interest cash flow amount for the next interest cash flow</p><p class="depth0">date times the number of days from the current month's</p><p class="depth0">interest cash flow date to the end of the month, divided by</p><p class="depth0">the number of days from the current month's interest cash flow</p><p class="depth0">date to the following next interest cash flow date.3. If no interest cash flows occur during a month other than the issue</p><p class="depth0">month, the monthly interest accrual is calculated by</p><p class="depth0">multiplying the next interest cash flow amount times the</p><p class="depth0">number of days in the month divided by the number of days from</p><p class="depth0">the previous interest cash flow date to the next interest cash</p><p class="depth0">flow date.4. If the issue month occurs after the start of the Stress Test, the</p><p class="depth0">monthly interest accrual is calculated by multiplying the next</p><p class="depth0">interest cash flow amount by the number of days in the month</p><p class="depth0">minus the day of issue, divided by the number of days from the</p><p class="depth0">issue date to the next interest cash flow date.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.3.9 Calculate Monthly Amortization (Accretion) of Premiums</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Discounts)</em> and Fees</p><p class="depth0">[a] Adjust monthly interest accruals (see section 3.10.3.6.1[a]3., of this appendix) to reflect the value over time of discounts, premiums, fees and hedging gains and losses incurred (Deferred Balances).

Haircut (i.e., reduced) by a percentage to account for the risk of counterparty insolvency, if a counterparty obligation exists. The amount of the Haircut is calculated based on the public rating of the counterparty and time during the stress period in which the cash flow occurs, as specified in section 3.5, Counterparty Defaults, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[b] An Enterprise may issue debt denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, and eliminate the resulting foreign currency exposure by entering into currency swap agreements. The combination of the debt and the swap creates synthetic debt with principal and interest payments denominated in U.S. dollars. The Haircuts for currency swaps are applied to the pay (dollar-denominated) side of the currency swaps, or to the cash outflows of the synthetic debt instrument. Therefore, the payments made by the Enterprise on a foreign currency contract are increased by the haircut amount. The Haircuts and the Phase-in periods for currency swaps are detailed in Table 3-31, under Derivative Contracts.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Haircuts for swaps that are not foreign currency related are applied to the Monthly Interest Accruals (as calculated in section 3.8.3.8, of this appendix) on the receive leg minus the Monthly Interest Accruals on the pay leg when this difference is positive. Use the maximum haircut from Table 3-31 for periods before and after the implementation of netting, as appropriate. After the implementation of netting, net the swap proceeds for each counterparty before applying the haircuts. The following example applies to an Enterprise having two swaps with the same counterparty. On the first swap, the Enterprise pays fixed and receives floating and on the second swap it pays floating and receives fixed. If the counterparty is a net payer to the Enterprise, the haircuts will be applied to the sum of the two receive legs net of the sum of the two pay legs.</p><p class="depth0">3.8.4 Nonmortgage Instrument Outputs</p><p class="depth0">[a] Outputs consist of cash flows and accounting information for debt, nonmortgage investments, preferred stock, and derivative contracts.

These calculations are determined by, and also affect, the pro forma balance sheets and income statements during the Stress Period.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.1 New Debt and Investments</p><p class="depth0">[a] For each month of the Stress Test, cash deficits and surpluses are eliminated by issuing new debt or purchasing new investments. The Stress Test calculates cash received and cash disbursed each month in order to determine the net availability of cash. Depending on the calculated net cash position at month end, new short term investments are purchased at mid-month or a mix of long and short term debt is issued at mid-month so that the recalculated net cash position at month end is zero.</p><p class="depth0">[b] For each month of the Stress Test, the following calculations are performed to determine the amount and type of new debt and investments. The short-term investments and appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt are reflected in the pro forma balance sheets. Interest income or interest expense for the new investments or debt are reflected in the pro forma income statements.1. In any month in which the cash position is positive at the end of the</p><p class="depth0">month, the Stress Test invests the Enterprise's excess cash on</p><p class="depth0">the 15th day of that month in one-month Treasury bills that</p><p class="depth0">yield the six-month Treasury rate for that month as specified</p><p class="depth0">in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix.2. In any month in which the cash position is negative at the end of the</p><p class="depth0">month, the Stress Test issues a mix of new short-term and</p><p class="depth0">long-term debt on the 15th day of that month. New short-term</p><p class="depth0">debt issued is six-month discount notes with a</p><p class="depth0">discount rate at the six-month Enterprise Cost of Funds as</p><p class="depth0">specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix,</p><p class="depth0">with interest accruing on a 30/360 basis. New long-term debt</p><p class="depth0">issued is five-year bonds not callable for the first year</p><p class="depth0">(``five-year-no call-one'') with an American call at par after</p><p class="depth0">the end of the first year, semiannual coupons on a 30/360</p><p class="depth0">basis with principal paid at maturity or call, and a coupon</p><p class="depth0">rate set at the five year Enterprise Cost of Funds as</p><p class="depth0">specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix,</p><p class="depth0">plus a 50 basis point premium for the call option. During the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test, the call option for new long-term debt issued is</p><p class="depth0">not executed in the up-rate scenario and in the down-rate</p><p class="depth0">scenario follows the same call exercise rule as other debt. An</p><p class="depth0">issuance cost of 2.5 basis points is assessed on new short-</p><p class="depth0">term debt at issue and an issuance cost of 20 basis points is</p><p class="depth0">assessed on new long-term debt at issue. New long-term debt is</p><p class="depth0">issued to target a total debt mix of short- to long-term debt</p><p class="depth0">that is the same as the short- to long-term debt mix at the</p><p class="depth0">beginning of the Stress Test.

Dividends are decided upon and paid during the first month after the end of the quarter for which they are declared. If any dividends are paid, the dividend payout cannot exceed an amount equal to core capital less the estimated minimum capital requirement at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases are made during the middle month of the quarter.1. Preferred Stock. An Enterprise will pay dividends on preferred stock</p><p class="depth0">as long as that Enterprise meets the estimated minimum capital</p><p class="depth0">requirement before and after the payment of these dividends.</p><p class="depth0">Preferred stock dividends are based on the coupon rates of the</p><p class="depth0">issues outstanding. The coupon rates for any issues of</p><p class="depth0">variable rate preferred stock are calculated using projections</p><p class="depth0">of the appropriate index rate. Preferred stock dividends may</p><p class="depth0">not exceed core capital less the estimated minimum capital</p><p class="depth0">requirement at the end of the preceding quarter.2. Common Stock. In the first year of the Stress Test, dividends are</p><p class="depth0">paid on common stock in each of the four quarters after</p><p class="depth0">preferred dividends, if any, are paid unless the Enterprise's</p><p class="depth0">capital is, or after the payment, would be, below the</p><p class="depth0">estimated minimum capital requirement.</p><p class="depth0">a. First Quarter. In the first quarter, the dividend is the dividend per share ratio for common stock from the quarter preceding the Stress Test times the current number of shares of common stock outstanding.</p><p class="depth0">b. Subsequent Quarters.</p><p class="depth0">1) In the three subsequent quarters, if the preceding quarter's after tax income is greater than after tax income in the quarter preceding the Stress Test, (adjusted by the ratio of the Enterprise's retained earnings and retained earnings after adjustments are made that revert investment securities and derivatives to amortized cost), pay the larger of (1) the dividend per share ratio for common stock from the quarter preceding the Stress Test times the current number of shares of common stock outstanding or (2) the average dividend payout ratio for common stock for the four quarters preceding the start of the Stress Test times the preceding quarter's after tax income (adjusted by the reciprocal of the ratio of the Enterprise's retained earnings and retained earnings after adjustments are made that revert investment securities and derivatives to amortized cost) less preferred dividends paid in the current quarter. In no case may the dividend payment exceed an amount equal to core capital less the estimated minimum capital requirement at the end of the preceding quarter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the previous quarter's after tax income is less than or equal to after tax income in the quarter preceding the Stress Test (adjusted by the ratio of the Enterprise's retained earnings and retained earnings after adjustments are made that revert investment securities and derivatives to amortized cost), pay the lesser of (1) the dividend per share ratio for common stock for the quarter preceding the Stress Test times the current number of shares of common stock outstanding or (2) an amount equal to core capital less the estimated minimum capital requirement at the end of the preceding quarter, but not less than zero.3. Share Repurchases. In the first two quarters of the Stress Test, the</p><p class="depth0">capital of the Enterprises will be reduced to reflect the</p><p class="depth0">repurchase of shares. The amount of the capital reduction in</p><p class="depth0">each of those two quarters will be equal to the average net</p><p class="depth0">stock repurchases by the Enterprise during the four quarters</p><p class="depth0">preceding the start of the Stress Period. Net stock</p><p class="depth0">repurchases equal repurchases less receipts from new stock</p><p class="depth0">issued, but not less than zero. Repurchases in each of the</p><p class="depth0">first two quarters may occur only up to the point that the</p><p class="depth0">amount of core capital exceeds the estimated minimum capital</p><p class="depth0">requirement at the end of the first month of the quarter.4. Minimum Capital Requirements. For the purposes of the Stress Test,</p><p class="depth0">the Enterprise's minimum capital requirement is computed by</p><p class="depth0">applying leverage ratios to all assets (2.50 percent) and off-</p><p class="depth0">balance sheet obligations (0.45 percent), and summing the</p><p class="depth0">results. Repurchases of an Enterprise's own previously-issued</p><p class="depth0">MBSs are excluded from the minimum capital calculation used in</p><p class="depth0">section 3.10.3.2, Dividends and Share Repurchases, of this</p><p class="depth0">appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.3 Allowances for Loan Losses and Other Charge-Offs</p><p class="depth0">[a] The Stress Test calculates a tentative allowance for loan losses monthly by multiplying current-month Credit Losses (CL in Table 3-52) by twelve, thus annualizing current month Credit Losses. This is a proxy for a loss contingency where it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For both the retained and sold portfolios, these credit losses include lost principal (net of recoveries from credit enhancements and disposition of the real estate collateral), and foreclosure, holding, and disposition costs. If the tentative allowance for loan losses for the current period is greater than the balance from the prior month less charge-offs (i.e., credit losses) for the current month, a provision (i.e., expense) is recorded. Otherwise, no provision is made and the allowance for loan losses is equal to the prior period amount less current month charge-offs.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Other charge-offs result from Haircuts related to mortgage revenue bonds, private-issue MBS, and non mortgage investments, described in their respective cash flow components.1. In the case of Enterprise investments in securities, these Haircuts</p><p class="depth0">result in the receipt of less principal and interest than is</p><p class="depth0">contractually due. Lost principal is recorded as Other Losses</p><p class="depth0">when due and not received, while lost interest is recorded as</p><p class="depth0">a reduction of Interest Income.2. In the case of interest rate derivative instruments, these Haircuts</p><p class="depth0">result in the receipt of less net interest than is</p><p class="depth0">contractually due from, or the payment of more interest than</p><p class="depth0">is contractually due to, an Enterprise counterparty. For those</p><p class="depth0">swaps that are linked to Enterprise investments, the increase</p><p class="depth0">or decrease of net swap interest due is recorded as an</p><p class="depth0">adjustment of Interest Income. For those swaps that are linked</p><p class="depth0">to Enterprise debt obligations, the increase or decrease of</p><p class="depth0">net swap interest due is recorded as an adjustment of Interest</p><p class="depth0">Expense.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.4 Operating Expenses</p><p class="depth0">[a] The Stress Test calculates operating expenses, which include non-interest costs such as those related to an Enterprise's salaries and benefits, professional services, property, equipment and office space. Over the Stress Period, operating expenses are equal to the sum of two components. The first component in each month is equal to one-third (\1/3\) of the average monthly operating expenses of the Enterprise in the quarter immediately preceding the start of the Stress Test. The second component changes in proportion to the change in the size of the Enterprise's mortgage portfolio (i.e., the sum of outstanding principal balances of its retained and sold mortgage portfolios). The Stress Test calculates the Enterprise's mortgage portfolio at the end of each month of the Stress Period as a percentage of the portfolio at the start of the Stress Test, and then multiplies the percentage of assets remaining by two-thirds (\2/3\) of the average monthly operating expenses of the Enterprise in the quarter immediately preceding the start of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">[b] The sum of the two components in paragraph [a], of this section, is multiplied by a factor which equals[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13SE01.124
for the first 12 months of the Stress Test and then equals two-thirds for months 13 and beyond. This product is the Enterprise's operating expense for a given month in the Stress Period.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.5 Income Taxes</p><p class="depth0">[a] Both Enterprises are subject to Federal income taxes, but neither is subject to state or local income taxes.</p><p class="depth0">[b] The Stress Test applies an effective Federal income tax rate of 30 percent when calculating the monthly provision for income taxes (e.g., income tax expense). OFHEO may change the 30 percent income tax rate if there are significant changes in Enterprise experience or changes in the statutory income tax.</p><p class="depth0">[c] The Stress Test sets income tax expense for tax purposes equal to the provision for income taxes. The effects of timing differences between taxable income and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

(GAAP) income before income taxes are ignored. Income before taxes is adjusted by the ratio of Enterprise retained earnings and retained earnings after adjustments are made that revert investment securities and derivatives to amortized cost. Therefore, Net Operating Loss (NOL) occurs only when the net income, before the provision for income taxes, is negative.</p><p class="depth0">[d] Payments for estimated income taxes are made quarterly, in the month after the end of the quarter. At the end of each year, the annual estimated tax amount is compared to the annual actual tax amount. In March of the next year, a payment of remaining taxes is made or a refund for overpayment of income taxes is received.</p><p class="depth0">[e] The NOL for the current year is ``carried back'' to offset taxes in any or all of the preceding two calendar years. (The Enterprises' tax year is the same as the calendar year.) This offset of the prior years' taxes results in a negative provision for income taxes (e.g., income) for the current year. Use of a carry back reduces available carry backs in subsequent years. Any NOL remaining after carry backs are exhausted becomes a carry forward.</p><p class="depth0">[f] Carry forwards represent NOLs that cannot be carried back to offset previous years' taxes, but can be used to offset taxes in any or all of the subsequent 20 years. Carry forwards accumulate until used, or until they expire 20 years after they are generated.</p><p class="depth0">[g] A valuation adjustment is used to eliminate any deferred tax asset.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.6 Accounting</p><p class="depth0">[a] The 1992 Act specifies that total capital includes core capital and a general allowance for foreclosure losses. For the Enterprises, this general allowance is represented by general allowances for loan losses on their retained and sold mortgage portfolios. As defined at 12 CFR 1750.2, core capital includes the sum of the following components of equity:1. The par or stated value of outstanding common stock,2. The par or stated value of outstanding perpetual, noncumulative</p><p class="depth0">preferred stock,3. Paid-in capital, and4. Retained earnings.</p><p class="depth0">[b] In order to determine the amount of total capital an Enterprise must hold to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period, the Stress Test projects the four components of equity listed in paragraph [a] of this section plus general loss allowances as part of the monthly pro forma balance sheets.</p><p class="depth0">[c] Details of an Enterprise's actual balance sheet at the beginning of the Stress Test are recorded from a combination of starting position balances for all instruments for which other components of the Stress Test calculate cash flows and other starting position balances for assets, liabilities, and equity accounts needed to complete an Enterprise's balance sheet.</p><p class="depth0">[d] After recording an Enterprise's balance sheet at the beginning of the Stress Period, the Stress Test creates monthly pro forma balance sheets and income statements by recording output from the cash flow components of the Stress Test; recording new debt and investments (and related interest), dividends, loss allowances, operating expenses, and taxes; and applying accounting rules pertaining to pro forma balance sheets and income statements.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.6.1 Accounting for Cash Flows and Accounting Flows</p><p class="depth0">[a] Balances at the beginning of the Stress Test are obtained from the RBC Report. Subsequent changes to related pro forma balance sheet and income statement accounts are obtained from data generated by cash flow components of the Stress Test as follows:1. Retained Loans. For Retained Loans, interest cash flows in the first</p><p class="depth0">month of the Stress Period reduce accrued interest receivable</p><p class="depth0">at the beginning of the Stress Test. Subsequent months</p><p class="depth0">interest cash flows are recorded as accrued interest</p><p class="depth0">receivable and interest income in the month prior to receipt.</p><p class="depth0">When the interest cash flows are received, accrued interest</p><p class="depth0">receivable is reduced. Monthly principal cash flows (including</p><p class="depth0">Prepayments and defaulted principal) are recorded as</p><p class="depth0">reductions in the outstanding balance of the loan group. Net</p><p class="depth0">losses on Defaults are charged off against the allowance for</p><p class="depth0">loan losses. Amortization of deferred discounts increases</p><p class="depth0">interest income; amortization of deferred premiums decreases</p><p class="depth0">interest income.2. Mortgage Revenue Bonds. For mortgage revenue bonds, interest cash</p><p class="depth0">flows in the first month of the Stress Period reduce accrued</p><p class="depth0">interest receivable at the beginning of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">Subsequent months' interest cash flows are recorded as accrued</p><p class="depth0">interest receivable and interest income in the month prior to</p><p class="depth0">receipt. When the interest cash flows are received, accrued</p><p class="depth0">interest receivable is reduced. Monthly principal cash flows</p><p class="depth0">(including Prepayments) are recorded in the month received as</p><p class="depth0">a reduction in the outstanding balance of mortgage assets.</p><p class="depth0">Defaulted principal is charged off when due and is not</p><p class="depth0">received. Amortization of deferred discounts increases</p><p class="depth0">interest income; amortization of deferred premiums decreases</p><p class="depth0">interest income.3. Nonmortgage Instruments. Principal repayments of nonmortgage</p><p class="depth0">instruments reduce the nonmortgage instrument and</p><p class="depth0">increases or decreases cash. When the interest cash flows are</p><p class="depth0">received or paid, accrued interest receivable or payable is</p><p class="depth0">reduced. Accrued interest includes both amounts at the</p><p class="depth0">beginning of the Stress Period and subsequent monthly accruals</p><p class="depth0">(also recorded as interest income or interest expense).</p><p class="depth0">Amortization of deferred discounts and premiums increases or</p><p class="depth0">decreases interest income or interest expense. Defaulted</p><p class="depth0">principal is charged off when due and not received.4. Sold Portfolio. Sold portfolio cash flows include monthly guarantee</p><p class="depth0">fees, float, and principal and interest due MBS investors.</p><p class="depth0">Guarantee fees are recorded as income in the month received.</p><p class="depth0">Principal and interest due mortgage security investors does</p><p class="depth0">not affect the balance sheet; however, interest earned on</p><p class="depth0">these amounts (float) is recorded as income in the month the</p><p class="depth0">underlying principal and interest payments are received.</p><p class="depth0">Principal payments received and defaulted loan balances reduce</p><p class="depth0">the outstanding balance of the sold portfolio. Losses (net of</p><p class="depth0">recoveries) are charged off against the allowance for losses</p><p class="depth0">on the sold portfolio (a liability on the pro forma balance</p><p class="depth0">sheets) and reduce cash. Amortization of deferred premiums and</p><p class="depth0">discounts increases or decreases guarantee fees.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.6.2 Accounting for Non-Cash Items</p><p class="depth0">[a] Changes in the pro forma balances for other parts of the Enterprise's balance sheet not resulting from cash flows are recorded as described in the following nine steps:1.

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Investments. Low income housing tax</p><p class="depth0">credit investments at the beginning of the Stress Test are</p><p class="depth0">converted to cash on a straight line basis over the first six</p><p class="depth0">months of the Stress Period.3. Other Assets. The following other assets at the beginning of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test are converted to cash as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Clearing accounts and other miscellaneous receivables (e.g., fees receivable, accounts receivable, and other miscellaneous assets) in the first month of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">b. Earning assets (see section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix)</p><p class="depth0">c. Items not covered by a. and b. of this section on a straight-line basis over the first five-years of the Stress Test.4. Real Estate Owned (REO). Real estate owned at the beginning of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test is converted to cash on a straight-line basis over</p><p class="depth0">the first six months of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">5. Fixed Assets. 25 percent of fixed assets (net of accumulated depreciation) as of the beginning of the Stress Test remain constant over the Stress Test. The remaining 75 percent is converted to cash on a straight line basis over the ten-year Stress Period. Depreciation is included in the base on which operating expenses are calculated for each month during the Stress Period.6. Principal and Interest Payable. Principal and interest payable to an</p><p class="depth0">Enterprise's mortgage security investors at the beginning of</p><p class="depth0">the Stress Test are paid during the first two months of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test (one-half in month one and one-half in month two).7. Other Liabilities. The following liabilities at the beginning of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test are paid in the first month of the Stress Test,</p><p class="depth0">reducing cash:</p><p class="depth0">a. Escrow deposits</p><p class="depth0">b. Other miscellaneous liabilities8. Commitments. No gains or losses are recorded when commitments are</p><p class="depth0">added to the Enterprise's sold portfolio. See section 3.2.1,</p><p class="depth0">of this appendix.9. Fully-Hedged Foreign Currency-Denominated Liabilities. Amounts that</p><p class="depth0">relate to currency swaps and foreign currency-denominated</p><p class="depth0">liabilities will be treated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Recorded balances that correspond to converted foreign currency-denominated liabilities will be amortized in a manner that is consistent with scheduled pay leg exchanges of notional amounts as set forth in corresponding currency swaps. The unamortized premiums, discounts and/or fees that are associated with these liabilities will be amortized as described in section 3.8, of this appendix, as if they were associated with the pay legs of the corresponding currency swap. Any differences will be reflected as an increase or decrease in Retained Earnings.</p><p class="depth0">b. Interest payable amounts associated with currency swaps will be settled in a manner that is consistent with the contractual terms for these instruments.</p><p class="depth0">c. Receivable amounts associated with currency swaps and interest payable amounts associated with foreign currency-denominated debt will be reversed against Retained Earnings.</p><p class="depth0">d. The adjustments in a., b. and c., of this section, will take place at the start of the Stress Test. These treatments are not applied to instruments that are modeled under AMT (see section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix) or foreign currency-denominated instruments that are not fully hedged.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.6.3 Other Accounting Principles</p><p class="depth0">The following additional accounting principles apply to the pro forma balance sheets and income statements:1. All investment securities are treated as held to maturity. As such,</p><p class="depth0">they are recorded as assets at amortized cost, not at fair</p><p class="depth0">value.2. All non-securitized mortgage loans will be classified as ``held-to-</p><p class="depth0">maturity'' and will be accounted for on an amortized cost</p><p class="depth0">basis.3. Effective control over the collateral for collateral financings is</p><p class="depth0">with the party that originally delivered such collateral.4. Enterprise Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) subsidiaries are</p><p class="depth0">consolidated. Specifically, REIT assets are treated as</p><p class="depth0">Enterprise assets. Preferred stock of the REIT is reflected as</p><p class="depth0">Enterprise debt. Dividends paid on the preferred stock are</p><p class="depth0">reported as interest expense.5. Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction in retained earnings.</p><p class="depth0">3.10.4 Operations, Taxes, and Accounting Outputs</p><p class="depth0">For each month of the Stress Period, the Stress Test produces a pro forma balance sheet and income statement. The Operations, Taxes and Accounting component outputs 121 monthly and 11 annual balance sheets, 120 monthly and 10 annual income statements, and 120 monthly and 10 annual cash flow statements, including part-year statements for the first and last calendar years of the Stress Test when necessary. These pro forma financial statements are the inputs for calculation of the risk-based capital requirement (see section 3.12, Calculation of the Risk-Based Capital Requirement, of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">3.11 Treatment of New Enterprise Activities</p><p class="depth0">3.11.1 New Enterprise Activities Overview</p><p class="depth0">[a] Given rapid innovation in the financial services industry, OFHEO anticipates the Enterprises will become involved with new mortgage products, investments, debt and derivative instruments, and business activities, which must be accommodated in the Stress Test in order to capture all of the risk in the Enterprises' businesses. New accounting entries resulting from these innovations and changes in accounting must also be accommodated. The regulation is sufficiently flexible and complete to address new Enterprise activities as they emerge, using the procedures outlined in this section. However, OFHEO will monitor the Enterprises' activities and, when appropriate, propose amendments to this regulation addressing the treatment of new instruments, activities, or accounting treatments.</p><p class="depth0">[b] For the purpose of this section of the appendix, the term New Activity means any type of asset, liability, off-balance-sheet item, accounting entry, or activity to which a Stress Test treatment has not previously been applied. In addition, the Director has the discretion to treat as a New Activity: (1) any activity or instrument with characteristics or unusual features that create risks or hedges for the Enterprise that are not reflected adequately in the specified treatments for similar activities or instruments; and (2) any activity or instrument for which the specified treatment no longer adequately reflects the risk/benefit to the Enterprise, either because of increased volume or because new information concerning those risks/hedges has become available.</p><p class="depth0">3.11.2 New Enterprise Activities Inputs</p><p class="depth0">[a] Complete data and full explanations of the operation of the New Activity sufficient to understand the risk profile of the New Activity must be provided by the Enterprise. The Enterprises are required to notify OFHEO, pursuant to Sec. 1750.12(c), of proposals related to New Activities as soon as possible, but in any event no later than five calendar days after the date on which the transaction closes or is settled. The Enterprises are encouraged to suggest an appropriate capital treatment that will fully capture the credit and interest rate risk in the New Activity. Information on New Activities must also be

submitted and appropriately identified as such in the RBC Report.</p><p class="depth0">[b] The Stress Test will not give an Enterprise the capital benefit associated with a New Activity where OFHEO determines that the impact of that activity on the risk-based capital level of the Enterprise is not commensurate with the economic benefit to the Enterprise.</p><p class="depth0">3.11.3 New Enterprise Activities Procedures</p><p class="depth0">[a] OFHEO will analyze the risk characteristics and determine whether an existing approach specified in the appendix appropriately captures the risk of the New Activity or whether some combination or adaptation of existing approaches specified in the appendix is appropriate. For example, the Stress Test might employ its mortgage performance components and adapt its cash flow components to simulate accurately the loss mitigating effects and counterparty credit risk of credit derivatives.</p><p class="depth0">[b] Where there is no reasonable approach using existing combinations or adaptations of treatments specified in this appendix that could be applied within the timeframe for computing a quarterly capital calculation, the Stress Test will employ an appropriately conservative treatment, consistent with OFHEO's role as a safety and soundness regulator. Such treatment may include an alternative modeling treatment specified in section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix, or some other conservative treatment that OFHEO deems more appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">[c] OFHEO will provide the Enterprise with its estimate of the capital treatment as soon as possible after receiving notice of the New Activity. In any event, the Enterprise will be notified of the capital treatment in accordance with the notice of proposed capital classification provided for in Sec. 1777.21 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">[d] After a treatment has been incorporated into a final capital classification, OFHEO will provide notice of such treatment to the public, including the other Enterprise. OFHEO will consider any comments it receives from the public regarding the treatment during subsequent quarters. OFHEO may change the treatment as a result of such input or otherwise, if OFHEO determines that the risks of the New Activity are not appropriately reflected in a treatment previously adopted.</p><p class="depth0">3.11.4 New Enterprise Activities Outputs</p><p class="depth0">The Stress Test will generate a set of cash and/or accounting flows reflecting the treatment applied to the New Activity.</p><p class="depth0">3.12 Calculation of the Risk-Based Capital Requirement</p><p class="depth0">3.12.1 Risk-Based Capital Requirement Overview</p><p class="depth0">The risk-based capital requirement is the sum of (1) the minimum amount of total capital that an Enterprise must hold at the start of the Stress Test in order to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period, for all financial instruments explicitly modeled in the Stress Test (Stress Test capital subtotal) and (2) certain additional amounts relating to off-balance-sheet items addressed in section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix, and (3) 30 percent of that sum for management and operations risk. The Stress Test capital subtotal is determined based on monthly total capital figures from the pro forma financial statements, the additional amounts related to off-balance-sheet items, and Enterprise short term borrowing and investment rates.</p><p class="depth0">3.12.2 Risk-Based Capital Requirement Inputs</p><p class="depth0">[a] Inputs to the capital calculation are outputs from section 3.3, Interest Rates, section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, and section 3.10, Operations, Taxes, and Accounting, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[b] For each month of the Stress Test, the following inputs are from, or used in the creation of, pro forma financial statements projected in section 3.10, Operations, Taxes, and Accounting, of this appendix:
1. Total capital</p><p class="depth0">a. The par or stated value of outstanding common stock,</p><p class="depth0">b. The par or stated value of outstanding perpetual, noncumulative preferred stock,</p><p class="depth0">c. Paid-in capital,</p><p class="depth0">d. retained earnings, and</p><p class="depth0">e. allowance for losses on retained and sold mortgages less specific losses calculated in accordance with FAS 114,2. Provision for income taxes (income tax expense),3. Valuation adjustment that reduces benefits recorded from net</p><p class="depth0">operating losses when no net operating loss tax carrybacks are</p><p class="depth0">available, and4. An Enterprise's cash position prior to the decision to issue new debt</p><p class="depth0">or purchase new investments to balance the balance sheet (see</p><p class="depth0">section 3.10.3.1, New Debt and Investments, of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0">[c] For present-value calculations, the Stress Test uses the six-month Enterprise Cost of Funds or the six-month CMT yield as described in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">[d] The amount for off-balance-sheet items that are not explicitly modeled is obtained

from section 3.9.3.1, Off-Balance Sheet Items, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.12.3 Risk-Based Capital Requirement Procedures</p><p class="depth0">[a] The following eight steps are used to determine the Stress Test capital subtotal and the risk-based capital requirement for an Enterprise:1. Determine the effective tax rate in each month. If the provision for</p><p class="depth0">income taxes is positive (reflecting taxes owed) or negative</p><p class="depth0">(reflecting tax refunds to be received), then the effective</p><p class="depth0">tax rate is 30 percent. If the provision for income taxes is</p><p class="depth0">zero after applying any valuation adjustments (see section</p><p class="depth0">3.10.3.6, Accounting, of this appendix), then the effective</p><p class="depth0">tax rate applied in step 3. of this section is zero.2. Determine whether an Enterprise is an investor or a borrower in each</p><p class="depth0">month of the Stress Period. In months where an Enterprise has</p><p class="depth0">outstanding six-month discount notes that were issued during</p><p class="depth0">the stress test, then the Enterprise is a borrower. Otherwise,</p><p class="depth0">the Enterprise is an investor.3. Determine the appropriate monthly discount factor for each month of</p><p class="depth0">the Stress Period:</p><p class="depth0">a. In months where an Enterprise is an investor, the monthly discount</p><p class="depth0">factor is based on the yield of short-term assets:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13SE01.125</p><p class="depth0">b. In months where an Enterprise is a borrower, the monthly discount</p><p class="depth0">factor is based on the cost of the Enterprise's short-term</p><p class="depth0">debt:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13SE01.126</p><p class="depth0">Where:
0.00025 is the factor that incorporates the issuance and administrative</p><p class="depth0">costs for an Enterprise's new discount notes.
4. Compute the appropriate cumulative discount for each month of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Period. The cumulative discount factor for a given</p><p class="depth0">month is the monthly discount factor for that month multiplied</p><p class="depth0">by the cumulative discount factor for the preceding month.</p><p class="depth0">(The cumulative discount factor for the first month of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Period is the monthly discount factor for that month.)</p><p class="depth0">Thus, the cumulative discount factor for any month</p><p class="depth0">incorporates all of the previous monthly discount factors.5. Discount total capital for each month of the Stress Period to the</p><p class="depth0">start of the Stress Period for both interest rate scenarios.</p><p class="depth0">Divide the total capital for a given month by the cumulative</p><p class="depth0">discount factor for that month.6. Identify the Stress Test capital subtotal, which is the lowest</p><p class="depth0">discounted total capital amount from among the 240 monthly</p><p class="depth0">discounted total capital amounts.7. From the Stress Test capital subtotal, subtract the capital required</p><p class="depth0">for off-balance sheet items not explicitly modeled in the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test, as calculated in section 3.9.3.1, Off-Balance</p><p class="depth0">Sheet Items, of this appendix. Then subtract the resulting</p><p class="depth0">difference from the Enterprise's total capital at the start of</p><p class="depth0">the Stress Period. The resulting number is the amount of total</p><p class="depth0">capital that an Enterprise must hold at the start of the</p><p class="depth0">Stress Test in order to maintain positive total capital</p><p class="depth0">throughout the ten-year Stress Period.8. Multiply the minimum total capital amount by 1.3 for management and</p><p class="depth0">operations risk.9. Subtract the net increase (or add the net decrease) in Retained</p><p class="depth0">Earnings related to Fair Value Hedges at the start of the</p><p class="depth0">stress test made in accordance with section 3.10.3.6.2[a]1.b.</p><p class="depth0">of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">3.12.4 Risk-Based Capital Requirement Output</p><p class="depth0">The output of the calculations in this section is the risk-based capital requirement for an Enterprise at the start date of the Stress Test.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Glossary</p><p class="depth0">This glossary is intended to define terms in the Regulatory appendix that are used in a computationally specific sense that require a precise quantitative definition.</p><p class="depth0">A</p><p class="depth0">Accounting Flows: one or more series of numbers tracking various components of the accounting computations over time, analogous to ``Cash Flows.''</p><p class="depth0">Age: of a Mortgage Loan, for computational purpose: the number of scheduled payment dates that have occurred prior to the time at which the Age is determined.
