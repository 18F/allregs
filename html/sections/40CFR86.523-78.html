                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (1)  through (11) of this section.   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.181</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup  and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero grade air or zero  grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Connect the outlet of the NOX generator to the sample  inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most  common operating range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Introduce into the NOX generator analyzer-system a NO  in nitrogen (N2) mixture with a NO concentration equal to  approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The  NO2 content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5 percent  of the NO concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the  concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Turn on the NOX generator O2 (or air)  supply and adjust the O2 (or air) flow rate so that the NO  indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in  step 5. Record the concentration of NO in this NO+O2 mixture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Switch the NOX generator to the generation mode and  adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured on   the analyzer is 20 percent of that measured in step 5. There must be at  least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the concentration of  residual NO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NOX  mode and measure total NOX. Record this value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Switch off the NOX generation but maintain gas flow  through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the  NOX in the NO+O2 mixture. Record this value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Turn off the NOX generator O2 (or air)  supply. The analyzer will now indicate the NOX in the  original NO in N2 mixture. This value should be no more than  5 percent above the value indicated in step 4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Calculate the efficiency of the NOX converter by  substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:  Percent Efficiency = [1 + (a - b)/(c - d)] x 100  where:  a = concentration obtained in step (8). b = concentration obtained in step (9). c = concentration obtained in step (6). d = concentration obtained in step (7).   If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent corrective action  will be required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into  service and monthly thereafter, if oxides of nitrogen are measured, the  chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer shall be calibrated on all  normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate as when  analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero grade air or zero  grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO in  N2 calibration gases with nominal concentrations of 50 and  100 percent of that range. Additional calibration points may be  generated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When testing methanol-fueled motorcycles, it may be necessary to  clean the analyzer frequently to prevent interference with  NOX measurements (see EPA/600/S3-88/040).
