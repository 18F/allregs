                            <p class="depth0">A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 242(a) in an  amount equal to certain interest received on obligations of the United  States, or an obligation of corporations organized under Acts of  Congress which are instrumentalities of the United States. The interest  for which a deduction shall be allowed is interest which is included in  gross income and which is exempt from normal tax under the act, as  amended and supplemented, which authorized the issuance of the  obligations. The deduction allowed by section 242(a) is allowed only for  the purpose of computing normal tax, and therefore, no deduction is  allowed for such interest in the computation of any surtax imposed by  Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  [T.D. 7100, 36 FR 5333, Mar. 20, 1971]</p>
