Such procedures must provide that before a State issues a permit to a source based on a good engineering practice stack height that exceeds the height allowed by Sec. 51.100(ii) (1) or (2), the State must notify the public of the availability of the demonstration study and must provide opportunity for public hearing on it. This section does not require such procedures to restrict in any manner the actual stack height of any source.</p>
