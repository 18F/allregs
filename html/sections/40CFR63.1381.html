                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in Sec.  63.2, or in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means systems that include, but are not limited to, devices using triboelectric, light scattering, and other effects to monitor relative or absolute particulate matter (PM) emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Bonded means wool fiberglass to which a phenol-formaldehyde binder has been applied.</p><p class="depth0">Building insulation means bonded wool fiberglass insulation, having a

loss on ignition of less than 8 percent and a density of less than 32 kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m\3\) (2 pounds per cubic foot [lb/ft\3\]).</p><p class="depth0">Cold top electric furnace means an all-electric glass-melting furnace that operates with a temperature of 120 C (250 F) or less as measured at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface.</p><p class="depth0">Flame attenuation means a process used to produce wool fiberglass where molten glass flows by gravity from melting furnaces, or pots, to form filaments that are drawn down and attenuated by passing in front of a high-velocity gas burner flame.</p><p class="depth0">Glass-melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature, refined, and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations, superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat exchangers, melter cooling system, exhaust system, refractory brick work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and distributing molten glass to forming processes. The forming apparatus, including flow channels, is not considered part of the glass-melting furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Glass pull rate means the mass of molten glass that is produced by a single glass-melting furnace or that is used in the manufacture of wool fiberglass at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) means any air pollutant listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth0">Heavy-density product means bonded wool fiberglass insulation manufactured on a flame attenuation manufacturing line and having a loss on ignition of 11 to 25 percent and a density of 8 to 48 kg/m\3\ (0.5 to 3 lb/ft \3\).</p><p class="depth0">Incinerator means an enclosed air pollution control device that uses controlled flame combustion to convert combustible materials to noncombustible gases.</p><p class="depth0">Loss on ignition (LOI) means the percent decrease in weight of wool fiberglass after it has been ignited. The LOI is used to monitor the weight percent of binder in wool fiberglass.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturing line means the manufacturing equipment for the production of wool fiberglass that consists of a forming section where molten glass is fiberized and a fiberglass mat is formed and which may include a curing section where binder resin in the mat is thermally set and a cooling section where the mat is cooled.</p><p class="depth0">New source means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after March 31, 1997.</p><p class="depth0">Pipe product means bonded wool fiberglass insulation manufactured on a flame attenuation manufacturing line and having a loss on ignition of 8 to 14 percent and a density of 48 to 96 kg/m \3\ (3 to 6 lb/ft\3\).</p><p class="depth0">Rotary spin means a process used to produce wool fiberglass building insulation by forcing molten glass through numerous small orifices in the side wall of a spinner to form continuous glass fibers that are then broken into discrete lengths by high-velocity air flow. Any process used to produce bonded wool fiberglass building insulation by a process other than flame attenuation is considered rotary spin.</p><p class="depth0">Wool fiberglass means insulation materials composed of glass fibers made from glass produced or melted at the same facility where the manufacturing line is located.</p><p class="depth0">Wool fiberglass manufacturing facility means any facility manufacturing wool fiberglass on a rotary spin manufacturing line or on a flame attenuation manufacturing line.</p>
