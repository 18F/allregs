The  emission limits are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block  by up to and including 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be  attenuated below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 116  Log10(f/6.1) decibels or 50 + 10 Log10(P) decibels  or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation, where f is the  frequency removed from the center of the outer channel in the block in  kilohertz and where f is greater than 12.5 kHz.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any frequency removed from the EA licensee's frequency block  greater than 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated  below the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 43 +  10Log10(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser  attenuation, where f is the frequency removed from the center of the  outer channel in the block in kilohertz and where f is greater than 37.5  kHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes  harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require  greater attenuation than specified in this section.</p>
