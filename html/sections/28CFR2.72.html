                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the initial hearing the examiner shall review with the prisoner the guidelines at Sec.  2.80, and shall discuss with the prisoner such information as the examiner deems relevant, including the prisoner's offense behavior, criminal history, institutional record, health status, release plans, and community support. If the examiner determines that the available file material is not adequate for this purpose the examiner may order the hearing to be postponed to the next docket so that the missing information can be requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A prisoner may have a representative at the hearing pursuant to Sec.  2.13(b) and the opportunity for prehearing disclosure of file material pursuant to Sec.  2.55.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A victim of a crime, or a representative of the immediate family of a victim if the victim has died, shall have the right:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To be present at the parole hearings of each offender who committed the crime, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To testify and/or offer a written or recorded statement as to whether or not parole should be granted, including information and reasons in support of such statement. A written statement may be submitted at the hearing or provided separately. The prisoner may be excluded from the hearing room during the appearance of a victim or representative who gives testimony. In lieu of appearing at a parole hearing, a victim or representative may request permission to appear before an examiner (or other staff member), who shall record and summarize the victim's or representative's testimony. Whenever new and significant information is provided under this rule, the hearing examiner will summarize the information at the parole hearing and will give the prisoner an opportunity to respond. Such summary shall be consistent with a reasonable request for confidentiality by the victim or representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Attorneys, family members, relatives, friends of the prisoner, or other interested persons desiring to submit information pertinent to any prisoner, may do so at any time, but such information must be received by the Commission at least 30 days prior to a scheduled hearing in order to be considered at that hearing. Such persons may also request permission to appear at the offices of the Commission to speak to a Commission staff member, provided such request is received at least 30 days prior to the scheduled hearing. The purpose of this office visit will be to supplement the Commission's record with pertinent factual information concerning the prisoner, which shall be placed in the record for consideration at the hearing. An office visit at a time other than set forth in this paragraph may be authorized only if the Commission finds good cause based upon a written request setting forth the nature of the information to be discussed. See Sec.  2.22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A full and complete recording of every parole hearing shall be retained by the Commission. Upon a request pursuant to Sec.  2.56, the Commission shall make available to any eligible prisoner such record as the Commission has retained of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Because parole decisions must be reached through a record-based hearing and voting process, no contacts shall be permitted between any person attempting to influence the Commission's decision-making process, and the examiners and Commissioners of the Commission, except as expressly provided in this subpart.
