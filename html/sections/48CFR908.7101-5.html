                            <p class="depth0">Normally, DOE does not purchase or authorize contractors to purchase  used vehicles. However, the Heads of Contracting Activities may  authorize the purchase of used vehicles where justified by special  circumstances; e.g., when new vehicles are in short supply, the vehicles  are to be used for experimental or test purposes, or the vehicles are  acquired from exchange sale. In accordance with 41 CFR 109-26.501-50 and  109-26.501-51, the statutory passenger vehicle allocation requirements  for DOE shall apply to any purchase of used vehicles except in the case  of vehicles to be used exclusively for experimental or test purposes.
