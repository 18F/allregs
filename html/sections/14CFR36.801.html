For those primary, normal, transport, and restricted category helicopters having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more than 7,000 pounds for which compliance with appendix J of this part is demonstrated, the noise generated by the helicopter must be measured at the noise measuring point and under the test conditions prescribed in part B of appendix J of this part, or an FAA-approved equivalent procedure.
