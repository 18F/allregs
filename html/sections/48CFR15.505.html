If the debriefing is delayed until after award, it shall include all information normally provided in a postaward debriefing (see 15.506(d)).

The rationale for delaying the debriefing shall be documented in the contract file. If the contracting officer delays the debriefing, it shall be provided no later than the time postaward debriefings are provided under 15.506. In that event, the contracting officer shall include the information at 15.506(d) in the debriefing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Debriefings may be done orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The contracting officer should normally chair any debriefing session held.
