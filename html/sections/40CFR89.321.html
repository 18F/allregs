Use the same flow rate as when  analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or  zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO-in- N2 calibration gases with nominal concentrations starting at  between 10 and 15 percent and increasing in at least six incremental  steps to 90 percent (e.g., 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent) of that  range. The incremental steps are to be spaced to represent good  engineering practice. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a  least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or less of the value  at each non-zero data point and within [0.3 percent of full scale on the  zero, concentration values may be calculated by use of a single  calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds these  limits, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to  within these limits shall be used to determine concentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The initial and periodic interference, system check, and  calibration test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 may be used in  lieu of the procedures specified in this section.
