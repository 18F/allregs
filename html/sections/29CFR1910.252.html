For elaboration of these basic precautions and of the special precautions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section as well as a delineation of the fire protection and prevention responsibilities of welders and cutters, their supervisors (including outside

contractors) and those in management on whose property cutting and welding is to be performed, see Standard for Fire Prevention in Use of Cutting and Welding Processes, NFPA Standard 51B, 1962, which is incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 1910.6. The basic precautions for fire prevention in welding or cutting work are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fire hazards. If the object to be welded or cut cannot readily be moved, all movable fire hazards in the vicinity shall be taken to a safe place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guards. If the object to be welded or cut cannot be moved and if all the fire hazards cannot be removed, then guards shall be used to confine the heat, sparks, and slag, and to protect the immovable fire hazards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restrictions. If the requirements stated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section cannot be followed then welding and cutting shall not be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special precautions. When the nature of the work to be performed falls within the scope of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section certain additional precautions may be necessary:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Combustible material. Wherever there are floor openings or cracks in the flooring that cannot be closed, precautions shall be taken so that no readily combustible materials on the floor below will be exposed to sparks which might drop through the floor. The same precautions shall be observed with regard to cracks or holes in walls, open doorways and open or broken windows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fire extinquishers. Suitable fire extinguishing equipment shall be maintained in a state of readiness for instant use. Such equipment may consist of pails of water, buckets of sand, hose or portable extinguishers depending upon the nature and quantity of the combustible material exposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fire watch. (A) Fire watchers shall be required whenever welding or cutting is performed in locations where other than a minor fire might develop, or any of the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appreciable combustible material, in building construction or contents, closer than 35 feet (10.7 m) to the point of operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Appreciable combustibles are more than 35 feet (10.7 m) away but are easily ignited by sparks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Wall or floor openings within a 35-foot (10.7 m) radius expose combustible material in adjacent areas including concealed spaces in walls or floors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Combustible materials are adjacent to the opposite side of metal partitions, walls, ceilings, or roofs and are likely to be ignited by conduction or radiation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fire watchers shall have fire extinguishing equipment readily available and be trained in its use. They shall be familiar with facilities for sounding an alarm in the event of a fire. They shall watch for fires in all exposed areas, try to extinguish them only when obviously within the capacity of the equipment available, or otherwise sound the alarm. A fire watch shall be maintained for at least a half hour after completion of welding or cutting operations to detect and extinguish possible smoldering fires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Authorization.
