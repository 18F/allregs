Arrangements have been made between DOD and GSA to implement this law and apply it to excess MCA housing as well as to housing encumbered by mortgage debts such as Capehart and Wherry Housing projects. (See Sec. 644.322(b).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The agreement with GSA calls for separate identification and description in the Report of Excess (SF 118) of those improvements which are considered family housing within the purview of the law and a request in the report that proceeds from disposal be transferred to the DOD Family Housing Management Account. (The actual transfer of funds will be accomplished at Washington level.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the Report of Excess includes both housing and property not related to housing, separate schedules (SF 118 a and b) will be prepared to cover the housing involved, including related land and other improvements. The housing schedules should be annotated and arranged categorically to show:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Number of structures by type of authorization, i.e., Wherry Act, Capehart Act, Military Construction Authorization Act, Lanham Act, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of family units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Those improvements and collateral facilities which are considered ``related'' to the housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where reasonably apparent, a description of the acreage or boundaries of the family housing areas as distinguished from other excess lands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement as follows: ``Net proceeds from the sale of this family housing, including related lands and improvements, shall be remitted to DOD for deposit to Family Housing Management Account, Defense 97X0700.''</p>
