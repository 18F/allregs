We will reduce the  minimum annual production requirements of your lease proportionately for  that time during a lease year in which a suspension of operations and  production is effective. You do not have to pay rental and minimum  annual production royalties starting with the first day of the next  lease month after the suspension becomes effective. However, if the  suspension is effective on the first day of the lease month, you may  stop paying rentals and royalties that same day.</p>
