When an agency fails to withhold some or all of an employee deduction under 5 U.S.C. 8334(a) for any pay period, the agency is still responsible for submitting the correct agency contribution to OPM. The agency must submit as the agency share, a payment equal to the amount that would have been submitted if the error had not been made (or a payment equal to the difference between the amount already submitted as the agency share and the amount that should have been submitted). The payment should be submitted to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions as soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards established by OPM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employee share.

The employee does not have the option to pay a deposit directly to OPM when partial deductions have been withheld.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the agency waives the employee's repayment of the salary overpayment that resulted from the administrative error, the agency must also submit (in addition to the agency contribution) the employee's share of the unpaid contributions to OPM in the manner currently prescribed for the transmission of withholdings and contributions.
