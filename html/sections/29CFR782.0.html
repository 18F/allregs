                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the  views of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division as to the scope  and applicability of the exemption provided by section 13(b)(1) of the  act have been expressed in interpretations issued from time to time in  various forms. This part, as of the date of its publication in the  Federal Register, supersedes and replaces such prior interpretations.  Its purpose is to make available in one place general interpretations of  the Administrator which will provide ``a practical guide to employers  and employees as to how the office representing the public interest in  enforcement of the law will seek to apply it.'' (Skidmore v. Swift &  Co., 323 U.S. 134)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the construction of  the law which the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator believe to be  correct in the light of the decisions of the courts, the Interstate  Commerce Commission, and since October 15, 1966, its successor, the  Secretary of Transportation, and which will guide them in the  performance of their administrative duties under the act unless and  until they are otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the  courts or conclude upon reexamination of an interpretation that it is  incorrect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public Law 89-670 (80 Stat. 931) transferred to and vested in  the Secretary of Transportation all functions, powers, and duties of the  Interstate Commerce Commission: (1) Under section 204 (a)(1) and (a)(2)  to the extent they relate to qualifications and maximum hours of service  of employees and safety of operations and equipment, and (2) under  section 204(a)(5) of the Motor Carrier Act. The interpretations  contained in this part are interpretations on which reliance may be  placed as provided in section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act (Pub. L.  49, 80th Cong., first sess. (61 Stat. 84), discussed in part 790,  statement on effect of Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947), so long as they  remain effective and are not modified, amended, rescinded, or determined  by judicial authority to be incorrect.</p>
