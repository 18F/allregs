                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 334.203-70(d), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Partial Earned Value Management System (October 2008)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor shall use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that has been validated and accepted by the Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA) as being compliant with the schedule-related guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard-748 (current version at the time of award) to manage this contract. If the Contractor's current EVMS has not been validated and accepted by the CFA at the time of award, see paragraph (b) of this clause. The Contractor shall submit EVM reports in accordance with the requirements of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, at the time of award, the Contractor's EVM system has not been validated and accepted by the CFA as complying with the schedule-related EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard-748 (current version at time of award), the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply the current system to the contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Take necessary and timely actions to meet the milestones in the Contractor's EVMS plan approved by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> HHS requires the Contractor to obtain validation and acceptance of the schedule-related portions of its EVM system by the CFA during the base period of performance of this contract. The Contracting Officer or designee will conduct a Compliance Review to assess the Contractor's compliance with its approved plan. If the Contractor does not follow the approved implementation schedule or correct all resulting system deficiencies noted during the Compliance Review within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may take remedial action, which may include, but is not limited to, suspension of or reduction in progress payments, or a reduction in fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> HHS will conduct an Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). If a pre-award IBR has not been conducted, a post-award IBR will be

conducted by HHS as early as practicable, but no later than 90 days after contract award. The Contracting Officer may also require an IBR as part of the exercise of an option or the incorporation of a major modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unless a waiver is granted by the CFA, Contractor-proposed EVMS changes require approval of the CFA prior to implementation. The CFA will advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of proposed changes from the Contractor. If the advance approval requirements are waived by the CFA, the Contractor shall disclose EVMS changes to the CFA at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of implementation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized representative as necessary to permit Government surveillance to ensure that the EVMS conforms, and continues to conform, with the requirements referenced in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Contractor shall require the subcontractors specified below to comply with the requirements of the clause: (Insert list of applicable subcontractors.)________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth0">Alternate I (October 2008) As prescribed in 334.203-70(d), the Contracting Officer shall substitute the following paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) for paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of the basic clause and delete paragraph (e) of the basic clause:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Contractor shall use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that is compliant with the schedule-related guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard-748 (current version at the time of award) to manage this contract. If the Contractor's current EVMS is not compliant at the time of award, see paragraph (b) of this clause. The Contractor shall submit EVM reports in accordance with the requirements of this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If, at the time of award, the Contractor's schedule-related EVM system is not in compliance with the schedule-related EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard-748 (current version at time of award), or the Contractor does not have an existing schedule control system that is compliant with such guidelines, the Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply the current system to the contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Take necessary and timely actions to meet the milestones in the Contractor's EVMS plan approved by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> HHS will not formally validate or accept the Contractor's schedule-related EVMS with respect to this contract. The use of the Contractor's EVMS for this contract does not imply HHS acceptance of the Contractor's EVMS for application to future contracts. The Contracting Officer or designee will conduct a Compliance Review to assess the Contractor's compliance with its approved plan. If the Contractor does not follow the approved implementation schedule or correct all resulting system deficiencies noted during the Compliance Review within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may take remedial action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension of or reduction in progress payments, or a reduction in fee.</p>
