The Administrator delegates authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in appeals filed under this part. Appeals directed to the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion filed under this part to the Administrator for decision when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so.

Fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, will be considered in determining annual potential for those stationary sources whose fugitive emissions are regulated by the applicable state implementation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Source means any source of air pollution subject to applicable legal requirements as defined in paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Technical Support Document means the Noncompliance Penalties Technical Support Document which accompanies these regulations.
