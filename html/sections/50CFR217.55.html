Each video camera will be set to record a focal  subgroup within the larger haul-out aggregation for a maximum of 4 hours  or as permitted by the videotape capacity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Systematic visual observations, by those individuals, described  in paragraph (c) of this section, of pinniped presence and activity will  be conducted and recorded in a field logbook a minimum of 2 hours prior  to the estimated launch time and for no less than 1 hour immediately  following the launch of target missiles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Systematic visual observations, by those individuals,  described in paragraph (c) of this section, of pinniped presence and  activity will be conducted and recorded in a field logbook a minimum of  2 hours prior to launch, during launch, and for no less than 1 hour  after the launch of the BQM-34, BQM-74, Tomahawk, RAM target and similar  types of missiles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documentation, both via autonomous video camera and human  observer, will consist of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Numbers and sexes of each age class in focal subgroups;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Description and timing of launch activities or other disruptive  event(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Movements of pinnipeds, including number and proportion moving,  direction and distance moved, and pace of movement;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Description of reactions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Minimum distances between interacting and reacting pinnipeds;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Study location;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Local time;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Substratum type;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Substratum slope;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Weather condition;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> Horizontal visibility; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(L)</em> Tide state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acoustic monitoring. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During all target missile launches,  calibrated recordings of the levels and characteristics of the received  launch sounds will be obtained from three different locations of varying  distances from the target missile's flight path. To the extent  practicable, these acoustic recording locations will correspond with the  haul-out sites where video and human observer monitoring is done.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acoustic recordings will be supplemented by the use of radar  and telemetry systems to obtain the trajectory of target missiles in  three dimensions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Acoustic equipment used to record launch sounds will be  suitable for collecting a wide range of parameters, including the  magnitude, characteristics, and duration of each target missile.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must implement the  following reporting requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each target missile launch, the lead contractor or lead  observer for   the holder of the Letter of Authorization must provide a status report  to NMFS, West Coast Regional Office, providing reporting items found  under the Letter of Authorization, unless other arrangements for  monitoring are agreed upon in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Navy shall submit an annual report describing their  activities and including the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Timing, number, and nature of launch operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Summary of mitigation and monitoring implementation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Summary of pinniped behavioral observations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Estimate of the amount and nature of all takes by harassment or  by other means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Navy shall submit a draft comprehensive technical report to  the Office of Protected Resources and West Coast Regional Office, NMFS,  180 days prior to the expiration of the regulations in this subpart,  providing full documentation of the methods, results, and interpretation  of all monitoring tasks for launches to date plus preliminary  information for missile launches during the first 6 months of the  regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A revised final comprehensive technical report, including all  monitoring results during the entire period of validity of the Letter of  Authorization, will be due 90 days after the end of the period of  effectiveness of the regulations in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The final report will be subject to review and comment by NMFS.  Any recommendations made by NMFS must be addressed in the final  comprehensive technical report prior to acceptance by NMFS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section, or in the Letter of Authorization issued under  Sec. Sec.  216.106 and 217.57 of this chapter, including the retention  of marine mammals, may be conducted without the need for a separate  scientific research permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In coordination and compliance with appropriate Navy  regulations, the NMFS may, at its discretion, place an observer on San  Nicolas Island for any activity involved in marine mammal monitoring  either prior to, during, or after a missile launch in order to monitor  the impact on marine mammals.</p>
