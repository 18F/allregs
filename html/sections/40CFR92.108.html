                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Intake air flow measurement. Measurement of the flow rate of intake air into the engine is allowed for engine testing, but not required. When it is

measured, the measurement technique shall conform to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The air flow measurement method used must have a range large enough to accurately measure the air flow over the engine operating range during the test. Overall measurement accuracy must be [2 percent of full-scale value of the measurement device for all modes except idle. For idle, the measurement accuracy shall be [5 percent or less of the full-scale value. The Administrator must be advised of the method used prior to testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Corrections to the measured air mass flowrate shall be made when an engine system incorporates devices that add or subtract air mass (air injection, bleed air, etc.). The method used to determine the air mass from these devices shall be approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Measurements made in accordance with SAE recommended practice J244 (incorporated by reference at Sec. 92.5) are allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Humidity and temperature measurements. (1) Air that has had its absolute humidity altered is considered humidity-conditioned air. For this type of intake air supply, the humidity measurements must be made within the intake air supply system, and after the humidity conditioning has taken place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Air that has had its absolute humidity altered is considered humidity-conditioned air. For this type of intake air supply, the humidity measurements must be made within the intake air supply system, and after the humidity conditioning has taken place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Humidity measurements for non-conditioned intake air supply systems shall be made as closely as possible to the point at which the intake air stream enters the locomotive, or downstream of that point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Temperature measurements of engine intake air, engine intake air after compression and cooling in the charge air cooler(s) (engine testing only), and air used to cool the charge air after compression, and to cool the engine shall be made as closely as possible to obtain accurate results based on engineering judgement. Measurement of ambient temperature for locomotive testing shall be made within 48 inches of the locomotive, at a location that minimizes the effect of heat generated by the locomotive on the measured temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Temperature measurements shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 92.105(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Humidity measurements shall be accurate within 2 percent of the measured absolute humidity.</p>
