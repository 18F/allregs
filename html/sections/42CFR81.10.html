                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The risk models used to estimate probability of causation for  covered employees under EEOICPA will be based on risk models updated  from the 1985 NIH Radioepidemiological Tables. These 1985 tables were  developed from analyses of cancer mortality risk among the Japanese  atomic bomb survivor cohort. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are updating the  tables, replacing them with a sophisticated analytic software program.  This program, the Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program (IREP) \1\,  models the dose-response relationship between ionizing radiation and 33  cancers using morbidity data from the same Japanese atomic bomb survivor  cohort. In the case of thyroid cancer, radiation risk models are based  on a pooled analysis of several international cohorts \1a\. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ NIOSH-IREP is available for public review on the NIOSH homepage  at: www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocasirep/html.</p><p class="depth2">\1a\ Ron E, Lubin JH, Shore RE, et al. ``Thyroid cancer after  exposure to external radiation: a pooled analysis of seven studies.''  Radiat. Res. 141:259-277, 1995. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NIOSH will change the risk models in IREP, as needed, to reflect  the radiation exposure and disease experiences of employees covered  under EEOICPA, which differ from the experiences of the Japanese atomic  bomb survivor cohort. Changes will be incorporated in a version of IREP  named NIOSH-IREP, specifically designed for adjudication of claims under  EEOICPA. Possible changes in IREP risk models include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Addition of risk models to IREP, as needed, for claims under  EEOICPA (e.g., malignant melanoma and other skin cancers)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate radiation  exposures unique to employees covered by EEOICPA (e.g., radon and low  energy x rays from employer-required medical screening programs,  adjustment of relative biological effectiveness distributions based on  neutron energy).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate new  understanding of radiation-related cancer effects relevant to employees  covered by EEOICPA (e.g., incorporation of inverse dose-rate  relationship between high LET radiation exposures and cancer; adjustment  of the low-dose effect reduction factor for acute exposures).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate new  understanding of the potential interaction between cancer risk  associated with occupational exposures to chemical carcinogens and  radiation-related cancer effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Modification of IREP risk models to incorporate temporal, race  and ethnicity-related differences in the frequency of certain cancers  occurring generally among the U.S. population.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Modifications of IREP to facilitate improved evaluation of the  uncertainty distribution for the probability of causation for claims  based on two or more primary cancers.</p>
