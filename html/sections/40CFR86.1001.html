The compliance level is rounded to the same number of significant figures contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM E29-67.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> After calculating a compliance level in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, a manufacturer may elect to increase the sample size by 4 engines or vehicles, or a multiple thereof, up to the maximum, including SEA engines or vehicles if any, of 20. Upon that election, the manufacturer shall add the additional engines or vehicles to the sample and perform paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii) of this section. This election may be repeated if appropriate. A compliance level determined under this election shall replace a previously determined compliance level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A fail decision is reached with respect to the upper limit when the compliance level determined in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the applicable upper limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initial test results are calculated following the Federal Test Procedure specified in Sec. 86.1111-87(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (c) of this section for each test engine or vehicle, dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine or vehicle, and rounding in accordance with ASTM E29-67 to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Final deteriorated test results.

The engineering and development component will be determined by multiplying the base penalty amount by the engineering and development factor for the appropriate subclass and pollutant in Sec. 86.1105-87. The amount refunded will depend on the model year in which the certification and PCA take place. In cases where payment of penalties have been waived by EPA in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, EPA will refund a portion of the engineering and development component. The proportionate refund to be paid by EPA will be based on the proportion of vehicles or engines of the nonconforming configuration for which NCPs were paid to EPA.

Sec. 86.1115-87  Hearing procedures for nonconformance determinations and penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. The procedures prescribed by this section shall apply whenever a manufacturer requests a hearing pursuant to Sec. 86.087-30(e)(6)(i), Sec. 86.087-30(e)(7), or Sec. 86.1113-87(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable to this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hearing Clerk shall mean the Hearing Clerk of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturer means a manufacturer contesting a compliance level or penalty determination sent to the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Party means the Agency and the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Presiding Officer shall mean an Administrative Law Judge appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930 as amended).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the Agency described in Sec. 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in appeals filed under this subpart. Appeals directed to the Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion filed under this subpart to the Administrator for decision when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all parties shall be so notified and the rules in this part referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Request for public hearing. (1) A manufacturer may request a hearing pursuant to Sec. 86.1113-87(f) if it disagrees with the Administrator's determination of compliance level or penalty calculation or both, or pursuant to Sec. 86.085-30(e)(6)(i) or Sec. 86.085-30(e)(7) if it disagrees with the Administrator's proposed suspension or voiding of a certificate of conformity. Requests for such a hearing shall be filed no later than 15 days:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> After receipt of the Administrator's notification of NCP, if the compliance level is in the allowable range of non-conformity, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After completion of the Production Compliance Audit, if the compliance level exceeds the upper limit, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> After receipt of the Administrator's notification of a proposed suspension or voiding of a certificate of conformity if the hearing is requested pursuant to Secs. 86.085-30(e)(6)(i) or 86.085-30(e)(7), unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the compliance level or penalty calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The request for a public hearing shall contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A statement as to which vehicle or engine subclasses or configurations are to be the subject of the hearing;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing for each vehicle or engine subclass or configuration for which the manufacturer has requested the hearing. Provided, however, That in the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 86.1113-87(f), the hearing shall be restricted to the following issues:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the compliance level was determined in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 86.1112-87(a); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Whether the penalty was calculated in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 86.1113-87(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits on each of the issues so raised; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues so raised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A copy of all requests for public hearings shall be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and shall be made available to the public during Agency business hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Summary decision.
