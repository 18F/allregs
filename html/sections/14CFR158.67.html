The audit shall be performed by an accredited independent public accountant and may be of limited scope. The accountant shall express an opinion of the fairness and reasonableness of the public agency's procedures for receiving, holding, and using PFC revenue. The accountant shall also express an opinion

on whether the quarterly report required under Sec. 158.63 fairly represents the net transactions within the PFC account. The audit may be--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Performed specifically for the PFC account; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conducted as part of an audit under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 (the Single Audit Act of 1984, Pub.
