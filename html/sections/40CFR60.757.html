commenced as required by Sec. 60.7(a)(1) and shall be submitted no later than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> June 10, 1996, for landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 but before March 12, 1996 or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after March 12, 1996.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The initial design capacity report shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be landfilled according to the permit issued by the State, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the State, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity shall be calculated using good engineering practices. The calculations shall be provided, along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The State, Tribal, local agency or Administrator may request other reasonable information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of the landfill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An amended design capacity report shall be submitted to the Administrator providing notification of an increase in the design capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill to or above 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in Sec. 60.758(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart shall submit an NMOC emission rate report to the Administrator initially and annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section.

Subsequent NMOC emission rate reports shall be submitted annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> June 10, 1996, for landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991, but before March 12, 1996, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after March 12, 1996.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 50 megagrams per year in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate shall include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based shall be provided to the Administrator. This estimate shall be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate shall be submitted to

the Administrator. The revised estimate shall cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NMOC emission rate report shall include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart is exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, after the installation of a collection and control system in compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2), during such time as the collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with Sec. Sec. 60.753 and 60.755.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i) shall submit a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator within 1 year of the first report required under paragraph (b) of this section in which the emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in Sec. 60.754(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting shall be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, shall be submitted within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 50 megagrams per year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant (k), as provided in Tier 3 in Sec. 60.754(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 50 Mg/yr, annual periodic reporting shall be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) shall be used in the emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of Sec. 60.754(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) shall be submitted to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated emission rate exceeding 50 megagrams per year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill shall submit a closure report to the Administrator within 30 days of waste acceptance cessation. The Administrator may request additional information as may be necessary to verify that permanent closure has taken place in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 258.60. If a closure report has been submitted to the Administrator, no additional wastes may be placed into the landfill without filing a notification of modification as described under Sec. 60.7(a)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill shall submit an equipment removal report to the Administrator 30 days prior to removal or cessation of operation of the control equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The equipment removal report shall contain all of the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of the closure report submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the initial performance test report demonstrating that the 15 year minimum control period has expired; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Dated copies of three successive NMOC emission rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer producing 50 megagrams or greater of NMOC per year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify that all of the conditions for removal in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(v) have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each owner or operator of a landfill seeking to comply with Sec. 60.752(b)(2) using an active collection system designed in accordance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii) shall submit to the Administrator annual reports of the recorded information in (f)(1) through (f)(6) of this paragraph.
