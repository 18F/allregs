                            <p class="depth0">Accounting authorities accept their certifications on condition that  they are subject to audit of their settlement activities by the  Commission or its representative. Additionally, the Commission reserves  the right to verify any statement(s) made or any materials submitted to  the Commission under these rules. Verification may involve discussions  with ship owners or others as well as the requirement to submit  additional information to the Commission. Failure to respond  satisfactorily to any audit findings is grounds for forfeiture or  suspension or cancellation of authority to act as an accounting  authority for U.S. vessels.</p>
