                            <p class="depth0">All labels must meet the following specifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Layout--(1) For gasoline labels. The label is 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide x 2\1/2\ inches (6.35 cm) long. The illustrations appearing at the end of this rule are prototype labels that demonstrate the proper layout. ``Helvetica Black'' or equivalent type is used throughout except for the octane rating number on octane labels, which is in Franklin gothic type. All type is centered. Spacing of the label is \1/4\ inch (.64 cm) between the top border and the first line of text, \1/8\ inch (.32 cm) between the first and second line of text, \1/4\ inch (.64 cm) between the octane rating and the line of text above it. All text and numerals are centered within the interior borders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For alternative liquid automotive fuel labels (one principal component), other than biodiesel, biomass-based diesel, biodiesel blends, or biomass-based diesel blends. The label is 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide x 2\1/2\ inches (6.35 cm) long. ``Helvetica Black'' or equivalent type is used throughout. All type is centered. The band at the top of the label contains the name of the fuel. This band should measure 1 inch (2.54 cm) deep. Spacing of the fuel name is \1/4\ inch (.64 cm) from the top of the label and \3/16\ inch (.48 cm) from the bottom of the black band, centered horizontally within the black band. The first line of type beneath the black band is \1/8\ inch (.32 cm) from the bottom of the black band. All type below the black band is centered horizontally, with \1/8\ inch (.32 cm) between each line. The bottom line of type is \3/16\ inch (.48 cm) from the bottom of the label. All type should fall no closer than \3/16\ inch (.48 cm) from the side edges of the label. If you wish to change the dimensions of this one principal component label to accommodate a fuel descriptor that is longer than shown in the sample labels, you must petition the Federal Trade Commission. You can do this by writing to the Secretary of the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. You must state the size and contents of the label that you wish to use, and the reasons that you want to use it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For alternative liquid automotive fuel labels (two components). The label is 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide x 2\1/2\ inches (6.35 cm) long. ``Helvetica Black'' or equivalent type is used throughout. All type is centered.

All type below the black band is centered horizontally, with \1/8\ inch (.32 cm) between each line. The bottom line of type is \1/4\ inch (.64 cm) from the bottom of the label. All type should fall no closer than \3/16\ inch (.48 cm) from the side edges of the label. If you wish to change the dimensions of this two component label to accommodate additional fuel components, you must petition the Federal Trade Commission. You can do this by writing to the Secretary of the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. You must state the size and contents of the label that you wish to use, and the reasons that you want to use it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For biodiesel blends containing more than 5 percent and no greater than 20 percent biodiesel by volume.
