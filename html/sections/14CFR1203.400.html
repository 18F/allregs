                            <p class="depth0">Technological and operational information and material, and in some exceptional cases scientific information falling within any one or more of the following categories, must be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause some degree of damage to the national security. In cases where it is believed that a contrary course of action would better serve the national interests, the matter should be referred to the Chairperson, NISPC, for a determination. It is not intended that this list be exclusive; original classifiers are responsible for initially classifying any other type of information which, in their judgment, requires protection under Sec. 1.4 of ``the Order.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Military plans, weapons systems, or operations;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foreign government information;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Intelligence activities (including covert activities), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The development, production, or plans relating to the use of weapons of mass destruction.
