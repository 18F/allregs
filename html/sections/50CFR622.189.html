                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tending restriction. A sea bass pot in the South Atlantic EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a person (other than an authorized officer) aboard the vessel permitted to fish such pot or aboard another vessel if such vessel has on board written consent of the owner or operator of the vessel so permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Configuration restriction. In the South Atlantic EEZ, sea bass pots may not be used or possessed in multiple configurations, that is, two or more pots may not be attached one to another so that their overall dimensions exceed those allowed for an individual sea bass pot. This does not preclude connecting individual pots to a line, such as a ``trawl'' or trot line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requirement for escape mechanisms. (1) A sea bass pot that is used or possessed in the South Atlantic EEZ between 3515.19 N. lat. (due east of Cape Hatteras Light, NC) and 2835.1 N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL) is required to have--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sea bass pot that is used or possessed in the South Atlantic EEZ between 3515.19 N. lat.

The hinges and fasteners of each panel or door must be made of one of the following degradable materials:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding

0.041 inches (1.0 mm), that is, 19 gauge wire.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Galvanic timed-release mechanisms with a letter grade designation (degradability index) no higher than J.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An unobstructed escape vent opening on at least two opposite vertical sides, excluding top and bottom. The minimum dimensions of an escape vent opening (based on inside measurement) are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 1\1/8\ by 5\3/4\ inches (2.9 by 14.6 cm) for a rectangular vent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 1.75 by 1.75 inches (4.5 by 4.5 cm) for a square vent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 2.0-inch (5.1-cm) diameter for a round vent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Construction requirements and mesh sizes.

(1) A sea bass pot must be removed from the water in the South Atlantic EEZ and the vessel must be returned to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp at the conclusion of each trip. Sea bass pots may remain on the vessel at the conclusion of each trip.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sea bass pot must be removed from the water in the South Atlantic EEZ and the vessel must be returned to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp at the conclusion of each trip. Sea bass pots may remain on the vessel at the conclusion of each trip.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A sea bass pot must be removed from the water in the South Atlantic EEZ when the applicable quota specified in Sec. 622.190(a)(5) is reached. After a closure is in effect, a black sea bass may not be retained by a vessel that has a sea bass pot on board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Restriction on number of pots. A vessel that has on board a valid Federal commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper and a South Atlantic black sea bass pot endorsement that fishes in the South Atlantic EEZ on a trip with black sea bass pots, may possess only 35 black sea bass pots per vessel per permit year. Each black sea bass pot in the water or onboard a vessel in the South Atlantic EEZ, must have a valid identification tag attached. Endorsement holders must apply for new tags each permit year through NMFS to replace tags from the previous year.</p>
