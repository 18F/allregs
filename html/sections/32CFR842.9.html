                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A claim includes all damages accruing to a claimant by reason of an accident or incident. For example, when the same claimant has a claim for property damage and personal injury arising out of the same incident, each claim represents only a part of a single claim or cause of action. Even if local law permits filing a separate claim for property damage and for personal injury, do not settle or pay a separate or split claim without the advance approval of HQ USAF/JACC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing for an advance payment, and subsequently filing a claim, does not constitute splitting a claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Process the claim of a subrogor (insured) and subrogee (insurer) for damages arising out of the same incident as a single claim where permitted. If either claim or the combined claim exceeds, or is expected to exceed, settlement limits, send it to the next higher settlement authority. Do not split subrogated claims to avoid settlement limits.</p>
