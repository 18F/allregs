Any one of the following defects, or any combination of defects the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as serious damage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Growth cracks when more than 4 branches are affected by growth cracks which are over one-half inch in length, or when more than 8 branches have growth cracks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Horizontal cracks when more than 5 branches have horizontal cracks which are over one-half inch in length, or when more than 8 branches have horizontal cracks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pithy branches when more than 4 are pithy in that portion of the midrib between a point 1\1/2\ inches above the point of attachment to the base and the first node, or between a point 1\1/2\ inches below the first node and the point of attachment to the base, or when pith occurs at both ends of the midrib and more than a total of 1\1/2\ inches is affected: Provided, That stalks having 6 outer branches or less shall have not more than one-half of the outer branches affected by pith as described above;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Seedstems when the length of seedstem exceeds 3 times the diameter of the stalk (see Sec. Sec. 51.587 and 51.588);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Dirt when dirt is badly caked on the stalk;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Doubles when the inner branches are not fairly well protected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disease: (1) Brown stem, cracked stem and crater blotch when seriously affecting more than 4 branches, or when the aggregate area exceeds 1 square inch on the branches; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discoloration when each of more than 5 branches or \1/2\ of the branches of the stalk, whichever is less, has more than 3 distinct hair-like lines more than 3 inches long occurring on the outer side of the branch or an aggregate area of more than \1/4\ by 1 inch of blotch or solid type discoloration occurring on the inner side;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Insects when worms are present, or when insect injury affects the midrib portion of more than 4 branches, or when injury on other portions seriously affects the appearance of the stalk; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mechanical injury when the root has been cut off too closely leaving the branches without support; when more than 4 branches are materially scuffed or bruised; when the branches have been broken above the first node to an extent which seriously affects the appearance; or when more than 4 branches are broken below the first node except all branches may be cut

below the first node provided the stalk is of the length specified.</p>
