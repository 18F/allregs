                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Current acquisition standards (Fed. Std. No. 313 and Fed. Std.  No. 123) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation require that  manufacturers identify and document potential hazards on material safety  data sheets (MSDSs) as part of the acquisition process. Acquisition of  MSDSs is also prescribed by the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) regulations found in 29 CFR part 1910 and  paragraph 1-602(c) of Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and  Health Programs for Federal Employees, dated February 26, 1980. GSA's  Federal Supply Service (4FQ) maintains an automated data base,  accessible via modem and computer terminal, that contains MSDSs for all  GSA-procured hazardous materials. In addition to display of the MSDS on  the terminal screen, the system allows for the addition of the MSDS to  the user's local data base and the transmission of the MSDS via  facsimile to the user's site. Detailed instructions on how to access  this system may be obtained by sending a self-addressed envelope to  General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service, Attn: MSDS  Coordinator, 401 W. Peachtree St., NE, suite 3021, Atlanta, Georgia  30365.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Hazardous Materials Information System (HMIS) is a  collection of MSDS information, transportation information, and disposal  information that was established by the Department of Defense to assist  personnel who handle, store, ship, use or dispose of hazardous  materials. Each record in the data base is defined by a stock number  (either national stock number or local numbers), the manufacturer's  contractor and Government entity (CAGE) code, and a part number  indicator which is linked to the manufacturer's part number or trade  name. The data base (DoD 6050.5L) is available on microfiche and compact  disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) through the Naval Computer and  Telecommunication Area Master Station, Atlantic (NCTAMS LANT), Attn.:  Code 911.3, Norfolk, VA 23511-5355.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For items not listed or adequately described in the HMIS or on a  MSDS, contact the procuring agency, the manufacturer, or your technical  staff for information as to the potential hazards of the item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Some hazardous items were acquired by Federal agencies prior to  implementation of the standards requiring identification of potential  hazards. Identification and documentation of the hazardous nature of  such items is the responsibility of the owning or holding agency.  Hazardous materials are found in most Federal supply classification  (FSC) classes. Section 101-42.1101 contains a table of FSC classes  composed predominantly of hazardous items and a table of FSC groups and  classes which contain a significant number of hazardous items. These  tables are designed to assist Federal agencies in reviewing personal  property inventories to identify hazardous materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When an item has been determined hazardous, the owning Federal  agency shall document the accountable inventory record accordingly. If  the item has not been appropriately labeled by the manufacturer or  distributor, the owning agency shall appropriately label, mark, or tag  the item in accordance with OSHA requirements (29 CFR 1910.1200)  regarding the   actual or potential hazard associated with the handling, storage, or use  of the item to include hazardous chemical(s) contained and the name of  the chemical manufacturer, importer, or responsible party as defined at  29 CFR 1910.1200(c). Such information shall be maintained in the item  record for use in preparation of reports of excess property,  reassignment or transfer documentation, and other documentation  requirements that may arise.</p>
