                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The General Bridge Act of 1946 requires the approval of the  location and plans of bridges prior to start of construction (33 U.S.C.  525). The Commandant has given his advance approval to the location and  plans of bridges to be constructed across reaches of waterways navigable  in law, but not actually navigated other than   by logs, log rafts, rowboats, canoes and small motorboats. In such cases  the clearances provided for high water stages will be considered  adequate to meet the reasonable needs of navigation. The Coast Guard  recommends notice to the District Bridge Manager to ensure that the  District has determined that advance approval provision is applicable to  the waterway reach over which the bridge is to be constructed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term ``small motorboats'' shall be interpreted in the light  of the things and conditions with which it is associated. The term means  rowboats, canoes and other similar craft with outboard motors. It does  not include sailing or cabin cruiser craft.  (14 U.S.C. 633; 33 U.S.C. 401, 491, and 525; and 49 CFR 1.46(c))  [CGFR 67-46, 32 FR 17771, Dec. 12, 1967, as amended by CGD 81-076, 46 FR  54936, Nov. 5, 1981; USCG-1998-3799, 63 FR 35527, June 30, 1998; USCG- 2013-0397, 78 FR 39174, July 1, 2013]</p>
