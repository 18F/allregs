                            <p class="depth0">Assistant Attorneys General are authorized, with respect to matters assigned to their respective divisions, to close (other than by compromise or by entry of judgment) claims asserted by the United States in all cases in which they would have authority to accept offers in compromise of such claims under Sec.  0.160(a), except:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When for any reason, the closing of a particular claim would, as a practical matter, control or adversely influence the disposition of other claims and the closing of all the claims taken

together would exceed the authority delegated by this section; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Assistant Attorney General concerned is of the opinion that because of a question of law or policy presented, or because of opposition to the proposed closing by the department or agency involved, or for any other reason, the proposed closing should receive the personal attention of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General or the Associate Attorney General, as appropriate.
