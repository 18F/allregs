                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The responsibilities of shippers vary with their  contracts with growers to purchase produce or to handle produce on joint  account. Similarly, their responsibilities to their customers depend  upon their contracts to sell, consign or joint account produce with  dealers on terminal markets. Shippers shall pay promptly for produce  purchased and any deficits incurred on consigned shipments. They shall  fully comply with their obligations in connection with joint account  transactions. A shipper who fails to perform any express or implied duty  is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages  resulting therefrom. The shipper shall prepare and   maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the details of his  transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Receiving records. Each shipper shall prepare and maintain a  record of all produce handled including his own production. This record  shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound book), with numbered  pages or comparable business records. This receiving record shall show  for each lot the date received, whether purchased or received on joint  account, the quantity, quality, and kind of produce, the purchase price  or joint account cost, and the name and address of the supplier.  Shippers shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposition records. When a shipper purchases produce from  growers or others, his records shall also show the disposition of the  produce, whether sold or consigned, date of shipment, car number, or if  shipped by truck, the license number, name and address of the carrier,  name and address of the buyer, commission merchant or auction, and other  pertinent details of the transaction, such as the terms of sale, selling  price, and date of payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Joint accounts with growers. When a shipper enters into a joint  account transaction with growers or others, the agreement between the  parties should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the  duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the  shipper's authority in distributing the produce. The shipper shall  prepare and maintain records to show in detail the actual expenses  incurred for the services he furnishes, such as harvesting, grading,  packing and selling the produce (unless a fixed charge is agreed upon by  the parties to cover the cost of these services), methods of  distribution and proceeds received for the produce. If a shipper is at  the same time handling similar produce not involved in the joint account  transaction, a lot number or other positive means of identification  shall be assigned to each lot of produce received in order to segregate  and identify the various lots of produce. If a shipper consigns all or  part of the produce or employs the services of brokers or terminal  market auctions, his records shall show the results of these  transactions, including the expenses involved and the names and  addresses of the commission merchants, brokers, and the auctions. The  shipper shall render a detailed and accurate accounting and pay promptly  the net proceeds due the joint partner, in accordance with Sec.  46.2(y), (z), and (aa). The accounting shall disclose the status of all  claims collected or filed with the carriers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Joint accounts with receivers. When a shipper enters into a  joint account agreement with a terminal market dealer, the agreement  should be reduced to writing clearly defining the terms of the  agreement. The shipper's records shall show the expenses which may be  properly charged in accordance with the joint agreement, purchase price  or joint account cost of the produce, and cost of harvesting, packing,  grading, or other expenses. His records shall show the quantity and  quality of the produce packed and shipped, the dates and methods of  shipment, and all other pertinent details of his operation. At the  conclusion of the transaction, a detailed and accurate accounting shall  be furnished promptly to the joint partner, in accordance with Sec.  46.2(z). If a deficit results, the shipper shall pay promptly his share  of the deficit.</p>
