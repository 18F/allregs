                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inspection stations. An inspection station shall be any plant of  a handler, and any other place where he handles prunes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Outgoing inspection. Except as otherwise specifically provided,  no handler shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of natural  condition prunes or of processed prunes unless he has, prior to such  shipment or final disposition, had them inspected and obtained a  certificate showing that such prunes meet the effective minimum  standards. Such inspection shall be made during that portion of the  final preparation of the prunes for shipment or other final disposition  as will permit proper sampling, whether in-line or floor inspection, and  no handler shall perform such final preparation unless an inspector is  present. The handler shall furnish promptly to the inspector a copy of  the shipping or disposition order or other documents, which shall show  the date of each shipment or disposition, the applicable reference  number thereof, and an adequate description of the shipment or  disposition. For the prunes inspected each day which meet the applicable  minimum grade and size requirements for standard prunes, or standard  processed prunes, the handler shall cause the inspector to issue in  triplicate a signed certificate containing the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date and place of inspection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name and address of the handler and of the inspection  service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number and size of packages or the net weight of prunes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The number of the worksheet or worksheets on which the  inspector's computations and results of tests are recorded; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement that the prunes meet the effective minimum standards  for standard prunes, or standard processed prunes, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> and  those prunes held by him for the account of the Committee pursuant to  Sec. 993.57, a handler may transfer prunes to another handler within  the area. Any such interhandler transfer may be without the transferring  handler having an inspection made as provided for in Sec. 993.51:  Provided, That before each such transfer the transferring handler shall:  (1) Give written notice of the transfer to the inspection service  including the proposed date of the transfer, the names of the handlers  and, by plant designation, the present location and the destination of  the prunes, the number of containers, variety, size designation, and  total net weight of the prunes, and the manifest or billing number; and  (2) receive from the inspection service a DFA Form P-5 ``Shipping  Inspection Report and Certificate'' marked ``Interhandler Transfer  Report'' on which the inspection service recorded the information  furnished by the transferring handler. The transferring handler shall  sign the ``Interhandler Transfer Report'' including all copies thereof  that were received from the inspection service, and forward the signed  original and one copy to the receiving handler at the time of the  interhandler transfer. Upon receipt of the transferred prunes, the  receiving handler shall enter on both the original and the copy the date  he received the prunes, sign the original, and immediately forward it to  the inspection service. The transferring handler shall cause the  inspection service to promptly report the transfer to the Committee. As  provided in Sec. 993.50(f), the receiving handler shall, before  shipping or otherwise making final disposition of such prunes, comply  with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 993.50 and 993.51.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tolerances for non-French prunes. Any lot of standard prunes or  standard processed prunes containing more than 2 percent by weight of  non-French prunes shall be disposed of only in prune product outlets as  prescribed in Sec. 993.50(c) unless the non-French prunes therein have  an average count of 40 or less per pound and unless in a 100-ounce  sample of the lot, the count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest  prunes in the sample does not vary from the count per pound of 10 ounces  of the largest prunes in the sample by more than 35 points. A lot shall  be deemed to exceed the 2 percent tolerance for non-French prunes  whenever an inspection shows such prunes exceed 2 percent in any four  consecutive sampling units of two tons or less or, if less than four   such units are sampled, in such lesser number of units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prunes which fail to meet minimum standards--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Committee's  approval of disposition--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. Those defective prunes accumulated  by a handler by removing them from standard or substandard prunes, and  those prunes received or held by a handler which fail to meet the  applicable minimum standards and are held for disposition without  removal of defective prunes in excess of maximum tolerances, may only be  used, if within the tolerances prescribed in Sec. 993.97 II. C. (1),  (2), and (3), for prune products, or if any such tolerances are exceeded  and any live infestation corrected by fumigation, for non-human  consumption or be destroyed. In order to insure that all such prunes are  shipped or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Sec. 993.50(e), no  handler shall during any crop year ship or otherwise make final  disposition of any such prunes, other than prune waste subject to daily  non-human disposition for sanitation purposes, unless prior thereto he  had obtained during that crop year (except as otherwise provided in  paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section) the Committee's approval of his  application to do so.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Application for approval. The handler's application to ship or  otherwise make final disposition of any such prunes shall be submitted  on Form PMC 2.2 ``Application for Permission to Dispose of Substandard  Prunes''. If the prunes are for shipment, the application shall set  forth: (a) The name and address of the handler's vendee and the name and  address of the consignee whether the same as or different from the  vendee; (b) the particular use to be made of the prunes; (c) if such use  is to be by a person other than the handler's vendee or the consignee,  the name and address of such user; and (d) the crop year or the period  within, or the portion of, the crop year during which shipments are to  be made. When the use or the name and address of the consignee or user  are not known by the handler, the handler shall arrange for the  submission of such information to the Committee. If use is to be by the  handler, the application shall so indicate and shall set forth all  applicable information. Each application for shipment shall be limited  to the handler's vendee and the consignee if different from the vendee,  and to a specific user and use, and may be open as to quantity:  Provided, That, when the use or name and address of the user are not  known by the handler, the application shall include the quantity of  prunes to be shipped and be limited to that quantity. Each application  for final disposition for a particular use by the handler shall be  limited to such handler and use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Approval of applications. The Committee's approval of a  handler's application shall be transmitted to the handler on Form PMC  2.3 ``Permission to Dispose of Substandard Prunes''. In approving an  application, the Committee shall specify the crop year, or the period  within or the portion of the crop year, for which the approval is  granted: Provided, That, the Committee may approve in July any such  application that is submitted during that month by the handler for  shipment or other final disposition of the prunes covered thereby in the  succeeding crop year. When the use or the name and address of the user  or consignee are not known to the handler, the Committee shall not  approve the application until it has been informed as to such use and  user and consignee of the prunes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Disapproval of applications; or revocation of approved  applications. In acting on an application, the Committee may disapprove  the application when: (a) The application does not conform with the  requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; (b) the Committee  has cause to believe that the prunes covered by the application will not  be shipped or disposed of in accordance with the application; or (c) the  handler, or any of the parties involved in the proposed shipment or  disposition, had shipped or made other disposition of prunes covered by  a previously approved application inconsistent with that application.  The Committee may for cause revoke a   handler's previously approved application if he ships or makes other  disposition inconsistent with such application. Whenever a user uses  prunes inconsistent with an approved application, the Committee may for  cause revoke such application, and such other approved applications  applicable to such user as the Committee deems necessary to assure that  the prunes covered by such applications will not be used in a manner  inconsistent with those applications or the order. The Committee shall  notify the handler in writing of each disapproval and each revocation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Evidence of non-human disposition. Whenever defective or  substandard prunes or prune waste are shipped to or otherwise disposed  of in non-human consumption outlets, or destroyed, the handler shall  furnish the Committee with a copy of the shipping document or other  documentary evidence of the disposition as may be satisfactory to the  Committee and at such times as the Committee may direct.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Books and records. Each handler who ships or otherwise disposes  of defective or substandard prunes or prune waste shall make available  for examination by the Committee, at his business office at any  reasonable time during business hours, copies of all applicable purchase  orders, sales contracts, or disposition documents, together with any  further information which the Committee may deem necessary or desirable  to enable it to determine whether such prunes or prune waste have been  or will likely be utilized as authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Out of the area shipments. Whenever substandard prunes for human  consumption are packed in closed containers, and if for shipment outside  the area they shall be so packed, each such container shall be clearly  marked ``For Manufacturing Purposes Only''. Whenever substandard prunes  restricted to non-human usage are shipped in closed containers, each  such container shall be clearly marked ``For Non-Human Usage''. In each  instance, the letters shall be of reasonable prominence and in a  conspicuous place on the container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspection of substandard prunes. Each handler shall cause  substandard prunes, for use in prune products, to be inspected (prior to  disposition or shipment by a handler) by an inspector, and that such  inspector issue, in triplicate, a signed clearance certificate (for the  preparation of which the handler shall make available to the inspector  the necessary data) containing the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date and place of inspection and clearance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The name and address of the inspection service and of the  handler;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number and kind of packages, the net weight, and the  adequacy of the marking;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The lot number or shipping or disposition order number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The committee's approval number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The destination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The actual percentage of off-grade prunes of each group, or  combination of groups, of defects in excess of the then current  tolerances for standard prunes or standard processed prunes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pitted prunes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For human consumption as such. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No handler  shall ship or otherwise make final disposition of any lot of pitted  prunes for human consumption as pitted prunes unless the lot, before  pitting, met (A) the applicable minimum standard set forth in Sec.  993.97 (Exhibit A), or as such standards may be modified, for standard  prunes or standard processed prunes, and (B) the requirements specified  in Sec. 993.50 (c) and (d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, pitted prunes means prunes with the pit  removed that are characterized by a uniform depression and minimal skin  break where the pit has been removed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>, macerated prunes means prunes with the pit removed that are  characterized by a flattened appearance with slightly more skin breaks  where the pit has been removed than with pitted prunes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, and (3), may be  pitted and shipped or disposed of for use and used in prune products for  human consumption: Provided, That prior to shipment or other final  disposition by handler, such prunes have lost their form and character  as prunes to the satisfaction of the inspector and the committee. An  inspection certificate on such lot shall not be issued until the  inspector has determined that the prunes therein have lost their form  and character as prunes. Disposition of pitted prunes by handlers for  use in prune products shall be in accordance with the applicable  provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of undersized prunes--(1) Application for and  approval of disposition. Undersized prunes accumulated by a handler  pursuant to section 993.49(c) shall be disposed of in non-human  consumption outlets during the crop year in which the prunes  establishing such obligations were received from producers or  dehydrators, or such later date that a handler may request in a notice,  filed with the Committee at least 30 days prior to July 31 of the year  of accumulation: Provided, That, such handler has made a bona fide  effort to dispose of its undersized prunes as demonstrated by the  shipment of at least 65 percent of its undersized obligation by May 31;  such handler has a sufficient quantity of undersized prunes held in  storage to meet its remaining obligation; and the extension of time  requested is not later than 60 days beyond the end of the crop year.  Prior to making any such disposition, the handler shall obtain the  Committee's approval of his application to do so. The handler's  application to ship or otherwise make final disposition of any such  undersized prunes shall be submitted on Form PMC 2.21 ``Application for  Permission to Dispose of Undersized Prunes'' which shall set forth: (i)  The name and address of the handler's vendee and the name and address of  the consignee whether the same as or different from the vendee; (ii) the  particular use to be made of the prunes; (iii) if such use is to be by a  person other than the handler's vendee or the consignee, the name and  address of such user; and (iv) the crop year or the period within, or  portion of, the crop year during which shipment or other disposition is  to be made. When the use or the name and address of the consignee or  user are not known by the handler, the handler shall arrange for the  submission of such information to the Committee. If use is to be by the  handler, the application shall so indicate and shall set forth all  applicable information. Each application for shipment shall be limited  to the handler's vendee and the consignee, if different from the vendee,  and to a specific user and use. Each application for final disposition  for a particular use by the handler shall be limited to such handler and  use. The Committee's approval of a handler's application shall be  transmitted to the handler on Form PMC 2.31 ``Permission to Dispose of  Undersized Prunes.'' In approving an application, the Committee shall  specify the crop year or the period within, or the portion of, the crop  year for which the approval is granted. When the use or name and address  of the user or consignee are not known to the handler, the Committee  shall not approve the application until it has been informed as to such  use and user and consignee of the prunes. The requirements of Sec.  993.150(e)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em> (except item (a) thereof), (v), and (vi) with regard  to disapproval of applications or revocation of approved applications,  evidence of nonhuman disposition, and the maintenance of books and  records, applicable to prunes which fail to meet minimum standards,  shall also apply to undersized prunes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentation of disposition of undersized prunes--(i)  Documentation of   shipment or other disposition. For each quantity of undersized prunes so  shipped or otherwise disposed of, the handler shall promptly forward to  the Committee one copy of the applicable bill of lading, truck receipt,  or related documentation of disposition which shall show: (a) The name  of the consignee; (b) the destination by name and address of the person  designated to receive the prunes; (c) the date of shipment or other  disposition; (d) the net weight of the prunes; and (e) identification of  the prunes as undersized prunes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tolerances permitting a deviation in prune sizes from applicable  undersized openings--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Undersized French prunes. Whenever an  undersized regulation specifies an opening for French prunes, any  quantity of any size of French prunes disposed of by a handler in  compliance with Sec. 993.50(g) shall satisfy a handler's undersized  disposition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Undersized non-French prunes. Whenever an undersized regulation  specifies an opening for non-French prunes, any quantity of any size of  non-French prunes disposed of by a handler in compliance with Sec.  993.50(g) shall satisfy a handler's undersized disposition.
