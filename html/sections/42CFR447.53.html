                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The agency may establish differential cost sharing for preferred and non-preferred drugs. The provisions in Sec.  447.56(a) shall apply except as the agency exercises the option under paragraph (d) of this section. All drugs will be considered preferred drugs if so identified or if the agency does not differentiate between preferred and non-preferred drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At state option, cost sharing for drugs may be established at or below the amounts shown in the following table (except that the maximum allowable cost sharing shall be increased each year, beginning October 1, 2015, by the percentage increase in the medical care component of the CPI-U for the period of September to September of the preceding calendar year, rounded to the next higher 5-cent increment. Such increase shall not be applied to any cost sharing that is based on the amount the agency pays for the service):

In such cases the agency must ensure that reimbursement to the pharmacy is based on the appropriate cost sharing amount.</p>
