All staybolts shall be hammer tested at every 31 service day inspection, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. All staybolts also shall be hammer tested under hydrostatic pressure any time hydrostatic pressure above the MAWP specified on the boiler specification form (FRA Form No. 4), is applied to the boiler. (See appendix B of this part.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. All staybolts shall be hammer tested at every 31 service day inspection, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. All staybolts also shall be hammer tested under hydrostatic pressure any time hydrostatic pressure above the MAWP specified on the boiler specification form (FRA Form No. 4), is applied to the boiler. (See appendix B of this part.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception for inaccessible staybolts. The removal of brickwork or grate bearers for the purpose of hammer testing staybolts during each 31 service day inspection will not be required if the staybolts behind these structural impediments have a telltale hole \3/16\ inch to \7/32\ inch in diameter their entire length. Whenever the brickwork or grate bearers are removed for any other reason, however, the bolts shall be inspected at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of hammer testing. If staybolts are tested while the boiler contains water, the hydrostatic pressure must be not less than 95 percent of the MAWP. The steam locomotive owner and/or operator shall tap each bolt with a hammer and determine broken bolts from the sound or the vibration of the sheet. Whenever staybolts are tested while the boiler is not under pressure, such as during the 31 service day inspection, the staybolt test must be made with all the water drained from the boiler.</p>
