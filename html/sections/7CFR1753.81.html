                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon completion and prior to closeout, minor construction must be inspected and certified to be in compliance with RUS construction standards, to be reasonable in cost, and to meet applicable codes. The certification is made by an experienced telephone engineer who is either licensed in the state where the inspection will be performed, or is a borrower's staff engineer, who meets the requirements of the ``employee in charge'' of force account engineering as described in subpart B of this part. The GFR will periodically audit the inspection of minor construction to ensure integrity of the procedure. RUS borrowers with less than 2000 subscribers may use the above procedure or have construction inspection performed by the GFR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Engineering services for minor construction may be contracted using RUS Form 245, Engineering Service Contract--Special Services. Costs for these services may be included in the costs for construction on the Form 771. (See subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon completion of construction, the borrower shall obtain the engineer's certification on RUS Form 771. An official of the borrower, designated by the board of directors, shall also execute the borrower's certification on Form 771.
