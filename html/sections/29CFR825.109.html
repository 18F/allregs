                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Most employees of the government of the United States, if they are covered by the FMLA, are covered under Title II of the FMLA (incorporated in Title V, Chapter 63, Subchapter 5 of the United States Code) which is administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has separate regulations at 5 CFR Part 630, Subpart L. Employees of the Government Printing Office are covered by Title II. While employees of the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress are covered by Title I of the FMLA, the Comptroller General of the United States and the Librarian of Congress, respectively, have responsibility for the administration of the FMLA with respect to these employees. Other legislative branch employees, such as employees of the Senate and House of Representatives, are covered by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1301.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Federal Executive Branch employees within the jurisdiction of these regulations include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Employees of the Postal Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees of the Postal Regulatory Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A part-time employee who does not have an established regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employee serving under an intermittent appointment or temporary appointment with a time limitation of one year or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Employees of other Federal executive agencies are also covered by these regulations if they are not covered by Title II of FMLA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employees of the judicial branch of the United States are covered by these regulations only if they are employed in a unit which has employees in the competitive service. For example, employees of the U.S. Tax Court are covered by these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For employees covered by these regulations, the U.S. Government constitutes a single employer for purposes of determining employee eligibility. These employees must meet all of the requirements for eligibility, including the requirement that the Federal Government employ 50 employees at the worksite or within 75 miles.</p>
