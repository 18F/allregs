                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Rural health care provider site--individual and consortium. Under the Healthcare Connect Fund, an eligible rural health care provider may receive universal service support by applying individually or through a consortium. For purposes of the Healthcare Connect Fund, a ``consortium'' is a group of two or more health care provider sites that request support through a single application. Consortia may include health care providers who are not eligible for support under the Healthcare Connect Fund, but such health care providers cannot receive support for their expenses and must participate pursuant to the cost allocation guidelines in Sec. 54.639(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Limitation on participation of non-rural health care provider sites in a consortium. An eligible non-rural health care provider site may receive universal service support only as part of a consortium that includes more than 50 percent eligible rural health care provider sites.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on large non-rural hospitals. Each eligible non-rural public or non-profit hospital site with 400 or more licensed patient beds may receive no more than $30,000 per year in Healthcare Connect Fund support for eligible recurring charges and no more than $70,000 in Healthcare Connect Fund support every 5 years for eligible nonrecurring charges, exclusive in both cases of costs shared by the network.
