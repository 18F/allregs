                            <p class="depth0">Terrestrial private operational fixed point-to-point licensees in  the 12.2-12.7 GHz band which were licensed prior to MVDDS or NGSO FSS  satellite stations are incumbent point-to-point stations and are not  entitled to protection from harmful interference caused by later MVDDS  or NGSO FSS entrants in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, except for public safety  stations which must be protected. MVDDS and NGSO FSS operators have the  responsibility of resolving any harmful interference problems that their  operations may cause to these public safety incumbent point-to-point  operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Incumbent public safety  terrestrial point-to-point licensees may only make minor changes to  their stations without losing this protection. This does not relieve  current point-to-point licensees of their obligation to protect BSS  operations in the subject frequency band. All point-to-point  applications, including low-power operations, for new licenses, major  amendments to pending applications, or major modifications to existing  licenses for the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are no longer accepted except for  renewals and changes in ownership. See Sec. 1.929 of this chapter for  definitions of major and minor changes.</p>
