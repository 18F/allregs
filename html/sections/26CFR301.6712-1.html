                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Penalty imposed. A taxpayer who fails in a material way to  disclose one or more positions taken for a taxable year, as required by  section 6114 and the regulations thereunder, is subject to a separate  penalty for each failure to disclose a position taken with respect to  each separate payment or separate income item in the amount of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a corporation taxable as such under the Code $10,000; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other taxpayers, $1,000.  The penalty imposed by this section may be imposed more than once for a  single taxable year if a taxpayer has failed to disclose one or more  positions taken with respect to more than one separate payment or  separate income item and may be imposed in addition to any other penalty  imposed by law. For this purpose, separate payments or income items of  the same type (e.g., interest payments) received from the same ultimate  payor (e.g., the obligor on the note) will be treated as separate  payments or income items (and not aggregated). However, for purposes of  determining the number of separate penalties to be imposed under this  section, the District Director shall have the discretion to aggregate  separate payments or income items, in whole or in part, in accordance  with the rules for aggregation of such items for purposes of reporting,  as described in Sec. 301.6114-1(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Code, the penalty imposed by paragraph (a) of this  section may be waived, in whole or in part, if it is established to the  satisfaction of the Assistant Commissioner (International), the District  Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center that the  taxpayer's failure to disclose the required information was not due to  willful neglect. An affirmative showing of lack of willful neglect must  be made in the form of a written statement that sets forth all the facts  alleged to show lack of willful neglect and contains a declaration by  such person that the statement is made under the penalties of perjury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manner of payment. The penalty set forth in paragraph (a) of  this section shall be paid in the same manner as tax upon the issuance  of a notice and demand thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years of  the taxpayer for which the due date for filing returns (without  extension) occurs after December 31, 1988.  [T.D. 8292, 55 FR 9441, Mar. 14, 1990]</p>
