                                Sec. 779.354  Who may qualify as exempt 13(a)(2) or 13(a)(4)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 13(a)(2). An establishment engaged in selling lumber and building materials may qualify as an exempt retail or service establishment under section 13(a)(2) of the Act if it meets all the requirements of that exemption. It must appear that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The establishment is not in an enterprise described in section 3(s) of the Act or, if it is, its annual dollar volume of sales (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated) is less than $250,000; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> More than 50 percent of the establishment's annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services is made within the State in which the establishment is located; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 75 percent or more of the establishment's annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services (or of both) is made from sales which are not for resale and are recognized as retail sales of goods or services in the industry.
These requirements are further explained in Sec. Sec. 779.301 through 779.343.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 13(a)(4). An establishment which makes or processes lumber and building materials which it sells may qualify as an exempt establishment under section 13(a)(4) of the Act if it meets all the requirements (see Arnold v. Kanowsky, 361 U.S. 388) of that exemption. It must appear that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The establishment qualifies as an exempt retail establishment under section 13(a)(2) (see paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 779.350); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The establishment is recognized as a retail establishment in the industry (see Sec. 779.347 and paragraph (c) of this section); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The goods which such establishment makes or processes for sale are made or processed at the retail establishment which sells them (see Sec. 779.348); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> More than 85 percent of the annual dollar volume derived by the retail establishment from sales of goods so made or processed therein is made within the State in which the establishment is located (see Sec. Sec. 779.349, 779.339 through 779.341).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Establishments recognized as retail in the industry. An establishment which meets the requirements for exemption under section 13(a)(4) which are stated in paragraphs (b)(1), (3), and (4) of this section is recognized as retail establishment in the industry within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section if its annual dollar volume of sales of goods made or processed at the establishment does not exceed 50 percent of the annual dollar volume which it derives from sales that are recognized as retail and are not made for resale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establishments lacking a ``retail concept.'' The exemptions provided by sections 13(a)(2) and 13(a)(4) of the Act do not apply to establishments in an industry in which there is no traditional concept of retail selling or servicing (see Sec. 779.316), such as the establishment of a building contractor (see Sec. 779.317; Goldberg v. Dakota Flooring Co., 15 WH Cases 305), or a factory (see Sec. 779.347).</p>
