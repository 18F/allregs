                            <p class="depth0">Methods that may be used to determine pH or acidity for acidified  foods include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Potentiometric method for the determination of pH--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Principles. The term ``pH'' is used to designate the intensity or degree  of acidity. The value of pH, the logarithm of the reciprocal of the  hydrogen ion concentration in solution, is determined by measuring the  difference in potential between two electrodes immersed in a sample  solution. A suitable system consists of a potentiometer, a glass  electrode, and a reference electrode. A precise pH determination can be  made by making an electromotive force (emf) measurement of a standard  buffer solution whose pH is known, and then comparing that measurement  to an emf measurement of a sample of the solution to be tested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Instruments. The primary instrument for use in pH determination  is the pH meter or potentiometer. For most work, an instrument with a  direct-reading pH scale is necessary. Battery and line-operated  instruments are available commercially. If the line voltage is unstable,  line-operated instruments should be fitted with voltage regulators to  eliminate drifting of meter-scale readings. Batteries should be checked  frequently to ensure proper operation of battery operated instruments.  An instrument using an expanded unit scale or a digital readout system  is preferred since it allows more precise measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Electrodes. The typical pH meter is equipped with a glass  membrane electrode and a reference electrode or a single probe  combination electrode. Various types of electrodes designed for specific  uses are available. The most commonly used reference electrode is the  calomel electrode, which incorporates a salt bridge filled with  saturated potassium chloride solution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Care and use of electrodes. Calomel electrodes should be kept  filled with saturated potassium chloride solution or other solution  specified by the manufacturer because they may become damaged if they  are allowed to dry out. For best results, electrodes should be soaked in  buffer solution, distilled or deionized water, or other liquid specified  by the manufacturer for several hours before using and kept ready by  storing with tips immersed in distilled water or in buffer solution used  for standardization. Electrodes should be rinsed with water before  immersing in the standard buffers and rinsed with water or the solution  to be measured next between sample determinations. A lag in meter  response may indicate aging effects or fouling of the electrodes, and  cleaning and rejuvenation of the electrodes may be necessary and may be  accomplished by placing the electrodes in 0.1 molar sodium hydroxide  solution for 1 minute and then transferring them to 0.1 molar  hydrochloric acid solution for 1 minute. The cycle should be repeated  two times, ending with the electrodes in the acid solution. The  electrodes should then be thoroughly rinsed with water and blotted with  soft tissue before proceeding with the standardization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Temperature. To obtain accurate results, a uniform temperature  should be maintained for the electrodes, the standard buffer solutions,  and the samples. Tests should be made at a temperature between 20 and  30 C, the optimum being 25 C. Any temperature determinations made  without meter compensation may affect pH values. An automatic  temperature compensator may be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accuracy. The accuracy of most pH meters is stated to be  approximately 0.1 pH unit, and reproducibility is usually [0.05 pH unit  or less. Some meters permit the expansion of any pH unit range to cover  the entire scale and have an accuracy of approximately [0.01 pH unit and  a reproducibility of [0.005 pH units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> General procedure for determining pH. When operating an  instrument, the operator should use the manufacturer's instructions and  should observe the following techniques for pH determinations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Switch the instrument on and allow the electronic components to  warm up and stabilize before proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Standardize the instrument and electrodes with commercially  prepared standard 4.0 pH buffer or with freshly prepared 0.05 molar  potassium acid phthalate buffer solution prepared as outlined in  ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical  Chemists'' (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), section 50.007(c), under ``Buffer  Solutions for Calibration of pH Equipment--Official Final Action,''  which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC  INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD  20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this  material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/ federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. Note  the temperature of the buffer solution and set the temperature  compensator control at the observed temperature (room temperature is  near 25 C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rinse the electrodes with water and blot, but do not wipe,  with soft tissue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Immerse the tips in the buffer solution and take the pH  reading, allowing about 1 minute for the meter to stabilize. Adjust the  standardization control so that the meter reading corresponds to the pH  of the known buffer (for example, 4.0) for the temperature observed.  Rinse the electrodes with water and blot with soft tissue. Repeat  procedure with fresh portions of buffer solution until the instrument  remains in balance on two successive trials. To check the operation of  the pH meter, check the pH reading using another standard buffer such as  one having a   pH of 7.0, or check it with freshly prepared 0.025 molar phosphate  solution prepared as outlined in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section  50.007(e), which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this  incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this  section. Expanded scale pH meters may be checked with pH 3.0 or pH 5.0  standard buffers. Buffers and instruments can be further checked by  comparison with values obtained with a second properly standardized  instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Indicating electrodes may be checked for proper operation by  first using an acid buffer and then a base buffer. First standardize the  electrodes using a pH 4.0 buffer at or near 25 C. Standardization  control should be adjusted so that the meter reads exactly 4.0.  Electrodes should be rinsed with water, then blotted and immersed in a  pH 9.18 borax buffer prepared as outlined in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980),  section 50.007(f), which is incorporated by reference. The availability  of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of  this section. The pH reading should be within [0.3 units of the 9.18  value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The pH meter can be tested for proper operation by shorting the  glass and reference electrode inputs, thereby reducing the voltage to  zero. In some meters this shorting is done by switching the instrument  to standby, and in other instruments by use of a shorting strap. With  the instrument shorted out, standardization control should be turned  from one extreme to another. This operation should produce a deflection  greater than [1.5 pH unit from center scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Determining pH on samples. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adjust the temperature of the  sample to room temperature (25 C), and set the temperature compensator  control to the observed temperature. With some expanded scale  instruments, the sample temperature must be the same as the temperature  of the buffer solution used for the standardization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rinse and blot the electrodes. Immerse the electrodes in the  sample and take the pH reading, allowing 1 minute for the meter to  stabilize. Rinse and blot the electrodes and repeat on a fresh portion  of sample. Oil and grease from the samples may coat the electrodes;  therefore, it is advisable to clean and standardize the instrument  frequently. When oily samples cause fouling problems, it may become  necessary to rinse the electrodes with ethyl ether.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine two pH values on the well-mixed sample. These  readings should agree with one another to indicate that the sample is  homogeneous. Report values to the nearest 0.05 pH unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Preparation of samples. Some food products may consist of a  mixture of liquid and solid components that differ in acidity. Other  food products may be semisolid in character. The following are examples  of preparation procedures for pH testing for each of these categories:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Liquid and solid component mixtures. Drain the contents of the  container for 2 minutes on a U.S. standard No. 8 sieve (preferably  stainless steel) inclined at a 17- to 20-degree angle. Record weight of  the liquid and solid portions and retain each portion separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If the liquid contains sufficient oil to cause electrode  fouling, separate the layers with a separatory funnel and retain the  aqueous layer. The oil layer may be discarded. Adjust the temperature of  the aqueous layer to 25 C and determine its pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Remove the drained solids from the sieve, blend to a uniform  paste, adjust the temperature of the paste to 25 C and determine its  pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mix aliquots of solid and liquid fractions in the same ratio as  found in the original container and blend to a uniform consistency.  Adjust the temperature of the blend to 25 C and determine the  equilibriated pH. Alternatively, blend the entire contents of the  container to a uniform paste, adjust the temperature of the paste to 25  C, and determine the equilibriated pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Marinated oil products. Separate the oil from the solid  product. Blend the solid in a blender to a paste consistency; it may  become necessary to add a small amount of distilled water to some  samples to facilitate the blending. A small amount of added water will  not alter the pH of most   food products, but caution must be exercised concerning poorly buffered  foods. No more than 20 milliliters of distilled water should be added to  each 100 grams of product. Determine the pH by immersing electrodes in  the prepared paste after adjusting the temperature to 25 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Semisolid products. Food products of a semisolid consistency,  such as puddings, potato salad, etc., may be blended to a paste  consistency, and the pH may be determined on the prepared paste. If more  fluidity is required, 10 to 20 milliliters of distilled water may be  added to 100 grams of product. Adjust the temperature of the prepared  paste to 25 C and determine its pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special product mixtures. For special product mixtures such as  antipasto, pour off the oil, blend the remaining product to a paste, and  determine the pH of the blended paste. If more fluidity is required, add  10 to 20 milliliters of distilled water to each 100 grams of product and  blend. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 C and  determine its pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Process pH determination. Obtain sample portions of material for  pH determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For process liquids, adjust the temperature of the liquid to 25  C and determine the pH by immersing the electrodes in the liquid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Drain solid materials on a sieve and blend to a workable paste.  Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 C and determine its  pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If enough solid materials are available to make a paste, blend  representative aliquots of liquid and solid materials to a workable  paste. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 C and  determine the equilibrated pH. Alternatively, blend the entire contents  of the container to a uniform paste, adjust the temperature of the paste  to 25 C, and determine the equilibrated pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Colorimetric methods for the determination of pH. This method  may be used in lieu of the potentiometric method if the pH is 4.0 or  lower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Principle. The colorimetric method for pH involves the use of  indicator dyes in solutions that gradually change color over limited pH  ranges. An indicator that has the greatest color change at approximately  the pH of the sample being tested is selected. The pH is determined by  the color of the indicator when exposed to the sample under test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indicator solutions. Most indicator solutions are prepared as a  0.04 percent solution of the indicator dye in alcohol. In testing, a few  drops of indicator solution are added to 10-milliliter portions of the  sample solution. Colors should be compared using a bright background.  Approximate determinations can be made on white porcelain spot plates,  the test colors being compared thereon with a set of color standards.  More accurate colorimetric tests can be made using a comparator block  fitted with sets of tubes of standard indicator solutions of known pH.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indicator paper. A paper tape treated with indicator dye is  dipped into the sample solution. Depending upon the pH of the solution,  the tape will change color and an approximate pH can be determined by  comparison with a standard color chart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Titratable acidity. Acceptable methods for determining  titratable acidity are described in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section  22.060, under ``Titratable Acidity--Official Final Action,'' for  ``Indicator Method,'' and section 22.061 for ``Glass Electrode Method-- Official Final Action,'' which is incorporated by reference. The  availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph  (a)(4)(ii) of this section. The procedure for preparing and  standardizing the sodium hydroxide solution is described in the AOAC,  13th Ed. (1980), sections 50.032-50.035, under ``Sodium Hydroxide-- Official Final Action'' by the ``Standard Potassium Hydroxide Phthalate  Method,'' which is also incorporated by reference and available as set  forth in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
