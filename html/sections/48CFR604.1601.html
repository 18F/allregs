Uniform numbers  shall be assigned to all DOS procurement instruments, domestic and  overseas. The numbering system applies to all contracts, purchase  orders, and other related instruments, including solicitation documents  and delivery orders. This includes instruments executed by DOS  contracting officers on behalf of other federal agencies. It does not  include requisitions submitted to a contracting activity, or to  instruments awarded under Federal assistance arrangements, e.g., grants,  cooperative agreements, and loans. Numbers shall be placed in  appropriate spaces on government forms and appear on all documentation  intended to support official contract files.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Responsibility. Heads of contracting activities are responsible  for enforcing compliance with the uniform numbering system. Heads of  contracting activities shall develop and maintain a system for assigning  and recording contract numbers that conforms to this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Instrument identification numbers. A 13-character ``alpha- numeric'' designator shall be assigned to all DOS procurement  instruments. Positions (beginning at the left) one through six shall  identify the purchasing office; positions seven and eight, the fiscal  year in which the number is assigned; position nine, a symbol  designating a type of procurement instrument; and positions ten through  thirteen, a four-position serial number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The first six positions shall commence with ``S'' to designate a  DOS-issued contract.

For example, the ``1000'' series may be reserved for Bureau of Consular  Affairs requirements (domestic), or the ``1000'' series may be reserved  for Economic section requirements (overseas). Use of discrete series is  appropriate generally for activities handling large numbers of  transactions and can provide useful management information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Solicitation amendment and contract modification numbers.  Solicitation amendments are to be numbered sequentially, beginning with  the alpha designator ``A,'' e.g., A001.
