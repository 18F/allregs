The official documentation for the position must establish that it satisfies the requirements defined in Sec. 842.1002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A determination under Sec. 842.1003(b) must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an employee is in a position not subject to the one-half percent higher withholding rate of 5 U.S.C. 8422(a)(3), and the employee does not, within 6 months of entering the position formally and in writing seek a determination from the employing agency that his or her service is properly covered by the higher withholding rate, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee was unaware of his or her status or was prevented by cause beyond his or her control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed.</p>
