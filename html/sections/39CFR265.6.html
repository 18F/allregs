                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Records available to the public on request--(1) General. Postal Service records are available for inspection or copying at the request of any person, in accordance with the provisions of this part, except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, including but not limited to paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. Certain categories of records of particular interest are available on a continuing basis as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this section and are listed in a public index as provided in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section. Access to other records may be requested on an individual basis in accordance with the procedures provided in Sec. 265.7. Official records which are maintained on an electronic storage medium will normally be made available, in accordance with this part, as an exact duplicate of the requested original in a form readable by the human eye, such as a computer print-out. On request, records will be provided in a different form or format if they are maintained in the requested form or format or if they can be readily reproduced in the requested form or format.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Opinions. All final opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases by the Judicial Officer and Administrative Law Judges, all final determinations pursuant to section 404(b) of title 39, United States Code, to close or consolidate a post office, or to disapprove a proposed closing or consolidation, all advisory opinions concerning the private express statutes issued pursuant to 39 CFR 310.6, and all bid protest decisions are on file and available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library and, if created on or after November 1, 1996, also at the Postal Service's world wide web site identified at Sec. 265.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Administrative manuals and instructions to staff. The manuals, instructions, and other publications of the Postal Service that affect members of the public are available through the Headquarters Library and at many post offices and other postal facilities. Those which are available to the public but are not listed for sale may be inspected in the Headquarters Library, at any postal facility which maintains a copy, or, if created on or after November 1, 1996, through the world wide web site identified at Sec. 265.5. Copies of publications which are not listed as for sale or as available free of charge may be obtained by paying a fee in accordance with Sec. 265.9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Previously released records. Records processed and disclosed after March 31, 1997, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, which the Postal Service determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records, are available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library. Any such records created by the Postal Service on or after November 1, 1996, also will be available at the Postal Service's world wide web site identified at Sec. 265.5. Records described in this paragraph that were not created by, or on behalf of, the Postal Service generally will not be available at the world wide web site. Records will be available in the form in which they were originally disclosed, except to the extent that they contain information that is not appropriate for public disclosure and may be withheld pursuant to this section. Any deleted material will be marked and the applicable exemption(s) indicated in accordance with Sec. 265.7(d)(3). A general index of the

records described in this paragraph is available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library. [Beginning on or before December 31, 1999, the index also will be available at the Postal Service's world wide web site.]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Public index. (i) A public index is maintained in the Headquarters Library and at the world wide web site of all final opinions and orders made by the Postal Service in the adjudication of cases, Postal Service policy statements which may be relied on as precedents in the disposition of cases, administrative staff manuals and instructions that affect the public, and other materials which the Postal Service elects to index and make available to the public on request in the manner set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The index contains references to matters issued after July 4, 1967, and may reference matters issued prior to that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any person may arrange for the inspection of any matter in the public index in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 265.7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Copies of the public index and of matters listed in the public index may be purchased through the Headquarters Library with payment of fees as listed in the index or as provided in Sec. 265.9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Materials listed in the public index that were created on or after November 1, 1996, will also be available in electronic format at the Postal Service's world wide web site at http://www.usps.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Listings of employees' names. Upon written request, the Postal Service will, to the extent required by law, provide a listing of postal employees working at a particular postal facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Records not subject to mandatory public disclosure. Certain classes of records are exempt from mandatory disclosure under exemptions contained in the Freedom of Information Act and in section 410(c) of title 39, U.S.C. The Postal Service will exercise its discretion, in accordance with the policy stated in Sec. 265.2, as implemented by instructions issued by the Records Office with the approval of the General Counsel in determining whether the public interest is served by the inspection or copying of records that are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Postal Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Trade secrets, or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, obtained from any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed. This class includes, but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Information pertaining to methods of handling valuable registered mail.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Records of money orders, except as provided in R900 of the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Technical information concerning postage meters and prototypes submitted for Postal Service approval prior to leasing to mailers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Reports of market surveys conducted by or under contract in behalf of the Postal Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Records indicating rural carrier lines of travel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Records compiled within the Postal Service which would be of potential benefit to persons or firms in economic competition with the Postal Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Information which, if publicly disclosed, could materially increase procurement costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Information which, if publicly disclosed, could compromise testing or examination materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interagency or internal memoranda or letters that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the Postal Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Reports and memoranda of consultants or independent contractors, except to the extent they would be required to be disclosed if prepared within the Postal Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Files personal in nature, including medical and personnel files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Information prepared for use in connection with proceedings under chapter 36 of title 39, U.S.C., relating to rate, classification, and service changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Information prepared for use in connection with the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements under chapter 12 of title 39, U.S.C., or minutes of, or notes kept during, negotiating sessions conducted under such chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Other matter specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. (1) Investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes, whether or not considered closed, are exempt by statute from mandatory disclosure except to the extent otherwise available by law to a party other than the Postal Service, 39 U.S.C. 410(c)(6). As a matter of policy, however, the Postal Service will normally make records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes available upon request unless the production of these records:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority (such as the Postal Inspection Service) in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in Sec. 265.6(c)(1)(i), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is reason to believe that,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the Postal Service may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcement agency (such as the Postal Inspection Service) under an informant's name or personal identifier are requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier, the records may be treated as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Authority to disclose records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to persons outside the Postal Service must be obtained from the Chief Postal Inspector, U.S. Postal Service, Washington, DC 20260-2100, or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure of names and addresses of customers. Upon request, the names and addresses of specifically identified Postal Service customers will be made available only as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Change of address.

When using the standard format on the submitter's own letterhead, the standard format must be used in its entirety. The warning statement and certification specifically must be included immediately before the signature block. If the request lacks any of the required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return it to the requester specifying the deficiency.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The term pro se means that a party is not represented by an attorney but by himself or herself.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In compliance with a subpoena or court order, except that change of address or boxholder information which is not otherwise subject to disclosure under these regulations may be disclosed only pursuant to a court order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To a law enforcement agency, for oral requests made through the Inspection Service, but only after the Inspection Service has confirmed that the information is needed in the course of a criminal investigation.

The Postal Service requires government agencies to use the format appearing at the end of this section when requesting the verification of a customer's current address or a customer's new mailing address. If the request lacks any of the required information or a proper signature, the postmaster will return the request to the agency, specifying the deficiency in the space marked ``OTHER''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Business/Residence location. If the location of a residence or a place of business is known to a Postal Service employee, whether as a result of official duties or otherwise, the employee may, but need not, disclose the location or give directions to it.
