The bovine and ovine parts that may not be imported include all parts of the head, feet, hump, hooves, and internal organs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All bone and visually identifiable blood clots and lymphoid tissue have been removed from the meat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The meat has not been in contact with meat from regions other than those listed as free of foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest under Sec. 94.1(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The meat comes from carcasses that were allowed to maturate at 40 to 50 [deg]F (4 to 10 [deg]C) for a minimum of 24 hours after slaughter and that reached a pH below 6.0 in the loin muscle at the end of the maturation period. Measurements for pH must be taken at the middle of both longissimus dorsi muscles. Any carcass in which the pH does not reach less than 6.0 may be allowed to maturate an additional 24 hours and be retested, and, if the carcass still has

not reached a pH of less than 6.0 after 48 hours, the meat from the carcass may not be exported to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An authorized veterinary official of the Government of Uruguay certifies on the foreign meat inspection certificate that the above conditions have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The establishment in which the bovines and sheep are slaughtered allows periodic on-site evaluation and subsequent inspection of its facilities, records, and operations by an APHIS representative.
