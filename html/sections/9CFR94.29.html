Measurements for pH must be taken at the middle of both longissimus dorsi muscles. Any carcass in which the pH does not reach less than 6.0 may be allowed to maturate an additional 24 hours and be retested, and, if the carcass still has not reached a pH of less than 6.0 after 48 hours, the meat from the carcass may not be exported to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An authorized veterinary official of the government of the exporting region certifies on the foreign meat inspection certificate that the above conditions have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The establishment in which the bovines and sheep are slaughtered allows periodic on-site evaluation and subsequent inspection of its facilities, records, and operations by an APHIS representative.
