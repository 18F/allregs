                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Waivers to certification requirements may be approved in certain situations. Waivers for additional time to complete certification requirements are not necessary for the first year following an assignment to a major IT or construction capital investment and for 2 years following an assignment to a non-major capital investment. For waivers beyond those periods (for up to 1 additional year), the HHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) (for IT programs and projects) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Facilities Management and Policy (DASFMP) (for construction programs and projects) are delegated authority to approve waiver requests. The HHS CAO is the only individual authorized to approve waiver requests for additional time beyond the initial 1-year waiver period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval of a waiver request does not relieve an individual from meeting the certification requirements. Also, unlike FAC-P/PM certifications, waivers issued by other Federal departments and agencies do not transfer to HHS, since a waiver is agency-specific.</p>
