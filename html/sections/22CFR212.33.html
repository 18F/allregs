Any such written request and its envelope must be plainly  marked ``FOIA Request.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only signed original (as opposed to electronically transmitted)  requests are acceptable for procedures pursuant to paragraphs (a) and  (b) of this section. Telephoned requests, or in-person requests other  than to the Public Reading Room, cannot be accepted. If a written  request not properly marked ``FOIA Request'' on both the letter and  envelope is thereby delayed in reaching the Chief, Office of Customer  Outreach and Oversight Staff, such request will not be deemed received  by USAID until actually received by that official. In the event of such  a delay, the person making the request will be furnished a notice of the  effective date of receipt.</p>
