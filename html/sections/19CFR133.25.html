                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Articles subject to the restrictions of Sec. Sec. 133.22 and 133.23 shall be detained for 30 days from the date on which the merchandise is presented for Customs examination. The importer shall be notified of the decision to detain within 5 days of the decision that such restrictions apply. The importer may, during the 30-day period, establish that any of the circumstances described in Sec. 133.22(c) or Sec. 133.23(d) are applicable. Extensions of the 30-day time period may be freely granted for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of detention and disclosure of information. From the time merchandise is presented for Customs examination until the time a notice of detention is issued, Customs may disclose to the owner of the trademark or trade name any of the following information in order to obtain assistance in determining whether an imported article bears an infringing trademark or trade name. Once a notice of detention is issued, Customs shall disclose to the owner of the trademark or trade name the following information, if available, within 30 days, excluding weekends and holidays, of the date of detention:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The date of importation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The port of entry;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the merchandise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The quantity involved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The country of origin of the merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Samples available to the trademark or trade name owner. At any time following presentation of the merchandise for Customs examination, but prior to seizure, Customs may provide a sample of the suspect merchandise to the owner of the trademark or trade name for examination or testing to assist in determining whether the article imported bears an infringing trademark or trade name. To obtain a sample under this section, the trademark/trade name owner must furnish Customs a bond in the form and amount specified by the port director, conditioned to hold the United States, its officers and employees, and the importer or owner of the imported article harmless from any loss or damage resulting from the furnishing of a sample by Customs to the trademark owner. Customs may demand the return of the sample at any time. The owner must return the sample to Customs upon demand or at the conclusion of the examination or testing. In the event that the sample is damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the possession of the trademark or trade name owner, the owner shall, in lieu of return of the sample, certify to Customs that: ``The sample described as [insert description] and provided pursuant to 19 CFR 133.25(c) was (damaged/destroyed/lost) during examination or testing for trademark infringement.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form of notice. Notice of detention of articles found subject to the restrictions of Sec. 133.22 or Sec. 133.23 shall be given the importer in writing.</p>
