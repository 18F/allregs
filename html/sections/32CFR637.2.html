                            <p class="depth0">Only those matters requiring investigative development will be  referred to the MPI for investigation. Provost marshals will develop  procedures to determine which incidents will be referred to the MPI for  completion and which will be retained and completed by uniformed MP  personnel. Except as otherwise provided, MPI and DAC detectives/ investigators will normally be employed in the following investigations:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Offenses for which the maximum punishment listed in the Table of  Maximum Punishment, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 2002 is  confinement for 1 year or less. Provisions of the Federal Assimilative  Crimes Act will also be considered when assigning cases to MPI. The same  punishment criteria apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Property-related offenses when the value is less than $1,000  provided the property is not of a sensitive nature, such as government  firearms, ammunition, night vision devices, or controlled substances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Offenses involving use and/or possession of non-narcotic  controlled substances when the amounts are indicative of personal use  only. Military police will coordinate with the local USACIDC element in  making determinations of ``personal use''. MPI and DAC detectives/ investigators may be employed in joint MPI/USACIDC drug suppression  teams; however, the conduct of such operations and activities remain the  responsibility of USACIDC. When employed under USACIDC supervision, MPI  and DAC detectives/investigators may also be utilized to make controlled  buys of suspected controlled substances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Activities required for the security and protection of persons  and property under Army control, to include support of Armed Forces  Disciplinary Control Boards as prescribed in AR 190-24. If MPI detect a  crime-conducive condition during the course of an investigation, the  appropriate physical security activity will be promptly notified. Crime- conducive conditions will also be identified in military police reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Allegations against MP personnel, when not within the  investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Offenses committed by juveniles, when not within the  investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Gang or hate crime related activity, when not within the  investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.</p>
