                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An eligible person, who desires medical or health care under this subpart or any person acting on behalf thereof, shall submit an application to the Office of Medical Services, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520 (hereafter referred to as the ``Office''). The applicant shall supply all relevant information, including insurance information, requested by the Director of the Office.

The Office will authorize care, or payment for care when it determines the criteria of such section are met. Authorization shall include a determination as to the necessity and reasonableness of medical or health care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Office will refer applicants eligible for benefits under other Government health programs to the Government agency administering those programs. Any portion of authorized care not provided or paid for under another Government program will be reimbursed under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eligible persons may obtain authorized care from any licensed facility or health care provider of their choice approved by the Office.
