                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Separate motions generally are discouraged in ODRA bid protests. Counsel and parties are encouraged to incorporate any such motions in their respective agency responses or comments. Parties and counsel are encouraged to attempt to resolve typical motions issues through the ODRA ADR process. The ODRA may rule on any non-dispositive motion, where appropriate and necessary, after providing an opportunity for briefing on the motion by all affected parties. Unjustifiable, inappropriate use of motions may result in the imposition of sanctions. Where appropriate, a party may request by dispositive motion to the ODRA, or the ODRA may recommend or order, that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The protest, or any count or portion of a protest, be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, timeliness, or standing to pursue the protest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The protest, or any count or portion of a protest, be dismissed, if frivolous or without basis in fact or law, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be had;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A summary decision be issued with respect to the protest, or any count or portion of a protest, if there are no material facts in dispute and a party is entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In connection with consideration of possible dismissal or summary decision, the ODRA shall consider any material facts in dispute, in a light most favorable to the party against whom the dismissal or summary decision would operate and draw all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Either upon motion by a party or on its own initiative, the ODRA may, at any time, exercise its discretion to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recommend to the Administrator dismissal or the issuance of a summary decision with respect to the entire protest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dismiss the entire protest or issue a summary decision with respect to the entire protest, if delegated that authority by the Administrator; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dismiss or issue a summary decision with respect to any count or portion of a protest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A dismissal or summary decision regarding the entire protest by either the Administrator, or the ODRA by delegation, shall be construed as a final agency order. A dismissal or summary decision that does not resolve all counts or portions of a protest shall not constitute a final agency order, unless and until such dismissal or decision is incorporated or otherwise adopted in a decision by the Administrator (or the ODRA, by delegation) regarding the entire protest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prior to recommending or entering either a dismissal or a summary decision, either in whole or in part, the ODRA shall afford all parties against whom the dismissal or summary decision is to be entered the opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal or summary decision.</p>
