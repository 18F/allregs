                                Sec. 1620.15  Jobs requiring equal skill in performance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The jobs to which the equal pay standard is  applicable are jobs requiring equal skill in their performance. Where  the amount or degree of skill required to perform one job is  substantially greater than that required to perform another job, the  equal pay standard cannot apply even though the jobs may be equal in all  other respects. Skill includes consideration of such factors as  experience, training, education, and ability. It must be measured in  terms of the performance requirements of the job. If an employee must  have essentially the same skill in order to perform either of two jobs,  the jobs will qualify under the EPA as jobs the performance of which  requires equal skill, even though the employee in one of the jobs may  not exercise the required skill as frequently or during as much of his  or her working time as the employee in the other job. Possession of a  skill not needed to meet the requirements of the job cannot be  considered in making a determination regarding equality of skill. The  efficiency of the employee's performance in the job is not in itself an  appropriate factor to consider in evaluating skill.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comparing skill requirements of jobs. As a simple illustration  of the principle of equal skill, suppose that a man and a woman have  jobs classified as administrative assistants. Both jobs require them to  spend two-thirds of their   working time facilitating and supervising support-staff duties, and the  remaining one-third of their time in diversified tasks, not necessarily  the same. Since there is no difference in the skills required for the  vast majority of their work, whether or not these jobs require equal  skill in performance will depend upon the nature of the work performed  during the latter period to meet the requirements of the jobs.</p>
