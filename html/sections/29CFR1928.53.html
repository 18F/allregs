                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish the test  and performance requirements for a protective enclosure designed for  wheel-type agricultural tractors to minimize the frequency and severity  of operator injury resulting from accidental upset. General requirements  for the protection of operators are specified in 29 CFR 1928.51.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Types of tests. All protective enclosures for wheel-type  agricultural tractors shall be of a model that has been tested as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Laboratory test. A laboratory energy-absorption test, either  static or dynamic, under repeatable and controlled loading, to permit  analysis of the protective enclosure for compliance with the performance  requirements of this standard; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Field-upset test. A field-upset test under controlled  conditions, both to the side and rear, to verify the effectiveness of  the protective system under actual dynamic conditions. This test may be  omitted when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The analysis of the protective-frame static-energy absorption  test results indicates that both FERis and FERir (as defined in  paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) exceed 1.15; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The analysis of the protective-frame dynamic-energy absorption  test results indicates that the frame can withstand an impact 15 percent  greater than the impact it is required to withstand for the tractor  weight as shown in Figure C-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Description. A protective enclosure is a structure comprising a  frame and/   or enclosure mounted to the tractor. A typical enclosure is shown in  Figure C-12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Test procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tractor weight used shall  be that of the heaviest tractor model on which the protective enclosure  is to be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each test required under this section shall be performed on a  protective enclosure with new structural members. Mounting connections  of the same design shall be used during each test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Instantaneous deflection shall be measured and recorded for  each segment of the test; see paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section for  permissible deflections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The seat-reference point (``SRP'') in Figure C-14 is that point  where the vertical line that is tangent to the most forward point at the  longitudinal seat centerline of the seat back, and the horizontal line  that is tangent to the highest point of the seat cushion, intersect in  the longitudinal seat section. The seat-reference point shall be  determined with the seat unloaded and adjusted to the highest and most  rearward position provided for seated operations of the tractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When the centerline of the seat is off the longitudinal center,  the protective-enclosure loading shall be on the side with least space  between the centerline of the seat and the protective enclosure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Low-temperature characteristics of the protective enclosure or  its material shall be demonstrated as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Rear input energy tests (static, dynamic, or field-upset) need  not be performed on enclosures mounted to tractors having four driven  wheels and more than one-half their unballasted weight on the front  wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Accuracy table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Measurements                           Accuracy ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Deflection of the enclosure, in.

(1,032 sq. cm) in size, with  the largest dimension no greater than 27   in. (686 mm). The load shall be applied to the upper extremity of the  structure at the point that is midway between the centerline of the  protective enclosure and the inside of the protective structure. When no  structural cross member exists at the rear of the enclosure, a  substitute test beam that does not add strength to the structure may be  used to complete this test procedure. The test shall be stopped when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The strain energy absorbed by the structure is equal to or  greater than the required input energy Eir; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deflection of the structure exceeds the allowable deflection  (see paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The structure load limit occurs before the allowable deflection  is reached in rear load (see Figure C-5);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Using data obtained in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section,  construct the L-D diagram for rear loads as shown in Figure C-5;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Calculate Eir;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Calculate FERir;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> When the protective-frame structures are an integral part of the  enclosure, apply the side load according to Figure C-13, and record L  and D simultaneously.

(1,032 sq. cm) in  size, with the largest dimension no greater than 27 in. (686 mm). Side- load application shall be at a 90[deg] angle to the centerline of the  vehicle. The center of the side-load application shall be located  between point k, 24 in. (610 mm) forward of the seat-reference point,  and point l, 12 in. (305 mm) rearward of the seat-reference point, to  best use the structural strength (see Figure C-13). This side load shall  be applied to the longitudinal side farthest from the point of rear-load  application. The test shall be stopped when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The strain energy absorbed by the structure is equal to or  greater than the required input energy Eis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deflection of the structure exceeds the allowable deflection  (see paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The structure load limit occurs before the allowable deflection  is reached in side load (see Figure C-5);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Using data obtained in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(F) of this section,  construct the L-D diagram for the side load as shown in Figure C-5;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Calculate FERis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Calculate FERir.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dynamic test procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following test conditions shall  be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The protective enclosure and tractor shall be tested at the  weight defined by 29 CFR 1928.51(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The dynamic loading shall be accomplished by using a 4,410-lb  (2,000-kg) weight acting as a pendulum. The impact face of the weight  shall be 27 [1 in. by 27 [1 in. (686 [25 mm by 686 [25 mm), and shall be  constructed so that its center of gravity is within 1.0 in. (25.4 mm) of  its geometric center. The weight shall be suspended from a pivot point  18 to 22 ft (5.5 to 6.7 m) above the point of impact on the enclosure,  and shall be conveniently and safely adjustable for height (see Figure  C-6);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For each phase of testing, the tractor shall be restrained from  moving when the dynamic load is applied. The restraining members shall  have strength no less than, and elasticity no greater than, that of  0.50-in. (12.7-mm) steel cable. Points of attachment for the restraining  members shall be located an appropriate distance behind the rear axle  and in front of the front axle to provide a 15[deg] to 30[deg] angle  between the restraining cable and the horizontal. For impact from the  rear, the restraining cables shall be located in the plane in which the  center of gravity of the pendulum will swing, or alternatively, two sets  of symmetrically located cables may be used at lateral locations on the  tractor. For the impact from the side, restraining cables shall be used  as shown in Figures C-15 and C-16;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The front and rear wheel-tread settings, when adjustable, shall  be at the position nearest to halfway between the minimum and maximum  settings obtainable on the vehicle. When only two settings are  obtainable, the minimum setting shall be used. The tires shall have no  liquid ballast, and shall be inflated to the maximum operating pressure  recommended by the manufacturer. With specified tire inflation, the  restraining cable shall be tightened to provide tire deflection of 6   to 8 percent of nominal tire section width. After the vehicle is  retrained properly, a wooden beam no smaller than 6-in. x 6-in. (150-mm  x 150-mm) cross-section shall be driven tightly against the appropriate  wheels and clamped. For the test to the side, an additional wooden beam  shall be placed as a prop against the wheel nearest the operator's  station, and shall be secured to the base so that it is held tightly  against the wheel rim during impact. The length of this beam shall be  chosen so that it is at an angle of 25[deg] to 40[deg] to the horizontal  when it is positioned against the wheel rim. It shall have a length 20  to 25 times its depth, and a width two to three times its depth (see  Figures C-15 and C-16);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Means shall be provided for indicating the maximum instantaneous  deflection along the line of impact. A simple friction device is  illustrated in Figure C-4;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> No repair or adjustments shall be made during the test; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> When any cables, props, or blocking shift or break during the  test, the test shall be repeated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> H = Vertical height of the center of gravity of a 4,410-lb  (2,000-kg) weight in in.

The weight shall be pulled back so  that the height of its center of gravity above the point of impact is: H  = 4.92 + 0.00190 W (H' = 125 + 0.107 W') (see Figure C-7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The test procedures shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The enclosure structure shall be evaluated by imposing dynamic  loading from the rear, followed by a load to the side on the same  enclosure structure. The pendulum swinging from the height determined by  paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section shall be used to impose the dynamic  load. The position of the pendulum shall be so selected that the initial  point of impact on the protective structure is in line with the arc of  travel of the center of gravity of the pendulum. When a quick-release  mechanism is used, it shall not influence the attitude of the block;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Impact at rear. The tractor shall be restrained properly  according to paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(C) and (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section.  The tractor shall be positioned with respect to the pivot point of the  pendulum so that the pendulum is 20[deg] from the vertical prior to  impact as shown in Figure C-15. The impact shall be applied to the upper  extremity of the enclosure structure at the point that is midway between  the centerline of the enclosure structure and the inside of the  protective structure. When no structural cross member exists at the rear  of the enclosure structure, a substitute test beam that does not add to  the strength of the structure may be used to complete the test  procedure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> and (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section. The center  point of impact shall be at the upper extremity of the enclosure at a  90[deg] angle to the centerline of the vehicle, and located between a  point k, 24 in. (610 mm) forward of the seat-reference point, and a  point l, 12 in. (305 mm) rearward of the seat-reference point, to best  use the structural strength (see Figure C-13).
