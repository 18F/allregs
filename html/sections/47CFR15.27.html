                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equipment marketed to a consumer must be capable of complying  with the necessary regulations in the configuration in which the  equipment is marketed. Where special accessories, such as shielded  cables and/or special connectors, are required to enable an  unintentional or intentional radiator to comply with the emission limits  in this part, the equipment must be marketed with, i.e., shipped and  sold with, those special accessories. However, in lieu of shipping or  packaging the special accessories with the unintentional or intentional  radiator, the responsible party may employ other methods of ensuring  that the special accessories are provided to the consumer, without  additional charge, at the time of purchase. Information detailing any  alternative method used to supply the special accessories shall be  included in the application for a grant of equipment authorization or  retained in the verification records, as appropriate. The party  responsible for the equipment, as detailed in Sec. 2.909 of this  chapter, shall ensure that these special accessories are provided with  the equipment. The instruction manual for such devices shall include  appropriate instructions on the first page of the text concerned with  the installation of the device that these special accessories must be  used with the device. It is the responsibility of the user to use the  needed special accessories supplied with the equipment. In cases where  the manual is provided only in a form other than paper, such as on a  computer disk or over the Internet, the information required by this  section may be included in the manual in that alternative form, provided  the user can reasonably be expected to have the capability to access  information in that form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a device requiring special accessories is installed by or  under the supervision of the party marketing the device, it is the  responsibility of that party to install the equipment using the special  accessories. For equipment requiring professional installation, it is  not necessary for the responsible party to market the special  accessories with the equipment. However, the need to use the special  accessories must be detailed in the instruction manual, and it is the  responsibility of the installer to provide and to install the required  accessories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Accessory items that can be readily obtained from multiple  retail outlets are not considered to be special accessories and are not  required to be marketed with the equipment. The manual included with the  equipment must specify what additional components or accessories are  required to be used in order to ensure compliance with this part, and it  is the responsibility of the user to provide and use those components  and accessories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The resulting system, including any accessories or components  marketed with the equipment, must comply with the regulations.
