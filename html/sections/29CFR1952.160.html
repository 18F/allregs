                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> The plan identifies the Bureau of Labor as the State agency designated to administer the plan throughout the State. Its responsibilities include both occupational safety and occupational health, the latter on a developmental basis. The plan defines the covered occupational safety and health issues as defined by the Secretary of Labor in 29 CFR 1902.2(c)(i). Under existing occupational safety and health legislation, effective July 1, 1972, Iowa has adopted as interim standards all the occupational safety and health standards and amendments thereto which had been promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, except those found in 29 CFR parts 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918 (Ship repairing, ship building, ship breaking and longshoring). Hearings have been held on the adoption, as permanent standards, of the standards in 29 CFR parts 1910 and 1926. Under its existing legislation, the Bureau of Labor has exercised statewide inspection authority to enforce State standards which are identical to Federal standards. The legislation covers all employers including the State and its political subdivisions and gives the Iowa Bureau of Labor full authority to administer and enforce all laws, rules, and orders protecting employee safety and health in all places of employment in the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan identifies the Bureau of Labor as the State agency designated to administer the plan throughout the State.
