                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adequacy of documentation. The agency official shall ensure that  a determination, finding, or agreement under the procedures in this  subpart is supported by sufficient documentation to enable any reviewing  parties to understand its basis. The agency official shall provide such  documentation to the extent permitted by law and within available funds.  When an agency official is conducting phased identification or  evaluation under this subpart, the documentation standards regarding  description of historic properties may be applied flexibly. If the  Council, or the SHPO/THPO when the Council is not involved, determines  the applicable documentation standards are not met, the Council or the  SHPO/THPO, as appropriate, shall notify the agency official and specify  the information needed to meet the standard. At the request of the  agency official or any of the consulting parties, the Council shall  review any disputes over whether documentation standards are met and  provide its views to the agency official and the consulting parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Format. The agency official may use documentation prepared to  comply   with other laws to fulfill the requirements of the procedures in this  subpart, if that documentation meets the standards of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Confidentiality--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authority to withhold information. Section  304 of the act provides that the head of a Federal agency or other  public official receiving grant assistance pursuant to the act, after  consultation with the Secretary, shall withhold from public disclosure  information about the location, character, or ownership of a historic  property when disclosure may cause a significant invasion of privacy;  risk harm to the historic property; or impede the use of a traditional  religious site by practitioners. When the head of a Federal agency or  other public official has determined that information should be withheld  from the public pursuant to these criteria, the Secretary, in  consultation with such Federal agency head or official, shall determine  who may have access to the information for the purposes of carrying out  the act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consultation with the Council. When the information in question  has been developed in the course of an agency's compliance with this  part, the Secretary shall consult with the Council in reaching  determinations on the withholding and release of information. The  Federal agency shall provide the Council with available information,  including views of the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations, related to the confidentiality concern. The Council shall  advise the Secretary and the Federal agency within 30 days of receipt of  adequate documentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other authorities affecting confidentiality. Other Federal laws  and program requirements may limit public access to information  concerning an undertaking and its effects on historic properties. Where  applicable, those authorities shall govern public access to information  developed in the section 106 process and may authorize the agency  official to protect the privacy of non-governmental applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Finding of no historic properties affected. Documentation shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the undertaking, specifying the Federal  involvement, and its area of potential effects, including photographs,  maps, drawings, as necessary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the steps taken to identify historic  properties, including, as appropriate, efforts to seek information  pursuant to Sec. 800.4(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The basis for determining that no historic properties are  present or affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Finding of no adverse effect or adverse effect. Documentation  shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the undertaking, specifying the Federal  involvement, and its area of potential effects, including photographs,  maps, and drawings, as necessary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the steps taken to identify historic  properties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the affected historic properties, including  information on the characteristics that qualify them for the National  Register;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the undertaking's effects on historic  properties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An explanation of why the criteria of adverse effect were found  applicable or inapplicable, including any conditions or future actions  to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Copies or summaries of any views provided by consulting parties  and the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Memorandum of agreement. When a memorandum of agreement is filed  with the Council, the documentation shall include, any substantive  revisions or additions to the documentation provided the Council  pursuant to Sec. 800.6(a)(1), an evaluation of any measures considered  to avoid or minimize the undertaking's adverse effects and a summary of  the views of consulting parties and the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Requests for comment without a memorandum of agreement.  Documentation shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description and evaluation of any alternatives or mitigation  measures that the agency official proposes to resolve the undertaking's  adverse effects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of any reasonable alternatives or mitigation  measures that were considered but not chosen, and the reasons for their  rejection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copies or summaries of any views submitted to the agency  official concerning the adverse effects of the undertaking on historic  properties and alternatives to reduce or avoid those effects; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any substantive revisions or additions to the documentation  provided the Council pursuant to Sec. 800.6(a)(1).</p>
