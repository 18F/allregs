OFHEO will classify each Enterprise according to the capital classifications in Sec. 1777.20(a) or Sec. 1777.20(c) on at least a quarterly basis. OFHEO may classify an Enterprise according to the capital classifications in Sec. 1777.20(a) or Sec. 1777.20(c), or reclassify an Enterprise as set out in Sec. 1777.20(a)(5), Sec. 1777.20(c)(5), Sec. 1777.23(c), or Sec. 1777.23(h), at such other times as OFHEO deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of proposed capital classification.

The Enterprise may submit a response to OFHEO containing information for OFHEO's consideration in classifying or reclassifying the Enterprise.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Enterprise may, within thirty calendar days from receipt of a notice of proposed capital classification, submit a response to OFHEO, unless OFHEO determines the condition of the Enterprise requires a shorter period or the Enterprise consents to a shorter period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Enterprise's response period may be extended for up to an additional thirty calendar days if OFHEO determines there is good cause for such extension.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Enterprise's failure to submit a response during the response period (as extended or shortened, if applicable) shall waive any right of the Enterprise to comment on or object to the proposed capital classification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Classification determination and written notice of capital classification. After the Enterprise has submitted its response under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the response period (as extended or shortened, if applicable) has expired, whichever occurs first, OFHEO will make its determination of the Enterprise's capital classification, taking

into consideration such relevant information as is provided by the Enterprise in its response, if any, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. OFHEO will provide the Enterprise with a written notice of capital classification, which shall include a description of the basis for OFHEO's determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Timing. OFHEO may, in its discretion, issue a notice of proposed capital classification to an Enterprise at any time. If a notice of proposed classification is pending (under the process set out in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section) at that time, OFHEO may, in its discretion, specify whether the subsequent notice of proposed capital classification supersedes the pending notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Developments warranting possible change to capital classification--(1) Notice to OFHEO. An Enterprise shall promptly provide OFHEO with written notice of any material development that would result in the Enterprise's core or total capital to fall to a point causing the Enterprise to be placed in a lower capital classification than the capital classification assigned to the Enterprise in its most recent notice of capital classification from OFHEO, or than is proposed to be assigned in the Enterprise's most recent notice of proposed capital classification from OFHEO. The Enterprise shall deliver such notice to OFHEO no later than ten calendar days after the Enterprise becomes aware of such development.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice to OFHEO.
