If the evidence in the hearing record  supports a finding in favor of you and all the parties on every issue,  the administrative law judge may issue a hearing decision based on a  preponderance of the evidence without holding an oral hearing. The  notice of the decision will state that you have the right to an oral  hearing and to examine the evidence on which the administrative law  judge based the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Parties do not wish to appear. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The administrative law judge  may decide a case on the record and not conduct an oral hearing if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You and all the parties indicate in writing that you do not wish  to appear before the administrative law judge at an oral hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You live outside the United States, you do not inform us that  you wish to appear, and there are no other parties who wish to appear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When an oral hearing is not held, the administrative law judge  shall make a record of the material evidence. The record will include  the applications, written statements, certificates, reports, affidavits,  and other documents that were used in making the determination under  review and any additional evidence you or any other party to the hearing  present in writing. The decision of the administrative law judge must be  based on this record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Case remanded for a revised determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  administrative law judge may remand a case to the appropriate component  of our office for a revised determination if there is reason to believe  that the revised determination would be fully favorable to you. This  could happen if the administrative law judge receives new and material  evidence or if there is a change in the law that permits the favorable  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless you request the remand, the administrative law judge  shall notify you that your case has been remanded and tell you that if  you object, you must notify him or her of your objections within 10 days  of the date the case is remanded or we will assume   that you agree to the remand. If you object to the remand, the  administrative law judge will consider the objection and rule on it in  writing.
