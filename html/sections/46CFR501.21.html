                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority and delegation. Section 105 of Reorganization Plan No.  7 of 1961, August 12, 1961, authorizes the Commission to delegate, by  published order or rule, any of its functions to a division of the  Commission, an individual Commissioner, an administrative law judge, or  an employee or employee board, including functions with respect to  hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting or otherwise  acting as to any work, business or matter. In subpart A of this part,  the Commission has delegated general functions, and in this subpart C it  is delegating miscellaneous, specific authorities set forth in  Sec. Sec. 501.23, et seq., to the delegatees designated therein,  subject to the limitations prescribed in subsequent subsections of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deputies. Where bureau or office deputies are officially  appointed, they are hereby delegated all necessary authority to act in  the absence or incapacity of the director or chief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Redelegation. Subject to the limitations in this section, the  delegatees may redelegate their authorities to subordinate personnel  under their supervision and direction; but only if this subpart is  amended to reflect such redelegation and notice thereof is published in  the Federal Register. Under any redelegated authority, the redelegator  assumes full responsibility for actions taken by subordinate  redelegatees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exercise of authority; policy and procedure. The delegatees and  redelegatees shall exercise the authorities delegated or redelegated in  a manner consistent with applicable laws and the established policies of  the Commission, and shall consult with the General Counsel where  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exercise of delegated authority by delegator. Under any  authority delegated or redelegated, the delegator (Commission), or the  redelegator, respectively, shall retain full rights to exercise the  authority in the first instance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Review of delegatee's action. The delegator (Commission) or  redelegator   of authority shall retain a discretionary right to review an action  taken under delegated authority by a subordinate delegatee, either upon  the filing of a written petition of a party to, or an intervenor in,  such action; or upon the delegator's or redelegator's own initiative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Petitions for review of actions taken under delegated authority  shall be filed within ten (10) calendar days of the action taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the action for which review is sought is taken by a  delegatee, the petition shall be addressed to the Commission pursuant to  Sec. 502.69 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the action for which review is sought is taken by a  redelegatee, the petition shall be addressed to the redelegator whose  decision can be further reviewed by the Commission under paragraph  (f)(1)(i) of this section, unless the Commission decides to review the  matter directly, such as, for example, in the incapacity of the  redelegator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vote of a majority of the Commission less one member thereof  shall be sufficient to bring any delegated action before the Commission  for review under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Action--when final. Should the right to exercise discretionary  review be declined or should no such review be sought under paragraph  (f) of this section, then the action taken under delegated authority  shall, for all purposes, including appeal or review thereof, be deemed  to be the action of the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Conflicts. Where the procedures set forth in this section  conflict with law or any regulation of this chapter, the conflict shall  be resolved in favor of the law or other regulation.    Sec. 501.22  [Reserved]</p>
