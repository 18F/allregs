                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This exemption applies to the acquisition of rail lines with  projected annual revenues which, together with the acquiring carrier's  projected annual revenue, do not exceed the annual revenue of a Class  III railroad. To qualify for this exemption, the Class III rail carrier  applicant must file a verified notice providing details about the  transaction, and a brief caption summary, conforming to the format in  Sec.  1150.44, for publication in the Federal Register. In addition to  the written   submission, the notice and summary must be submitted on a 3.5-inch  diskette formatted for WordPerfect 5.1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exemption will be effective 30 days after the notice is  filed. The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings,  will publish a notice in the Federal Register within 16 days of the  filing. A change in operators must follow the provisions at Sec.   1150.44, and notice must be given to shippers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the notice contains false or misleading information, the  exemption is void ab initio. A petition to revoke under 49 U.S.C.  10502(d) does not automatically stay the exemption. Stay petitions must  be filed at least 7 days before the exemption becomes effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicant must preserve intact all sites and structures more  than 50 years old until compliance with the requirements of section 106  of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470f, is achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the projected annual revenue of the rail lines to be acquired  or operated, together with the acquiring carrier's projected annual  revenue, exceeds $5 million, the applicant must, at least 60 days before  the exemption becomes effective, post a notice of applicant's intent to  undertake the proposed transaction at the workplace of the employees on  the affected line(s) and serve a copy of the notice on the national  offices of the labor unions with employees on the affected line(s),  setting forth the types and numbers of jobs expected to be available,  the terms of employment and principles of employee selection, and the  lines that are to be transferred, and certify to the Board that it has  done so.
