For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a bond shall be considered executed with satisfactory surety if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is executed by a surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is secured by bonds or notes of the United States as provided in by 31 U.S.C. 9303.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other surety. Unless otherwise expressly provided in 26 U.S.C. or this part, a bond may, in the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer, be considered executed with satisfactory surety if, in lieu of being executed or secured as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Executed by a corporate surety (other than a surety company) provided such corporate surety establishes that it is within its corporate powers to act as surety for another corporation or an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Executed by two or more individual sureties, provided such individual sureties meet the conditions contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Secured by a mortgage on real or personal property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Secured by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express or telegraph money order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Secured by corporate bonds or stocks, or by bonds issued by a State or political subdivision thereof, of recognized stability; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Secured by any other acceptable collateral.
