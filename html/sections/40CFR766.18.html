                            <p class="depth0">The target level of quantitation required under Sec. 766.27 for  each HDD/HDF congener is the level which must be attempted for each  resolved HRGC peak for that congener. For at least one product sample,  at least two analyses of the same isotopically labeled HDD/HDF internal  calibration standards spiked to a final product concentration equal to  the LOQ for that congener must be reproducibly extracted, cleaned up,  and quantified to within 20 percent of each other.  For each spiked product sample, the signal to noise ratio for the  calibration standard peaks after complete extraction and cleanup must be  10:1 or greater. The recovery of the internal calibration standards in  the extracted and cleaned up product samples must be within 50 to 150  percent of the amount spiked, and the results must be corrected for  recovery.</p>
