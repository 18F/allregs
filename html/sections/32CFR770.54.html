It is vital to national defense that the operation and use of the shipyard be continued without undue or unnecessary interruptions. Additionally, most of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is dedicated to heavy industrial activity where potentially hazardous conditions exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For prevention of interruption of the stated use of the base by the presence of any unauthorized person within the boundaries of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and prevention of injury to any such unsupervised person as a consequence of the dangerous conditions which exist, as well as for other reasons, it is essential to restrict entry upon Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to authorized persons only.</p>
