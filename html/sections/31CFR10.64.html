                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Filing. The respondent's answer must be filed with the  Administrative Law Judge, and served on the Internal Revenue Service,  within the time specified in the complaint unless, on request or  application of the respondent, the time is extended by the  Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents. The answer must be written and contain a statement of  facts that constitute the respondent's grounds of defense. General  denials are not permitted. The respondent must specifically admit or  deny each allegation set forth in the complaint, except that the  respondent may state that the respondent is without sufficient  information to admit or deny a specific allegation. The respondent,  nevertheless, may not deny a material allegation in the complaint that  the respondent knows to be true, or state that the respondent is without  sufficient information to form a belief, when the respondent possesses  the required information. The respondent also must state affirmatively  any special matters of defense on which he or she relies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to deny or answer allegations in the complaint. Every  allegation in the complaint that is not denied in the answer is deemed  admitted and will be considered proved; no further evidence in respect  of such allegation need be adduced at a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Default. Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed  (or within the time for answer as extended by the Administrative Law  Judge), constitutes an admission of the allegations of the complaint and  a waiver of hearing, and the Administrative Law Judge may make the  decision by default without a hearing or further procedure. A decision  by default constitutes a decision under Sec. 10.76.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Signature. The answer must be signed by the respondent or the  respondent's authorized representative under Sec. 10.69(a)(2) and must  include a statement directly above the signature acknowledging that the  statements made in the answer are true and correct and that knowing and  willful false statements may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable  beginning August 2, 2011.  [T.D. 9011, 67 FR 48774, July 26, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9527, 76 FR  32309, June 3, 2011]</p>
