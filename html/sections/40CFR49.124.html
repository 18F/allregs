                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? This section limits the  visible emissions of air pollutants from certain air pollution sources  operating within the Indian reservation to control emissions of  particulate matter to the atmosphere and ground-level concentrations of  particulate matter, to detect the violation of other requirements in the  ``General Rules for Application to Indian Reservations in EPA Region  10'', and to indicate whether a source is continuously maintained and  properly operated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Who is affected by this section? This section applies to any  person who owns or operates an air pollution source that emits, or could  emit, particulate matter or other visible air pollutants to the  atmosphere, unless exempted in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What is exempted from this section? This section does not apply  to open burning, agricultural activities, forestry and silvicultural  activities, non-commercial smoke houses, sweat houses or lodges, smudge  pots, furnaces and boilers used exclusively to heat residential  buildings with four or fewer dwelling units, fugitive dust from public  roads owned or maintained by any Federal, Tribal, State, or local  government, and emissions from fuel combustion in mobile sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(3)</em> of this section applies to the air pollution  source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The visible emissions from an air pollution source may exceed  the 20%   opacity limit if the owner or operator of the air pollution source  demonstrates to the Regional Administrator's satisfaction that the  presence of uncombined water, such as steam, is the only reason for the  failure of an air pollution source to meet the 20% opacity limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The visible emissions from an oil-fired boiler or solid fuel- fired boiler that continuously measures opacity with a continuous  opacity monitoring system (COMS) may exceed the 20% opacity limit during  start-up, soot blowing, and grate cleaning for a single period of up to  15 consecutive minutes in any eight consecutive hours, but must not  exceed 60% opacity at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> What is the reference method for determining compliance? (1) The  reference method for determining compliance with the opacity limits is  EPA Method 9. A complete description of this method is found in appendix  A of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An alternative reference method for determining compliance is a  COMS that complies with Performance Specification 1 found in appendix B  of 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definitions of terms used in this section. The following terms  that are used in this section, are defined in Sec. 49.123 General  provisions: Act, agricultural activities, air pollutant, air pollution  source, ambient air, coal, continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS),  distillate fuel oil, emission, forestry or silvicultural activities,  fuel, fuel oil, fugitive dust, gaseous fuel, grate cleaning, marine  vessel, mobile sources, motor vehicle, nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle,  oil-fired boiler, opacity, open burning, particulate matter, PM10,  PM2.5, reference method, refuse, Regional Administrator, residual fuel  oil, smudge pot, solid fuel, solid fuel-fired boiler, soot blowing,  stack, standard conditions, start-up, stationary source, uncombined  water, used oil, visible emissions, and wood.</p>
