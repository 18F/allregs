Sec. 63.8445(i)(1) and 63.8(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must report each instance in which you did not meet each emission limit and each operating limit in this subpart that applies to you. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and routine control device maintenance. These instances are deviations from the emission limitations in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8485.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1) and your OM&M; plan. The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deviations that occur during periods of control device maintenance covered by an approved routine control device maintenance exemption according to Sec. 63.8420(e) are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with the approved routine control device maintenance exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the operating limits in Table 2 to this subpart for visible emissions (VE) from tunnel kilns equipped with DLA, DIFF, or DLS/FF by monitoring VE at each kiln stack according to the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Perform daily VE observations of each kiln stack according to the procedures of Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. You must conduct the Method 22 test while the affected source is operating under normal conditions.

If no VE are observed in 30 consecutive daily Method 22 tests for any kiln stack, you may decrease the frequency of Method 22 testing from daily to weekly for that kiln stack. If VE are observed during any weekly test, you must promptly initiate and complete corrective actions according to your OM&M; plan, resume Method 22 testing of that kiln stack on a daily basis, and maintain that schedule until no VE are observed in 30 consecutive daily tests, at which time you may again decrease the frequency of Method 22 testing to a weekly basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If VE are observed during any test conducted using Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you must report these deviations by following the requirements in Sec. 63.8485.
