                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each commuter and short-distance intercity passenger train shall  receive a Class I brake test once each calendar day that the train is  placed or continues in passenger service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, each long- distance intercity passenger train shall receive a Class I brake test:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to the train's departure from an originating terminal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Every 1,500 miles or once each additional calendar day,  whichever occurs first, that the train remains in continuous passenger  service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each passenger car and each unpowered vehicle added to a  passenger train shall receive a Class I or Class IA brake test at the  time it is added to the train unless notice is provided to the train  crew that a Class I brake test was performed on the car within the  previous calendar day and the car has not been disconnected from a  source of compressed air for more than four hours prior to being added  to the train. The notice required by this section shall contain the  date, time, and location of the last Class I brake test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each Class I brake test shall be performed by a qualified  maintenance person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each Class I brake test may be performed either separately or in  conjunction with the exterior calendar day mechanical inspection  required under Sec. 238.303.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 238.15(b), a railroad shall not use  or haul a passenger train in passenger service from a location where a  Class I brake test has been performed, or was required by this part to  have been performed, with less than 100 percent operative brakes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A Class I brake test shall be performed at the air pressure at  which the train's air brakes will be operated, but not less than 90 psi,  and shall be made to determine and ensure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The friction brakes apply and remain applied on each car in the  train until a release of the brakes has been initiated on each car in  response to train line electric, pneumatic, or other signals. This test  shall include a verification that each side of each car's brake system  responds properly to application and release signals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The brake shoes or pads are firmly seated against the wheel or  disc with the brakes applied;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Piston travel is within prescribed limits, either by direct  observation, observation of a piston travel indicator, or in the case of  tread or disc brakes by determining that the brake shoe or pad provides  pressure to the wheel. For vehicles equipped with 8\1/2\-inch or 10-inch  diameter brake cylinders, piston travel shall be within 7 to 9 inches.  If piston travel is found to be less than 7 inches or more than 9  inches, it must be adjusted to nominally 7\1/2\ inches. Proper release  of the brakes can be determined by observation of the clearance between  the brake shoe and the wheel or between the brake pad and the brake  disc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The communicating signal system is tested and known to be  operating as intended; a tested and operating two-way radio system meets  this requirement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each brake shoe or pad is securely fastened and correctly  aligned in relation to the wheel or to the disc;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The engineer's brake valve or controller will cause the proper  train line commands for each position or brake level setting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Brake pipe leakage does not exceed 5 pounds per square inch per  minute if leakage will affect service performance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The emergency brake application and deadman pedal or other  emergency control devices function as intended;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Each brake shoe or pad is not below the minimum thickness  established by the railroad. This thickness shall not be less than the  minimum thickness necessary to safely travel the maximum distance  allowed between Class I brake tests;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Each angle cock and cutout cock is properly positioned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The brake rigging or the system mounted on the car for the  transmission of the braking force operates as intended and does not bind  or foul so as to impede the force delivered to a brake shoe, impede the  release of a brake shoe, or otherwise adversely affect the operation of  the brake system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> If the train is equipped with electropneumatic brakes, an  electropneumatic application of the   brakes is made and the train is walked to determine that the brakes on  each car in the train properly apply;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Each brake disc is free of any crack in accordance with the  manufacturer's specifications or, if no specifications exist, free of  any crack to the extent that the design permits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> If the equipment is provided with a brake indicator, the brake  indicator operates as intended; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The communication of brake pipe pressure changes at the rear of  the train is verified, which may be accomplished by observation of an  application and release of the brakes on the last car in the train.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Records. A record shall be maintained of each Class I brake test  performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This record may be maintained in writing or electronically,  provided FRA has access to the record upon request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The written or electronic record must contain the following  information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date and time that the Class I brake test was performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The location where the test was performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The identification number of the controlling locomotive of the  train;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The total number of cars inspected during the test; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The signature or electronic identification of the inspector.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This record shall be maintained at the place where the  inspection is conducted or at one central location and shall be retained  for at least 92 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A long-distance, intercity passenger train that misses a  scheduled calendar day Class I brake test due to a delay en route may  proceed to the point where the Class I brake test was scheduled to be  performed. A Class I brake test shall be completed at that point prior  to placing the train back in service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In addition to complying with all the Class I brake test  requirements performed by a qualified maintenance person as contained in  paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section, railroads operating  passenger equipment that is not designed to permit the visual  observation of the brake actuation and release without the inspector  going on, under, or between the equipment in accordance with  Sec. 238.231(b) shall perform an additional inspection. At a minimum,  the additional inspection requirement for such equipment shall include  all of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> through (g)(15)  of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The additional inspection shall be conducted at an interval not  to exceed five (5) in-service days and shall be conducted while the  equipment is over an inspection pit or on a raised inspection track; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A record of the additional inspection shall be maintained  pursuant to the requirements contained in paragraph (h) of this section.  This record can be combined with the Class I brake test record.  [64 FR 25660, May 12, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 41309, July 3, 2000; 71  FR 61862, Oct. 19, 2006]</p>
