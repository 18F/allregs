(1) Products that are used in packaging, wrappings, linings, and other similar applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Products that are used in packaging, wrappings, linings, and other similar applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Films for which preferred procurement applies are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Semi-durable films. Films that are designed to resist water, ammonia, and other compounds, to be re-used, and to not readily biodegrade. Products in this item are typically used in the production of bags and packaging materials.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Non-durable films. Films that are intended for single use for short-term storage or protection before being discarded. Non-durable films that are designed to have longer lives when used are included in this item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Minimum biobased content. The minimum biobased content for all films shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Semi-durable films--45 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-durable films--85 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Preference compliance date. No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for

qualifying biobased semi-durable and non-durable films. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased semi-durable and non-durable films.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determining overlap with an EPA-designated recovered content product. Qualifying products within the semi-durable films subcategory may overlap with the EPA-designated recovered content product: Plastic trash bags. USDA is requesting that manufacturers of these qualifying biobased products provide information for the BioPreferred Web site of qualifying biobased products about the intended uses of the product, information on whether or not the product contains any recovered material, in addition to biobased ingredients, and performance standards against which the product has been tested. This information will assist Federal agencies in determining whether or not a qualifying biobased product overlaps with EPA-designated plastic trash bags and which product should be afforded the preference in purchasing.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (d): Biobased semi-durable film products within this designated item can compete with plastic trash bag products with recycled content. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, section 6002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated plastic trash bags containing recovered materials as items for which Federal agencies must give preference in their purchasing programs. The designation can be found in the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline, 40 CFR 247.16. EPA provides recovered materials content recommendations for plastic trash bags in the May 1, 1995, Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN I). The RMAN recommendations can be found on EPA's Web site http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm and then clicking on the appropriate product name.
