                            <p class="depth0">Economic incentive programs shall be State and federally  enforceable, nondiscriminatory, and consistent with the timely  attainment of NAAQS, all applicable RFP and visibility requirements,  applicable PSD increments, and all other applicable requirements of the  Act. Programs in nonattainment areas for which credit is taken in  attainment and RFP demonstrations shall be designed to ensure that the  effects of the program are quantifiable and permanent over the entire  duration of the program, and that the credit taken is limited to that  which is surplus. Statutory programs shall be designed to result in  quantifiable, significant reductions in actual emissions. The EIP's  shall include the following elements, as applicable:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statement of goals and rationale. This element shall include a  clear statement as to the environmental problem being addressed, the  intended environmental and economic goals of the program, and the  rationale relating the incentive-based strategy to the program goals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The statement of goals must include the goal that the program  will benefit both the environment and the regulated entities. The  program shall be designed so as to meaningfully meet this goal either  directly, through increased or more rapid emissions reductions beyond  those that would be achieved through a traditional regulatory program,  or, alternatively, through other approaches that will result in real  environmental benefits. Such alternative approaches include, but are not  limited to, improved administrative mechanisms, reduced administrative  burdens on regulatory agencies, improved emissions inventories, and the  adoption of emission caps which over time constrain or reduce growth- related emissions beyond traditional regulatory approaches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The incentive-based strategy shall be described in terms of one  of the following three strategies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Emission-limiting strategies, which directly specify limits on  total mass emissions, emission-related parameters (e.g., emission rates  per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions  reductions relative to a program baseline that affected sources are  required to meet, while providing flexibility to sources   to reduce the cost of meeting program requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Market-response strategies, which create one or more incentives  for affected sources to reduce emissions, without directly specifying  limits on emissions or emission-related parameters that individual  sources or even all sources in the aggregate are required to meet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Directionally-sound strategies, for which adequate procedures  to quantify emissions reductions are not defined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This element shall contain a clear definition  of the sources affected by the program. This definition shall address:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which the program is mandatory or voluntary for  the affected sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provisions, if any, by which sources that are not required to  be in the program may voluntarily enter the program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provisions, if any, by which sources covered by the program  may voluntarily leave the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any opt-in or opt-out provisions in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section shall be designed to provide mechanisms by which such program  changes are reflected in an area's attainment and RFP demonstrations,  thus ensuring that there will not be an increase in the emissions  inventory for the area caused by voluntary entry or exit from the  program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The program scope shall be defined so as not to interfere with  any other Federal requirements which apply to the affected sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Program baseline. A program baseline shall be defined as a basis  for projecting program results and, if applicable, for initializing the  incentive mechanism (e.g., for marketable permits programs). The program  baseline shall be consistent with, and adequately reflected in, the  assumptions and inputs used to develop an area's RFP plans and  attainment and maintenance demonstrations, as applicable. The State  shall provide sufficient supporting information from the areawide  emissions inventory and other sources to justify the baseline used in  the EIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For EIP's submitted in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the  submission of any areawide progress plan due at the time of EIP  submission (e.g., the 15 percent RFP plan and/or subsequent 3 percent  plans) or an attainment demonstration, a State may exercise flexibility  in setting a program baseline provided the program baseline is  consistent with and reflected in all relevant progress plans or  attainment demonstration. A flexible program baseline may be based on  the lower of actual, allowable, or some other intermediate or lower  level of emissions. For any EIP submitted prior to the submittal of an  attainment demonstration, the State shall include the following with its  EIP submittal:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A commitment that its subsequent attainment demonstration and  all future progress plans, if applicable, will be consistent with the  EIP baseline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A discussion of how the baseline will be integrated into the  subsequent attainment demonstration, taking into account the potential  that credit issued prior to the attainment demonstration may no longer  be surplus relative to the attainment demonstration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, for  EIP's submitted during a time period when any progress plans are  required but not yet submitted (e.g., the 15 percent RFP plan and/or the  subsequent 3 percent plans), the program baseline shall be based on the  lower-of-actual-or-allowable emissions. In such cases, actual emissions  shall be taken from the most appropriate inventory, such as the 1990  actual emission inventory (due for submission in November 1992), and  allowable emissions are the lower of SIP-allowable emissions or the  level of emissions consistent with source compliance with all Federal  requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For EIP's that are designed to implement new and/or previously  existing RACT requirements through emissions trading and are submitted  in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the submission of an associated  RACT rule, a State may exercise flexibility in setting a program  baseline provided the program baseline is consistent with and reflected  in the associated RACT   rule, and any applicable progress plans and attainment demonstrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For EIP's that are designed to implement new and/or previously  existing RACT requirements through emissions trading and are submitted  prior to the submission of a required RFP plan or attainment  demonstration, States also have flexibility in determining the program  baseline, provided the following conditions are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For EIP's that implement new RACT requirements for previously  unregulated source categories through emissions trading, the new RACT  requirements must reflect, to the extent practicable, increased  emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a  traditional RACT program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For EIP's that impose new RACT requirements on previously  unregulated sources in a previously regulated source category (e.g.,  RACT ``catch-up'' programs), the new incentive-based RACT rule shall, in  the aggregate, yield reductions in actual emissions at least equivalent  to that which would result from source-by-source compliance with the  existing RACT limit for that source category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A program baseline for individual sources shall, as appropriate,  be contained or incorporated by reference in federally-enforceable  operating permits or a federally-enforceable SIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An initial baseline for TCM's shall be calculated by  establishing the preexisting conditions in the areas of interest. This  may include establishing to what extent TCM's have already been  implemented, what average vehicle occupancy (AVO) levels have been  achieved during peak and off-peak periods, what types of trips occur in  the region, and what mode choices have been made in making these trips.  In addition, the extent to which travel options are currently available  within the region of interest shall be determined. These travel options  may include, but are not limited to, the degree of dispersion of transit  services, the current ridership rates, and the availability and usage of  parking facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Information used in setting a program baseline shall be of  sufficient quality to provide for at least as high a degree of  accountability as currently exists for traditional control requirements  for the categories of sources affected by the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Replicable emission quantification methods. This program  element, for programs other than those which are categorized as  directionally-sound, shall include credible, workable, and replicable  methods for projecting program results from affected sources and, where  necessary, for quantifying emissions from individual sources subject to  the EIP. Such methods, if used to determine credit taken in attainment,  RFP, and maintenance demonstrations, as applicable, shall yield results  which can be shown to have a level of certainty comparable to that for  source-specific standards and traditional methods of control strategy  development. Such methods include, as applicable, the following  elements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specification of quantification methods. This element shall  specify the approach or the combination or range of approaches that are  acceptable for each source category affected by the program. Acceptable  approaches may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Test methods for the direct measurement of emissions, either  continuously or periodically.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculation equations which are a function of process or  control system parameters, ambient conditions, activity levels, and/or  throughput or production rates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Mass balance calculations which are a function of inventory,  usage, and/or disposal records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> EPA-approved emission factors, where appropriate and adequate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any combination of these approaches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specification of averaging times.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The averaging time for any specified mass emissions caps or  emission rate limits shall be consistent with: attaining and maintaining  all applicable NAAQS, meeting RFP requirements, and ensuring equivalency  with all applicable RACT requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the averaging time for any specified VOC or NOX  mass emissions caps or emission rate limits for stationary sources (and  for other sources, as appropriate) is longer than 24 hours, the State  shall provide, in support of   the SIP submittal, a statistical showing that the specified averaging  time is consistent with attaining the O3 NAAQS and satisfying  RFP requirements, as applicable, on the basis of typical summer day  emissions; and, if applicable, a statistical showing that the longer  averaging time will produce emissions reductions that are equivalent on  a daily basis to source-specific RACT requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accounting for shutdowns and production curtailments. This  accounting shall include provisions which ensure that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Emissions reductions associated with shutdowns and production  curtailments are not double-counted in attainment or RFP demonstrations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any resultant ``shifting demand'' which increases emissions  from other sources is accounted for in such demonstrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Accounting for batch, seasonal, and cyclical operations. This  accounting shall include provisions which ensure that the approaches  used to account for such variable operations are consistent with  attainment and RFP plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Accounting for travel mode choice options, as appropriate, for  TCM's. This accounting shall consider the factors or attributes of the  different forms of travel modes (e.g., bus, ridesharing) which determine  which type of travel an individual will choose. Such factors include,  but are not limited to, time, cost, reliability, and convenience of the  mode.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Source requirements. This program element shall include all  source-specific requirements that constitute compliance with the  program. Such requirements shall be appropriate, readily ascertainable,  and State and federally enforceable, including, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emission limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For programs that impose limits on total mass emissions,  emission rates, or other emission-related parameter(s), there must be an  appropriate tracking system so that a facility's limits are readily  ascertainable at all times.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For emission-limiting EIP's that authorize RACT sources to meet  their RACT requirements through RACT/non-RACT trading, such trading  shall result in an exceptional environmental benefit. Demonstration of  an exceptional environmental benefit shall require either the use of the  statutory offset ratios for nonattainment areas as the determinant of  the amount of emissions reductions that would be required from non-RACT  sources generating credits for RACT sources or, alternatively, a trading  ratio of 1.1 to 1, at a minimum, may be authorized, provided exceptional  environmental benefits are otherwise demonstrated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An EIP (or the SIP as a whole) must contain test methods and,  where necessary, emission quantification methodologies, appropriate to  the emission limits established in the SIP. EIP sources must be subject  to clearly specified MRR requirements appropriate to the test methods  and any applicable quantification methodologies, and consistent with the  EPA's title V rules, where applicable. Such MRR requirements shall  provide sufficiently reliable and timely information to determine  compliance with emission limits and other applicable strategy-specific  requirements, and to provide for State and Federal enforceability of  such limits and requirements. Methods for MRR may include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The continuous monitoring of mass emissions, emission rates, or  process or control parameters.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In situ or portable measurement devices to verify control system  operating conditions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Periodic measurement of mass emissions or emission rates using  reference test methods.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Operation and maintenance procedures and/or other work practices  designed to prevent, identify, or remedy noncomplying conditions.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Manual or automated recordkeeping of material usage,  inventories, throughput, production, or levels of required activities.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Any combination of these methods. EIP's shall require that  responsible parties at each facility in the EIP program certify reported  information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures for determining required data, including the  emissions   contribution from affected sources, for periods for which required data  monitoring is not performed, data are otherwise missing, or data have  been demonstrated to have been inaccurately determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other applicable strategy-specific requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Projected results and audit/reconciliation procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  SIP submittal shall include projections of the emissions reductions  associated with the implementation of the program. These projected  results shall be related to and consistent with the assumptions used to  develop the area's attainment demonstration and maintenance plan, as  applicable. For programs designed to produce emissions reductions  creditable towards RFP milestones, projected emissions reductions shall  be related to the RFP baseline and consistent with the area's RFP  compliance demonstration. The State shall provide sufficient supporting  information that shows how affected sources are or will be addressed in  the emissions inventory, RFP plan, and attainment demonstration or  maintenance plan, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For emission-limiting programs, the projected results shall be  consistent with the reductions in mass emissions or emissions-related  parameters specified in the program design.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For market-response programs, the projected results shall be  based on market analyses relating levels of targeted emissions and/or  emission-related activities to program design parameters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For directionally-sound programs, the projected results may be  descriptive and shall be consistent with the area's attainment  demonstration or maintenance plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quantitative projected results shall be adjusted through the use  of two uncertainty factors, as appropriate, to reflect uncertainties  inherent in both the extent to which sources will comply with program  requirements and the overall program design.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Uncertainty resulting from incomplete compliance shall be  addressed through the use of a rule compliance factor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Programmatic uncertainty shall be addressed through the use of  a program uncertainty factor. Any presumptive norms set by the EPA shall  be used unless an adequate justification for an alternative factor is  included in supporting information to be supplied with the SIP  submittal. In the absence of any EPA-specified presumptive norms, the  State shall provide an adequate justification for the selected factors  as part of the supporting information to be supplied with the SIP  submittal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise provided in program-specific guidance issued by  the EPA, EIP's for which SIP credit is taken shall include audit  procedures to evaluate program implementation and track program results  in terms of both actual emissions reductions, and, to the extent  practicable, cost savings relative to traditional regulatory program  requirements realized during program implementation. Such audits shall  be conducted at specified time intervals, not to exceed three years. The  State shall provide timely post-audit reports to the EPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For emission-limiting EIP's, the State shall commit to ensure  the timely implementation of programmatic revisions or other measures  which the State, in response to the audit, deems necessary for the  successful operation of the program in the context of overall RFP and  attainment requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For market-response EIP's, reconciliation procedures that  identify a range of appropriate actions or revisions to program  requirements that will make up for any shortfall between credited  results (i.e., projected results, as adjusted by the two uncertainty  factors described above) and actual results obtained during program  implementation shall be submitted together with the program audit  provisions. Such measures must be federally enforceable, as appropriate,  and automatically executing to the extent necessary to make up the  shortfall within a specified period of time, consistent with relevant  RFP and attainment requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Implementation schedule. The program shall contain a schedule  for the adoption and implementation of all State commitments and source  requirements included in the program design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Administrative procedures. The program shall contain a  description of State commitments which are integral to the  implementation of the program, and the administrative system to be used  to implement the program, addressing the adequacy of the personnel,  funding, and legislative authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> States shall furnish adequate documentation of existing legal  authority and demonstrated administrative capacity to implement and  enforce the provisions of the EIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For programs which require private and/or public entities to  establish emission-related economic incentives (e.g., programs requiring  employers to exempt carpoolers/multiple occupancy vehicles from paying  for parking), States shall furnish adequate documentation of State  authority and administrative capacity to implement and enforce the  underlying program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Enforcement mechanisms. The program shall contain a compliance  instrument(s) for all program requirements, which is legally binding and  State and federally enforceable. This program element shall also include  a State enforcement program which defines violations, and specifies  auditing and inspections plans and provisions for enforcement actions.  The program shall contain effective penalties for noncompliance which  preserve the level of deterrence in traditional programs. For all such  programs, the manner of collection of penalties must be specified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emission limit violations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Programs imposing limits on mass  emissions or emission rates that provide for extended averaging times  and/or compliance on a multisource basis shall include procedures for  determining the number of violations, the number of days of violation,  and sources in violation, for statutory maximum penalty purposes, when  the limits are exceeded. The State shall demonstrate that such  procedures shall not lessen the incentive for source compliance as  compared to a program applied on a source-by-source, daily basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Programs shall require plans for remedying noncompliance at any  facility that exceeds a multisource emissions limit for a given  averaging period. These plans shall be enforceable both federally and by  the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, which provides for fines and imprisonment of up to 2  years.</p>
