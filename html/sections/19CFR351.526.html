                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Secretary may take a program-wide change into account in establishing the estimated countervailing duty cash deposit rate if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary determines that subsequent to the period of investigation or review, but before a preliminary determination in an investigation (see Sec. 351.205) or a preliminary result of an administrative review or a new shipper review (see Sec. Sec. 351.213 and 351.214), a program-wide change has occurred; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary is able to measure the change in the amount of countervailable subsidies provided under the program in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of program-wide change. For purposes of this section, ``program-wide change'' means a change that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is not limited to an individual firm or firms; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is effectuated by an official act, such as the enactment of a statute, regulation, or decree, or contained in the schedule of an existing statute, regulation, or decree.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect limited to cash deposit rate--(1) In general. The application of paragraph (a) of this section will not result in changing, in an investigation, an affirmative determination to a negative determination or a negative determination to an affirmative determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The application of paragraph (a) of this section will not result in changing, in an investigation, an affirmative determination to a negative determination or a negative determination to an affirmative determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. In a countervailing duty investigation, the Secretary determines that during the period of investigation a countervailable subsidy existed in the amount of 10 percent ad valorem. Subsequent to the period of investigation, but before the preliminary determination, the foreign government in question enacts a change to the program that reduces the amount of the subsidy to a de minimis level. In a final determination, the Secretary would issue an affirmative determination, but would establish a cash deposit rate of zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Terminated programs. The Secretary will not adjust the cash deposit rate under paragraph (a) of this section if the program-wide change consists of the termination of a program and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary determines that residual benefits may continue to be bestowed under the terminated program; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary determines that a substitute program for the terminated program has been introduced and the Secretary is not able to measure the amount of countervailable subsidies provided under the substitute program.</p>
