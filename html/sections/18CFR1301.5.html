                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general, TVA ordinarily shall respond to requests according  to their order of receipt and placement in an appropriate processing  track, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Multi-track processing procedures. TVA has established three  tracks for handling requests and the track to which a request is  assigned will depend on the nature of the request and the estimated  processing time, including a consideration of the number of pages  involved. If TVA places a request in a track other than Track 1, it will  advise requesters of the limits of its faster track(s). TVA may provide  requesters in its tracks 2 and 3 with an opportunity to limit the scope  of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the  specified limits of TVA's faster track(s). When doing so, TVA may  contact the requester either by telephone, e-mail, or letter, whichever  is most efficient in each case.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Track 1. Requests that can be answered with readily available  records or information. These are the fastest to process. These requests  ordinarily will be responded to within 20 working days of receipt of a  request by the FOIA Officer. The 20 working day time limit provided in  this paragraph may be extended by TVA for unusual circumstances, as  defined in paragraph (c) of this section, upon written notice to the  person requesting the records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Track 2. Requests where we need records or information from  other offices throughout TVA, where we must consult with other  Governmental agencies, or when we must process a submitter notice as  described in Sec. 1301.8(d), but we do not expect that the decision on  disclosure will be as time consuming as for requests in Tract 3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Tract 3. Requests which require a decision or input from another  office or agency, extensive submitter notifications because of the  presence of Business Information as defined in Sec. 1301.8(b)(1), and a  considerable amount of time will be needed for that, or the request is  complicated or involves a large number of records. Usually, these cases  will take the longest to process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unusual circumstances. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the time limits for processing  a request cannot be met because of unusual circumstances and TVA  determines to extend the time limits on that basis, TVA shall as soon as  practicable notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances  and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be  completed. Where the extension is for more than ten working days, TVA  shall provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the  request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange  an alternative time period with TVA for processing the request or a  modified request. As used in this paragraph, `unusual circumstances'  means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper  processing of the particular requests:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need to search for and collect the requested records from  field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the  office processing the request;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in  a single request; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all  practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in  the determination of the request or among two or more components of the  agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When TVA reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by  a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a  single request that would otherwise involve   unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters,  they may be aggregated, as defined in Sec. 1301.10(h). Multiple  requests by a requester involving unrelated matters will not be  aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Expedited processing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requests and appeals will be taken out  of order and given expedited treatment whenever TVA determines that they  involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which  there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which  affect public confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt  determination, a request for expedited processing must be sent to and  received by TVA's FOIA Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's  knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting  expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category in  paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the  news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main  professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though  it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester within the  category in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section also must establish a  particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity  involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about  government activity generally. The formality of certification may be  waived as a matter of administrative discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited  processing, TVA's FOIA Officer shall decide whether to grant it and  shall notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited  treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and shall be  processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing  is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted upon  expeditiously.  [64 FR 4044, Jan. 27, 1999, as amended at 75 FR 11735, Mar. 12, 2010]</p>
