                            <p class="depth0">The Principal Chief, or in his absence, the Assistant Principal  Chief shall, not more than seventy-five days nor less than sixty-five  days preceding the day appointed by law for the holding of an election  of officers of the Osage Tribe, issue in the form and manner prescribed  in Sec. 90.37, an election notice and appoint an election board  consisting of a Supervisor who shall be chairman, Assistant Supervisor,  five judges, one of whom in addition to his regular duties shall act as  interpreter, and five clerks, whose duties shall be to conduct the  election as provided in the regulations in this part:</p><p class="depth0">Provided further, That the Superintendent on the recommendation of  the election board may designate extra clerical assistants. Prior to the  date of the election, the election board shall assemble and make  necessary arrangements for the election in a building to be designated  by the Superintendent of the Osage Agency as the polling site and make  the necessary preparation for receiving prospective voters, for  receiving absentee ballots, and see to it that voting booths are  arranged to afford privacy. Members of the election board and any extra  clerical assistants designated by the Superintendent under authority  contained in this section, other than employees of the Osage Agency when  duly appointed or designated as provided for in this part may be  compensated for conducting each quadrennial election at rates to be  fixed by the Osage Tribal Council. If a member of the election board  desires to be relieved from duty for any cause, he shall notify the  Principal Chief or in his absence the Assistant Principal Chief, in  writing to that effect and the Principal Chief, or in his absence the  Assistant Principal Chief shall designate someone else to serve as a  member of the election board. The Supervisor, or in his absence the  Assistant Supervisor, shall see that the rules prescribed for conducting  the election are   faithfully carried out. The ballots shall be handed out by a judge to  the voters as they present themselves to vote, after being identified by  a clerk who shall be supplied with a copy of the list of voters prepared  pursuant to Sec. 90.35. The judge before handing out a ballot shall  remove the detachable portion. A judge shall receive the ballot after  the voter has indicated his choice thereon by placing an ``X'' mark  opposite the name of each candidate for whom he desires his vote counted  and shall deposit same in the ballot box. The duties of the remaining  judges in conjunction with the Supervisor will be to read the names on  the ballot when requested so as to identify the candidates or furnish  such other information as may be desired in that connection and also to  assist prospective voters unable because of language difficulties or  physical incapacity to cast votes for candidates of their choice, and to  undertake such other duties as may be assigned by the Supervisor.
