                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this part implement Federal statutes for the benefit of Indian tribes by establishing procedures and criteria for the Department to use to determine whether a petitioner is an Indian tribe eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians. A positive determination will result in Federal recognition status and the petitioner's addition to the Department's list of federally recognized Indian tribes. Federal recognition:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Is a prerequisite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal Government available to those that qualify as Indian tribes and possess a government-to-government relationship with the United States;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Means the tribe is entitled to the immunities and privileges available to other federally recognized Indian tribes;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Means the tribe has the responsibilities, powers, limitations, and obligations of other federally recognized Indian tribes; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subjects the Indian tribe to the same authority of Congress and the United States as other federally recognized Indian tribes.</p>
