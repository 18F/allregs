                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Arduous work. Arduous work is primarily physical work requiring  a high level of strength or endurance. The Board will consider the  claimant unable to do lighter work and therefore, disabled if he or she  has--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A marginal education (see Sec. 220.129);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Work experience of 35 years or more during which he or she did  arduous unskilled physical labor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A severe impairment which no longer allows him or her to do  arduous unskilled physical labor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. The Board may consider the claimant not disabled  if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant is working or has worked despite his or her  impairment(s) (except where work is sporadic or not medically  advisable); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence shows that the claimant has training or past work  experience which enables him or her to do substantial gainful activity  in another occupation with his or her impairment, either full-time or on  reasonably regular part-time basis.</p><p class="depth3">Example: B is a 60-year-old miner with a 4th grade education who has  a life-long history of arduous physical labor. B says that he is  disabled because of arthritis of the spine, hips, and knees, and other  impairments. Medical evidence shows a combination of impairments and  establishes that these impairments prevent B from performing his usual  work or any other type of arduous physical labor. His vocational  background does not show that he has skills or capabilities needed to do  lighter work which would be readily transferable to another work  setting. Under these circumstances, the Board will find that B is  disabled.</p>
