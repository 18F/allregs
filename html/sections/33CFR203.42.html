The Corps will conduct  an IEI to determine if the flood control work meets minimum engineering  and maintenance standards and is capable of providing the intended  degree of flood protection. An Acceptable or Minimally Acceptable rating  (see Sec. 203.48) on the IEI is required to allow the project to gain an  Active status in the RIP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CEI's are conducted periodically to ensure that projects Active  in the RIP continue to meet Corps standards, and to determine if the  sponsor's maintenance program is adequate. A rating of Acceptable or  Minimally Acceptable (see Sec. 203.48) on a CEI is required in order to  retain an Active status in the RIP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advice and reporting. Information on the results of IEI and CEI  inspections will be furnished in writing to non-Federal sponsors, and  will be maintained in Corps district offices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that an IEI rating of  Unacceptable will cause the flood control work to remain in an Inactive  status, and ineligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that a CEI rating of  Unacceptable will cause the flood control work to be placed in an  Inactive status, and ineligible for Rehabilitation Assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-Federal sponsors will be informed that maintenance  deficiencies found during CEI's may negatively impact on eligibility of  future Rehabilitation Assistance, and the degree of local cost-sharing  participation in any proposed work.
