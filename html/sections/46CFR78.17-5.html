Where such valves are accessible, they shall  be inspected at this time, otherwise, they shall be inspected at the  first opportunity when they are accessible. On vessels in which the  voyage exceeds one week in duration, these appliances shall be operated  before the vessel leaves port.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The date of the test and the condition of the equipment shall be  noted in the official logbook.</p>
