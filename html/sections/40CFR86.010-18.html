                                Sec. 86.010-18  On-board Diagnostics for engines used in
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. According to the implementation schedule shown in paragraph (o) of this section, heavy-duty engines intended for use in a heavy-duty vehicle weighing more than 14,000 pounds GVWR must be equipped with an on-board diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring all emission-related engine systems or components during the life of the engine. The OBD system is required to detect all malfunctions specified in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this Sec. 86.010-18 although the OBD system is not required to use a unique monitor to detect each of those malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the OBD system detects a malfunction, it must store a pending, a MIL-on, or a previous-MIL-on diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in the onboard computer's memory. A malfunction indicator light (MIL) must also be activated as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Data link connector. (i) For model years 2010 through 2012, the OBD system must be equipped with a data link connector to provide access to the stored DTCs as specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For model years 2010 through 2012, the OBD system must be equipped with a data link connector to provide access to the stored DTCs as specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For model years 2013 and later, the OBD system must be equipped with a standardized data link connector to provide access to the stored DTCs as specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The OBD system cannot be programmed or otherwise designed to deactivate based on age and/or mileage. This requirement does not alter existing law and enforcement practice regarding a manufacturer's liability for an engine beyond its regulatory useful life, except where an engine has been programmed or otherwise designed so that an OBD system deactivates based on age and/or mileage of the engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Drive cycle or driving cycle, in the context of this Sec. 86.010-18, means operation that meets any of the conditions of paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iv) of this section. Further, for OBD monitors that run during engine-off conditions, the period of engine-off time following engine shutoff and up to the next engine start may be considered part of the drive cycle for the conditions of paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(iv) of this section. For engines/vehicles that employ engine shutoff OBD monitoring strategies that do not require the vehicle operator to restart the engine to continue vehicle operation (e.g., a hybrid bus with engine shutoff at idle), the manufacturer may use an alternative definition for drive cycle (e.g., key-on followed by key-off). Any alternative definition must be based on equivalence to engine startup and engine shutoff signaling the beginning and ending of a single driving event for a conventional vehicle. For engines that are not likely to be routinely operated for long continuous periods of time, a manufacturer may also request approval to use an alternative definition for drive cycle (e.g., solely based on engine start and engine shutoff without regard to four hours of continuous engine-on time). Administrator approval of the alternative definition will be based on manufacturer-submitted data and/or information demonstrating the typical usage, operating habits, and/or driving patterns of these vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Begins with engine start and ends with engine shutoff;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Begins with engine start and ends after four hours of continuous engine-on operation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Begins at the end of the previous four hours of continuous engine-on operation and ends after four hours of continuous engine-on operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Begins at the end of the previous four hours of continuous engine-on operation and ends with engine shutoff.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> As an alternative to demonstrating compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (l) of this Sec. 86.010-18, a manufacturer may demonstrate how the OBD system they have designed to comply with California OBD requirements for engines used in applications greater than 14,000 pounds also complies with the intent of the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section. To make use

of this alternative, the manufacturer must demonstrate to the Administrator how the OBD system they intend to certify meets the intent behind all of the requirements of this section, where applicable (e.g., paragraph (h) of this section would not apply for a diesel fueled/CI engine). Furthermore, if making use of this alternative, the manufacturer must comply with the specific certification documentation requirements of paragraph (m)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Temporary provisions to address hardship due to unusual circumstances. (i) After considering the unusual circumstances, the Administrator may permit the manufacturer to introduce into U.S. commerce engines that do not comply with this Sec. 86.010-18 for a limited time if all the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> After considering the unusual circumstances, the Administrator may permit the manufacturer to introduce into U.S. commerce engines that do not comply with this Sec. 86.010-18 for a limited time if all the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Unusual circumstances that are clearly outside the manufacturer's control prevent compliance with the requirements of this Sec. 86.010-18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The manufacturer exercised prudent planning and was not able to avoid the violation and has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> No other allowances are available under the regulations in this chapter to avoid the impending violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To apply for an exemption, the manufacturer must send to the Administrator a written request as soon as possible before being in violation. In the request, the manufacturer must show that all the conditions and requirements of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The request must also include a plan showing how all the applicable requirements will be met as quickly as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The manufacturer shall give the Administrator other relevant information upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Administrator may include additional conditions on an approval granted under the provisions of this paragraph (a)(6), including provisions that may require field repair at the manufacturer's expense to correct the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Engines sold as non-compliant under this temporary hardship provision must display ``non-OBD'' in the data stream as required under paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section. Upon correcting the noncompliance, the data stream value must be updated accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Malfunction indicator light (MIL) and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC). The OBD system must incorporate a malfunction indicator light (MIL) or equivalent and must store specific types of diagnostic trouble codes (DTC). Unless otherwise specified, all provisions of this paragraph (b) apply for 2010 and later model years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> MIL specifications. (i) For model years 2013 and later, the MIL must be located on the primary driver's side instrument panel and be of sufficient illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting conditions. The MIL must be amber (yellow) in color; the use of red for the OBD-related MIL is prohibited. More than one general purpose malfunction indicator light for emission-related problems shall not be used; separate specific purpose warning lights (e.g., brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. When activated, the MIL shall display the International Standards Organization (ISO) engine symbol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For model years 2013 and later, the MIL must be located on the primary driver's side instrument panel and be of sufficient illumination and location to be readily visible under all lighting conditions. The MIL must be amber (yellow) in color; the use of red for the OBD-related MIL is prohibited. More than one general purpose malfunction indicator light for emission-related problems shall not be used; separate specific purpose warning lights (e.g., brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. When activated, the MIL shall display the International Standards Organization (ISO) engine symbol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The OBD system must activate the MIL when the ignition is in the key-on/engine-off position before engine cranking to indicate that the MIL is functional. The MIL shall be activated continuously during this functional check for a minimum of 5 seconds. During this MIL key-on functional check, the data stream value (see paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section) for MIL status must indicate ``commanded off'' unless the OBD system has detected a malfunction and has stored a MIL-on DTC. This MIL key-on functional check is not required during vehicle operation in the key-on/engine-off position subsequent to the initial engine cranking of an ignition cycle (e.g., due to an engine stall or other non-commanded engine shutoff).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As an option, the MIL may be used to indicate readiness status (see paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section) in a standardized format in the key-on/engine-off position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A manufacturer may also use the MIL to indicate which, if any, DTCs are currently stored (e.g., to ``blink''

the stored DTCs). Such use must not activate unintentionally during routine driver operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For model years 2013 and later, the MIL required by this paragraph (b) must not be used in any other way than is specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> MIL activation and DTC storage protocol. (i) Within 10 seconds of detecting a potential malfunction, the OBD system must store a pending DTC that identifies the potential malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within 10 seconds of detecting a potential malfunction, the OBD system must store a pending DTC that identifies the potential malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the potential malfunction is again detected before the end of the next drive cycle during which monitoring occurs (i.e., the potential malfunction has been confirmed as a malfunction), then within 10 seconds of such detection the OBD system must activate the MIL continuously and store a MIL-on DTC (systems using the SAE J1939 standard protocol specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section may either erase or retain the pending DTC in conjunction with storing the MIL-on DTC). If the potential malfunction is not detected before the end of the next drive cycle during which monitoring occurs (i.e., there is no indication of the malfunction at any time during the drive cycle), the corresponding pending DTC should be erased at the end of the drive cycle. Similarly, if a malfunction is detected for the first time and confirmed on a given drive cycle without need for further evaluation, then within 10 seconds of such detection the OBD system must activate the MIL continuously and store a MIL-on DTC (again, systems using the SAE J1939 standard protocol specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section may optionally store a pending DTC in conjunction with storing the MIL-on DTC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A manufacturer may request Administrator approval to employ alternative statistical MIL activation and DTC storage protocols to those specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Approval will depend upon the manufacturer providing data and/or engineering evaluations that demonstrate that the alternative protocols can evaluate system performance and detect malfunctions in a manner that is equally effective and timely. Strategies requiring on average more than six drive cycles for MIL activation will not be accepted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The OBD system must store a ``freeze frame'' of the operating conditions (as defined in paragraph (k)(4)(iii) of this section) present upon detecting a malfunction or a potential malfunction. In the event that a pending DTC has matured to a MIL-on DTC, the manufacturer shall either retain the currently stored freeze frame conditions or replace the stored freeze frame with freeze frame conditions regarding the MIL-on DTC. Any freeze frame stored in conjunction with any pending DTC or MIL-on DTC should be erased upon erasure of the corresponding DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the engine enters a limp-home mode of operation that can affect emissions or the performance of the OBD system, or in the event of a malfunction of an onboard computer(s) itself that can affect the performance of the OBD system, the OBD system must activate the MIL and store a MIL-on DTC within 10 seconds to inform the vehicle operator. If the limp-home mode of operation is recoverable (i.e., operation automatically returns to normal at the beginning of the following ignition cycle), the OBD system may wait to activate the MIL and store the MIL-on DTC if the limp-home mode of operation is again entered before the end of the next ignition cycle rather than activating the MIL within 10 seconds on the first drive cycle during which the limp-home mode of operation is entered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Before the end of an ignition cycle, the OBD system must store a permanent DTC(s) that corresponds to any stored MIL-on DTC(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> MIL deactivation and DTC erasure protocol--(i) Deactivating the MIL. Except as otherwise provided for in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(E) and (g)(6)(iv)(B) of this section for diesel misfire malfunctions and empty reductant tanks, and paragraphs (h)(1)(iv)(F), (h)(2)(viii), and (h)(7)(iv)(B) of this section for gasoline fuel system, misfire, and evaporative system malfunctions, once the MIL has been activated, it may be deactivated after three subsequent sequential drive cycles during which the monitoring system responsible for activating the MIL functions and the previously detected malfunction is no longer present and provided no other malfunction has

been detected that would independently activate the MIL according to the requirements outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deactivating the MIL. Except as otherwise provided for in paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(E) and (g)(6)(iv)(B) of this section for diesel misfire malfunctions and empty reductant tanks, and paragraphs (h)(1)(iv)(F), (h)(2)(viii), and (h)(7)(iv)(B) of this section for gasoline fuel system, misfire, and evaporative system malfunctions, once the MIL has been activated, it may be deactivated after three subsequent sequential drive cycles during which the monitoring system responsible for activating the MIL functions and the previously detected malfunction is no longer present and provided no other malfunction has

been detected that would independently activate the MIL according to the requirements outlined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Erasing a MIL-on DTC. The OBD system may erase a MIL-on DTC if the identified malfunction has not again been detected in at least 40 engine warm up cycles and the MIL is presently not activated for that malfunction. The OBD system may also erase a MIL-on DTC upon deactivating the MIL according to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section provided a previous-MIL-on DTC is stored upon erasure of the MIL-on DTC. The OBD system may erase a previous-MIL-on DTC if the identified malfunction has not again been detected in at least 40 engine warm up cycles and the MIL is presently not activated for that malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Erasing a permanent DTC. The OBD system can erase a permanent DTC only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The OBD system itself determines that the malfunction that caused the corresponding permanent DTC to be stored is no longer present and is not commanding activation of the MIL, concurrent with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section which, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii), shall apply to all monitors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All externally erasable DTC information stored in the onboard computer has been erased (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery disconnect) and the monitor of the malfunction that caused the permanent DTC to be stored is subject to the minimum ratio requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the OBD system shall erase the permanent DTC at the end of a drive cycle if the monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a drive cycle that the malfunction of the component or the system is not present and has not made any determinations within the same drive cycle that the malfunction is present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)(1)</em> All externally erasable DTC information stored in the onboard computer has been erased (i.e., through the use of a scan tool or battery disconnect) and the monitor of the malfunction that caused the permanent DTC to be stored is not subject to the minimum ratio requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the OBD system shall erase the permanent DTC at the end of a drive cycle provided the following two criteria have independently been satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The monitor has run and made one or more determinations during a drive cycle that the malfunction is no longer present and has not made any determinations within the same drive cycle that the malfunction is present; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The monitor does not detect a malfunction on a drive cycle and the criteria of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section has been met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> These two separate criteria may be met on the same or different drive cycles provided the monitor never detects a malfunction during either drive cycle, and if criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(i) happens first then no malfunction may be detected before criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(ii) occurs. If a malfunction occurs after criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(i) then criteria (b)(3)(iii)(C)(1)(i) must be satisfied again. For the second criterion, the manufacturer must exclude any temperature and/or elevation provisions of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. For this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C), monitors required to use ``similar conditions'' as defined in Sec. 86.010-2 to store and erase pending and MIL-on DTCs cannot require that the similar conditions be met prior to erasure of the permanent DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The Administrator shall allow monitors subject to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to use the criteria of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section in lieu of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B). Further, manufacturers may request Administrator approval to use alternative criteria to erase the permanent DTC. The Administrator shall approve alternate criteria that will not likely require driving conditions that are longer and more difficult to meet than those required under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and do not require access to enhanced scan tools to determine conditions necessary to erase the permanent DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions to MIL and DTC requirements. (i) If a limp-home mode of operation causes a overt indication (e.g.,

activation of a red engine shut-down warning light) such that the driver is certain to respond and have the problem corrected, a manufacturer may choose not to activate the MIL as required by paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. Additionally, if an auxiliary emission control device has been properly activated as approved by the Administrator, a manufacturer may choose not to activate the MIL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a limp-home mode of operation causes a overt indication (e.g.,

activation of a red engine shut-down warning light) such that the driver is certain to respond and have the problem corrected, a manufacturer may choose not to activate the MIL as required by paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. Additionally, if an auxiliary emission control device has been properly activated as approved by the Administrator, a manufacturer may choose not to activate the MIL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For gasoline engines, a manufacturer may choose to meet the MIL and DTC requirements in Sec. 86.007-17 in lieu of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Sec. 86.010-18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Monitoring conditions. The OBD system must monitor and detect the malfunctions specified in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section under the following general monitoring conditions. The more specific monitoring conditions of paragraph (d) of this section are sometimes required according to the provisions of paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As specifically provided for in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the monitoring conditions for detecting malfunctions must be technically necessary to ensure robust detection of malfunctions (e.g., avoid false passes and false indications of malfunctions); designed to ensure monitoring will occur under conditions that may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and normal vehicle use; and, designed to ensure monitoring will occur during the FTP transient test cycle contained in appendix I paragraph (f), of this part, or similar drive cycle as approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Monitoring must occur at least once per drive cycle in which the monitoring conditions are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manufacturers may define monitoring conditions that are not encountered during the FTP cycle as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In doing so, the manufacturer would be expected to consider the degree to which the requirement to run during the FTP transient cycle restricts monitoring during in-use operation, the technical necessity for defining monitoring conditions that are not encountered during the FTP cycle, whether monitoring is otherwise not feasible during the FTP cycle, and/or the ability to demonstrate that the monitoring conditions satisfy the minimum acceptable in-use monitor performance ratio requirement as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In-use performance tracking. As specifically required in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the OBD system must monitor and detect the malfunctions specified in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section according to the criteria of this paragraph (d). The OBD system is not required to track and report in-use performance for monitors other than those specifically identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but all monitors on applicable model year engines are still required to meet the in-use performance ratio as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer must implement software algorithms in the OBD system to individually track and report the in-use performance of the following monitors, if equipped, in the standardized format specified in paragraph (e) of this section: NMHC converting catalyst (paragraph (g)(5) of this section); NOX converting catalyst (paragraph (g)(6) of this section); gasoline catalyst (paragraph (h)(6) of this section); exhaust gas sensor (paragraph (g)(9) of this section) or paragraph (h)(8) of this section); evaporative system (paragraph (h)(7) of this section); EGR system (paragraph (g)(3) of this section or (h)(3) of this section); VVT system (paragraph (g)(10) of this section or (h)(9) of this section); secondary air system (paragraph (h)(5) of this section); DPF system (paragraph (g)(8) of this section); boost pressure control system (paragraph (g)(4) of this section); and, NOX adsorber system (paragraph (g)(7) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer shall not use the calculated ratio specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or any other indication of monitor frequency as a monitoring condition for a monitor (e.g., using a low ratio to enable more frequent monitoring through diagnostic executive priority or modification of other monitoring conditions, or using a high ratio to enable less frequent monitoring).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For model years 2013 and later, manufacturers must define monitoring conditions that, in addition to meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this section, ensure that the monitor yields an in-use performance ratio (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) that meets or exceeds the minimum acceptable in-use monitor performance ratio of 0.100 for all monitors specifically required in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section to meet the monitoring condition requirements of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the most reliable monitoring method developed requires a lower ratio for a specific monitor than that specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Administrator may lower the minimum acceptable in-use monitoring performance ratio.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In-use performance ratio definition. For monitors required to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the performance ratio must be calculated in accordance with the specifications of this paragraph (d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of the performance ratio is defined as the number of times a vehicle has been operated such that all monitoring conditions have been encountered that are necessary for the specific monitor to detect a malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator is defined as the number of times a vehicle has been operated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The performance ratio is defined as the numerator divided by the denominator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Specifications for incrementing the numerator. (i) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section, the numerator, when incremented, must be incremented by an integer of one. The numerator shall not be incremented more than once per drive cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section, the numerator, when incremented, must be incremented by an integer of one. The numerator shall not be incremented more than once per drive cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The numerator for a specific monitor must be incremented within 10 seconds if and only if the following criteria are satisfied on a single drive cycle:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Every monitoring condition has been satisfied that is necessary for the specific monitor to detect a malfunction and store a pending DTC, including applicable enable criteria, presence or absence of related DTCs, sufficient length of monitoring time, and diagnostic executive priority assignments (e.g., diagnostic ``A'' must execute prior to diagnostic ``B''). For the purpose of incrementing the numerator, satisfying all the monitoring conditions necessary for a monitor to determine that the monitor is not malfunctioning shall not, by itself, be sufficient to meet this criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For monitors that require multiple stages or events in a single drive cycle to detect a malfunction, every monitoring condition necessary for all events to complete must be satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For monitors that require intrusive operation of components to detect a malfunction, a manufacturer must request approval of the strategy used to determine that, had a malfunction been present, the monitor would have detected the malfunction. Administrator approval of the request will be based on the equivalence of the strategy to actual intrusive operation and the ability of the strategy to determine accurately if every monitoring condition was satisfied that was necessary for the intrusive event to occur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For the secondary air system monitor, the criteria in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through (d)(3)(ii)(C) of this section are satisfied during normal operation of the secondary air system. Monitoring during intrusive operation of the secondary air system later in the same drive cycle for the sole purpose of monitoring shall not, by itself, be sufficient to meet these criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For monitors that can generate results in a ``gray zone'' or ``non-detection zone'' (i.e., monitor results that indicate neither a properly operating system nor a malfunctioning system) or in a ``non-decision zone'' (e.g., monitors that increment and decrement counters until a pass or fail threshold is reached), the numerator, in general, shall not be incremented when the monitor indicates a result in the ``non-detection zone'' or prior to the monitor reaching a complete decision. When necessary, the Administrator will consider data and/or engineering analyses submitted by the manufacturer demonstrating the expected frequency of results in the ``non-detection zone'' and the ability of the monitor to determine accurately, had an actual malfunction

been present, whether or not the monitor would have detected a malfunction instead of a result in the ``non-detection zone.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For monitors that run or complete their evaluation with the engine off, the numerator must be incremented either within 10 seconds of the monitor completing its evaluation in the engine off state, or during the first 10 seconds of engine start on the subsequent drive cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Manufacturers that use alternative statistical MIL activation protocols as allowed in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section for any of the monitors requiring a numerator, are required to increment the numerator(s) appropriately. The manufacturer may be required to provide supporting data and/or engineering analyses demonstrating both the equivalence of their incrementing approach to the incrementing specified in this paragraph (d)(3) for monitors using the standard MIL activation protocol, and the overall equivalence of the incrementing approach in determining that the minimum acceptable in-use performance ratio of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if applicable, has been satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Specifications for incrementing the denominator.

To determine what level of misfire would cause emissions to exceed the applicable emissions thresholds, the manufacturer must determine the percentage of misfire evaluated in 1,000 revolution increments that would cause emissions from an emission durability demonstration engine to exceed the emissions thresholds if the percentage of misfire were present from the beginning of the test. To establish this percentage of misfire, the manufacturer must use misfire events occurring at equally spaced, complete engine cycle intervals, across randomly selected cylinders throughout each 1,000-revolution increment. If this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than one percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at one percent. Any misfire malfunction must be detected if the percentage of misfire established via this testing is exceeded regardless of the pattern of misfire events (e.g., random, equally spaced, continuous). The manufacturer may employ other revolution increments besides the 1,000 revolution increment. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the strategy is equally effective and timely in detecting misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine misfire monitoring conditions.

If a monitoring system cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator approve the monitoring system nonetheless. In evaluating the manufacturer's request, the Administrator will consider the following factors: the magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under required conditions (i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines).

If this percentage of misfire is exceeded, regardless of the pattern of misfire events (e.g., random, equally spaced, continuous), it shall be considered a malfunction that must be detected. To establish this percentage of misfire, the manufacturer must use misfire events occurring at equally spaced, complete engine cycle intervals, across randomly selected cylinders throughout each 1000-revolution increment. If this percentage of misfire is determined to be lower than one percent, the manufacturer may set the malfunction criteria at one percent. The manufacturer may use a longer interval than 1000 revolutions. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the strategy would be equally effective and timely at detecting misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine misfire monitoring conditions. (A) The OBD system must monitor continuously for misfire under the following conditions: from no later than the end of the second crankshaft revolution after engine start; during the rise time and settling time for engine speed to reach the desired idle engine speed at engine start-up (i.e., ``flare-up'' and ``flare-down''); and, under all positive torque engine speeds and load conditions except within the engine operating region bound by the positive torque line (i.e., engine load with the transmission in neutral), and the points represented by an engine speed of 3000 rpm with the engine load at the positive torque line and the redline engine speed with the engine's manifold vacuum at four inches of mercury lower than that at the positive torque line. For this purpose, redline engine speed is defined as either the recommended maximum engine speed as displayed on the instrument panel tachometer, or the engine speed at which fuel shutoff occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The OBD system must monitor continuously for misfire under the following conditions: from no later than the end of the second crankshaft revolution after engine start; during the rise time and settling time for engine speed to reach the desired idle engine speed at engine start-up (i.e., ``flare-up'' and ``flare-down''); and, under all positive torque engine speeds and load conditions except within the engine operating region bound by the positive torque line (i.e., engine load with the transmission in neutral), and the points represented by an engine speed of 3000 rpm with the engine load at the positive torque line and the redline engine speed with the engine's manifold vacuum at four inches of mercury lower than that at the positive torque line. For this purpose, redline engine speed is defined as either the recommended maximum engine speed as displayed on the instrument panel tachometer, or the engine speed at which fuel shutoff occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If an OBD monitor cannot detect all misfire patterns under all required engine speed and load conditions as required by paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the OBD system may still be acceptable. The Administrator will evaluate the following factors in making a determination: The magnitude of the region(s) in which misfire detection is limited; the degree to which misfire detection is limited in the region(s) (i.e., the probability of detection of misfire events); the frequency with which said region(s) are expected to be encountered in-use; the type of misfire patterns for which misfire detection is troublesome; and demonstration that the monitoring technology employed is not inherently incapable of detecting misfire under the required conditions (i.e., compliance can be achieved on other engines). The evaluation will be

based on the following misfire patterns: equally spaced misfire occurring on randomly selected cylinders; single cylinder continuous misfire; and paired cylinder (cylinders firing at the same crank angle) continuous misfire.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The manufacturer may use monitoring system that has reduced misfire detection capability during the portion of the first 1000 revolutions after engine start that a cold start emission reduction strategy is active that reduces engine torque (e.g., spark retard strategies). To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the probability of detection is greater than or equal to 75 percent during the worst case condition (i.e., lowest generated torque) for a vehicle operated continuously at idle (park/neutral idle) on a cold start between 50 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit and that the technology cannot reliably detect a higher percentage of the misfire events during the conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The manufacturer may disable misfire monitoring or use an alternative malfunction criterion when misfire cannot be distinguished from other effects. To do so, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the disablement interval or the period of use of an alternative malfunction criterion is limited only to that necessary for avoiding false detection and for one or more of the following operating conditions: Rough road; fuel cut; gear changes for manual transmission vehicles; traction control or other vehicle stability control activation such as anti-lock braking or other engine torque modifications to enhance vehicle stability; off-board control or intrusive activation of vehicle components or monitors during service or assembly plant testing; portions of intrusive evaporative system or EGR monitors that can significantly affect engine stability (i.e., while the purge valve is open during the vacuum pull-down of an evaporative system leak check but not while the purge valve is closed and the evaporative system is sealed or while an EGR monitor causes the EGR valve to be cycled intrusively on and off during positive torque conditions); or, engine speed, load, or torque transients due to throttle movements more rapid than those that occur over the FTP cycle for the worst case engine within each engine family. In general, the Administrator will not approve disablement for conditions involving normal air conditioning compressor cycling from on-to-off or off-to-on, automatic transmission gear shifts (except for shifts occurring during wide open throttle operation), transitions from idle to off-idle, normal engine speed or load changes that occur during the engine speed rise time and settling time (i.e., ``flare-up'' and ``flare-down'') immediately after engine starting without any vehicle operator-induced actions (e.g., throttle stabs), or excess acceleration (except for acceleration rates that exceed the maximum acceleration rate obtainable at wide open throttle while the vehicle is in gear due to abnormal conditions such as slipping of a clutch). The Administrator may approve misfire monitoring disablement or use of an alternate malfunction criterion for any other condition on a case by case basis upon determining that the manufacturer has demonstrated that the request is based on an unusual or unforeseen circumstance and that it is applying the best available computer and monitoring technology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> For engines with more than eight cylinders that cannot meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, a manufacturer may use alternative misfire monitoring conditions. Such use must be based on data and/or an engineering evaluation submitted by the manufacturer that demonstrate that misfire detection throughout the required operating region cannot be achieved when employing proven monitoring technology (i.e., a technology that provides for compliance with these requirements on other engines) and provided misfire is detected to the fullest extent permitted by the technology. However, the misfire detection system must still monitor during all positive torque operating conditions encountered during an FTP cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> MIL activation and DTC storage for engine misfire causing catalyst damage--(A) Pending DTCs. A pending DTC must be stored immediately if, during a single drive cycle, the specified misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is exceeded

three times when operating in the positive torque region encountered during a FTP cycle or is exceeded on a single occasion when operating at any other engine speed and load condition in the positive torque region defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. Immediately after a pending DTC is stored pursuant to this paragraph, the MIL must blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. The MIL may be deactivated during those times that misfire is not occurring. If, at the time that a catalyst damaging misfire malfunction occurs, the MIL is already activated for a malfunction other than misfire, the MIL must still blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated as appropriate in accordance with the other malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pending DTCs.

If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated as appropriate in accordance with the other malfunction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> MIL-on DTCs. If a pending DTC is stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the OBD system must immediately store a MIL-on DTC if the percentage of misfire described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is again exceeded one or more times during either the drive cycle immediately following storage of the pending DTC, regardless of the conditions encountered during that drive cycle, or on the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored. If, during a previous drive cycle, a pending DTC is stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, a MIL-on DTC must be stored immediately upon exceeding the percentage misfire described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section regardless of the conditions encountered. Upon storage of a MIL-on DTC, the MIL must blink once per second at all times during the drive cycle that engine misfire is occurring. If misfire ceases, the MIL must stop blinking but remain activated until the conditions are met for extinguishing the MIL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Erasure of pending DTCs. Pending DTCs stored in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)(iv)(A) of this section must be erased at the end of the next drive cycle in which similar conditions are encountered to those that occurred when the pending DTC was stored provided no exceedances have been detected of the misfire percentage described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. The pending DTC may also be erased if similar conditions are not encountered during the next 80 drive cycles immediately following storage of the pending DTC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exemptions for engines with fuel shutoff and default fuel control. In engines that provide for fuel shutoff and default fuel control to prevent over fueling during catalyst damaging misfire conditions, the MIL need not blink as required by paragraphs (h)(2)(iv)(A) and (h)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Instead, the MIL may be activated continuously upon misfire detection provided that the fuel shutoff and default fuel control are activated immediately upon misfire detection. Fuel shutoff and default fuel control may be deactivated only when the engine is outside of the misfire range except that the manufacturer may periodically, but not more than once every 30 seconds, deactivate fuel shutoff and default fuel control to determine if the catalyst damaging misfire is still occurring. Normal fueling and fuel control may be resumed if the catalyst damaging misfire is no longer occurring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The manufacturer may use a strategy that activates the MIL continuously rather than blinking the MIL during extreme catalyst damage misfire conditions (i.e., catalyst damage misfire occurring at all engine speeds and loads). Use of such a strategy must be limited to catalyst damage misfire levels that cannot be avoided during reasonable driving conditions. To use such a strategy, the manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that the strategy will encourage operation of the vehicle in conditions that will minimize catalyst damage (e.g., at low engine speeds and loads).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> MIL activation and DTC storage for engine misfire causing emissions to exceed applicable emissions thresholds.

For lack of circuit continuity and out-of-range malfunctions, the OBD system must, to the extent feasible, separately detect and store different DTCs for each distinct malfunction (e.g., out-of-range low, out-of-range high, open circuit). The OBD system is not required to store separate DTCs for lack of circuit continuity malfunctions that cannot be distinguished from other out-of-range circuit malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For input components that are used to activate alternative strategies that can affect emissions (e.g., AECDs,

To the extent feasible when using all available information, the rationality check must detect a malfunction if the input component inappropriately indicates a value that activates or deactivates the alternative strategy. For example, for an alternative strategy that activates when the intake air temperature is greater than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the OBD system must detect malfunctions that cause the intake air temperature sensor to indicate inappropriately a temperature above 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For engines that require precise alignment between the camshaft and the crankshaft, the OBD system must monitor the crankshaft position sensor(s) and camshaft position sensor(s) to verify proper alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft in addition to monitoring the sensors for circuit continuity and proper rationality. Proper alignment monitoring between a camshaft and a crankshaft is required only in cases where both are equipped with position sensors. For engines equipped with VVT systems and a timing belt or chain, the OBD system must detect a malfunction if the alignment between the camshaft and crankshaft is off by one or more cam/crank sprocket cogs (e.g., the timing belt/chain has slipped by one or more teeth/cogs). If a manufacturer demonstrates that a single tooth/cog misalignment cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition, the OBD system must detect a malfunction when the minimum number of teeth/cogs misalignment has occurred that does cause a measurable emission increase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Comprehensive component malfunction criteria for output components/systems. (A) The OBD system must detect a malfunction of an output component/system when proper functional response does not occur in response to computer commands. If such a functional check is not feasible, the OBD system must detect malfunctions of output components/systems caused by a lack of circuit continuity or circuit malfunction (e.g., short to ground or high voltage). For output component lack of circuit continuity malfunctions and circuit malfunctions, the OBD system is not required to store different DTCs for each distinct malfunction (e.g., open circuit, shorted low).

To do so, the manufacturer must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate that the tolerances can be exceeded without a malfunction being present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For diesel engines, the idle control system must be monitored for proper functional response to computer commands. For diesel engines, a malfunction must be detected when either of the following conditions occurs: the idle fuel control system cannot achieve the target idle speed or fuel injection quantity within [50 percent of the manufacturer-specified fuel quantity and engine speed tolerances; or, the idle fuel control system cannot achieve the target idle speed or fueling quantity within the smallest engine speed or fueling quantity tolerance range required by the OBD system to enable any other monitors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> For model years 2010 through 2012, glow plugs must be monitored for circuit continuity malfunctions. For model years 2010 and later, intake air

The glow plug/intake air heater circuit(s) must be monitored for proper current and voltage drop. The manufacturer may use other monitoring strategies but must be able to provide data and/or engineering analyses that demonstrate reliable and timely detection of malfunctions. The OBD system must also detect a malfunction when a single glow plug no longer operates within the manufacturer's specified limits for normal operation. If a manufacturer can demonstrate that a single glow plug malfunction cannot cause a measurable increase in emissions during any reasonable driving condition, the OBD system must instead detect a malfunction when the number of glow plugs needed to cause an emission increase is malfunctioning.

(1) Upon application by the manufacturer, the Administrator may accept an OBD system as compliant even though specific requirements are not fully met. Such compliances without meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will be granted only if compliance is infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors as, but not limited to: Technical feasibility of the given monitor and lead time and production cycles including phase-in or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and programmed upgrades of computers. Unmet requirements shall not be carried over from the previous model year except where

unreasonable hardware or software modifications are necessary to correct the deficiency, and the manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward compliance as determined by the Administrator.

The manufacturer must implement an OBD system meeting the applicable requirements of Sec. 86.010-18 on one engine rating within one engine family of the manufacturer's product line. This ``Full OBD'' rating will be known as the ``OBD parent'' rating. The OBD parent rating must be chosen, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, as the rating having the highest weighted projected U.S. sales within the engine family having the highest weighted projected U.S. sales, with U.S. sales being weighted by the useful life of the engine rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Full OBD. The manufacturer must implement an OBD system meeting the applicable requirements of Sec. 86.010-18 on one engine rating within one engine family of the manufacturer's product line.

The OBD parent rating must be chosen, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, as the rating having the highest weighted projected U.S. sales within the engine family having the highest weighted projected U.S. sales, with U.S. sales being weighted by the useful life of the engine rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Extrapolated OBD. For all other engine ratings within the engine family from which the OBD parent rating has been selected, the manufacturer must implement an OBD system meeting the applicable requirements of Sec. 86.010-18 except that the OBD system is not required to detect a malfunction prior to exceeding the emission thresholds shown in Table 1 of paragraph (g) and Table 2 of paragraph (h) of this section. These ``Extrapolated OBD'' engines will be know as the ``OBD child'' ratings. On these OBD child ratings, rather than detecting a malfunction prior to exceeding the emission thresholds, the manufacturer must submit a plan for Administrator review and approval that details the engineering evaluation the manufacturer will use to establish the malfunction criteria for the OBD child ratings. The plan must demonstrate both the use of good engineering judgment in establishing the malfunction criteria, and robust detection of malfunctions, including consideration of differences of base engine, calibration, emission control components, and emission control strategies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine families other than those from which the parent and child ratings have been selected, are not subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.094-14(b)(1) and (2) and as determined using 2010 model year sales, are exempt from the requirements of this Sec. 86.010-18, unless model year 2011 or model year 2012 sales exceed 20,000 units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Engines certified as alternative fueled engines are exempt from the requirements of this Sec. 86.010-18.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For model years 2013 through 2015--(i) OBD groups.

For all other engine ratings within each OBD group, the manufacturer must implement an OBD system meeting the requirements of this section except that the OBD system is not required to detect a malfunction prior to exceeding the emission thresholds shown in Table 1 of paragraph (g) and Table 2 of paragraph (h) of this section. These extrapolated OBD engines will be know as the ``OBD child'' ratings. On these OBD child ratings, rather than detecting a malfunction prior to exceeding the emission thresholds, the manufacturer must submit a plan for Administrator review and approval that details the engineering evaluation the manufacturer will use to establish the malfunction criteria for the OBD child ratings. The plan must demonstrate both the use of good engineering judgment in establishing the malfunction criteria, and robust detection of malfunctions, including consideration of differences of base engine, calibration, emission control components, and emission control strategies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Engines certified as alternative fueled engines shall meet, to the extent feasible, the requirements specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this Sec. 86.010-18. Additionally, such engines shall monitor the NOX aftertreatment system on engines so equipped and detect a malfunction if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The NOX aftertreatment system has no detectable amount of NOX aftertreatement capability (i.e., NOX catalyst conversion or NOX adsorption).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The NOX aftertreatment substrate is completely destroyed, removed, or missing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The NOX aftertreatment assembly is replaced with a straight pipe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For model years 2016 through 2018--(i) OBD groups.

This paragraph (q) applies for model year 2013 through 2015 engines when used with hybrid powertrain systems. It also applies for model year 2016 engines used with hybrid powertrain systems that were offered for sale prior to January 1, 2013, as specified in paragraph (q)(4) of this section. Manufacturers choosing to use the provisions of this paragraph (q) must submit an annual pre-compliance report to EPA for model years 2013 and later, as specified in paragraph (q)(5) of this section. Note that all hybrid powertrain systems must be fully compliant with the OBD requirements of this section no later than model year 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If an engine-hybrid system has been certified by the California Air Resources Board with respect to its OBD requirements and it effectively meets the full OBD requirements of this section, all equivalent systems must meet those same requirements and may not be certified under this paragraph (q). For purposes of this paragraph (q)(1), an engine-hybrid system is considered to be equivalent to the certified system if it uses the same basic design (e.g. displacement) for the engine and primary hybrid components (see paragraph (q)(4) of this section). Equivalent systems may have minor hardware or calibration differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As of 2013, if an engine-hybrid system has not been certified to meet the full OBD requirements of this section, it must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The engine in its installed configuration must meet the EMD and EMD+ requirements in 13 CCR Sec. 1971.1(d)(7.1.4) of the California Code of Regulations. For purposes of this paragraph (q), a given EMD requirement is deemed to be met if the engine's OBD system addresses the same function. This allowance does not apply for OBD monitors or diagnostics that have been modified under paragraph (q)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The engine-hybrid system must maintain existing OBD capability for engines where the same or equivalent engine has been OBD certified. An equivalent engine is one produced by the same engine manufacturer with the same fundamental design, but that may have hardware or calibration differences that do not impact OBD functionality, such as slightly different displacement, rated power, or fuel system. (Note that engines with the same fundamental design will be presumed to be equivalent unless the manufacturer demonstrates that the differences effectively preclude applying equivalent OBD systems.) Though the OBD capability must be maintained, it does not have to meet detection thresholds (as described in Tables 1 and 2 of this section) and in-use performance frequency requirements (as described in paragraph (d) of this section). A manufacturer may modify detection thresholds to prevent false detection, and must indicate all deviations from the originally certified package with engineering justification in the certification documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> This paragraph (q)(2)(iii) applies for derivatives of hybrid powertrain system designs that were offered for sale prior to January 1, 2013. Until these systems achieve full OBD certification, they must at a minimum maintain all fault-detection and diagnostic capability included on similar systems offered for sale prior to 2013. Manufacturers choosing to use the provisions of this paragraph (q)(2) must keep copies of the service manuals (and similar documents) for these previous model years to show the technical description of the system's fault detection and diagnostic capabilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You must submit an annual pre-compliance report to EPA for model years 2013 and later, as specified in paragraph (q)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Engine-hybrid systems may be certified to the requirements of paragraph (q)(2) of this section by the engine manufacturer, the hybrid system manufacturer, or the vehicle manufacturer. If engine manufacturers certify the engine hybrid system, they must provide detailed installation instructions. Where the engine manufacturer does not specifically certify its engines for use in hybrid vehicles under this paragraph (q), the hybrid system manufacturer and vehicle manufacturer must install the engine to conform to the requirements of this section (i.e., full OBD) or recertify under paragraph (q)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (q) apply for model year 2016 engines where you demonstrate that the hybrid powertrain system used is a derivative of a design that was offered for sale prior to January 1, 2013. In this case, you may ask us to consider the original system and the later system to be the same model for purposes of this paragraph (q), unless the systems are fundamentally different. In determining whether such systems are derivative or fundamentally different, we will consider factors such as the similarity of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transmissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hybrid machines (where ``hybrid machine'' means any system that is

the part of a hybrid vehicle system that captures energy from and returns energy to the powertrain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hybrid architecture (such as parallel or series).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Motor/generator size, controller/CPU (memory or inputs/outputs), control algorithm, and batteries. This paragraph (q)(4)(iv) applies only if all of these are modified simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Manufacturers choosing to use the provisions of this paragraph (q) must submit an annual pre-compliance report to EPA for model years 2013 and later. Engine manufacturers must submit this report with their engine certification information. Hybrid manufacturers that are not certifying the engine-hybrid system must submit their report by June 1 of the model year, or at the time of certification if they choose to certify. Include the following in the report:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the manufacturer's product plans and of the engine-hybrid systems being certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of activities undertaken and progress made by the manufacturer towards achieving full OBD certification, including monitoring, diagnostics, and standardization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For model year 2016 engines, a description of your basis for applying the provision of this paragraph (q) to the engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Manufacturers that modify the engine's diagnostic system from the approved configuration to be compatible with a hybrid powertrain system under this paragraph (q) must add the following compliance statement to the ECI label: ``for use in hybrid applications only''.
