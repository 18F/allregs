At least 25 percent of such route disposition and transfers must be to outlets in the marketing area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any distributing plant located in the marketing area which during the month processed at least 25 percent of the total quantity of fluid milk products physically received at the plant (excluding concentrated milk received from another plant by agreement for other than Class I use) into ultra-pasteurized or aseptically-processed fluid milk products.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A supply plant from which 50 percent or more of the total quantity of milk that is physically received at such plant from dairy farmers and handlers described in Sec. 1000.9(c), including milk that is diverted as producer milk to other plants, is transferred to pool distributing plants. Concentrated milk transferred from the supply plant to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other than Class I shall be excluded from the supply plant's shipments in computing the plant's shipping percentage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A plant located within the marketing area and operated by a cooperative association if, during the month, or the immediately preceding 12-month period ending with the current month, 35 percent or more of the producer milk of members of the association (and any producer milk of nonmembers and members of another cooperative association which may be marketed by the cooperative association) is physically received in the form of bulk fluid milk products (excluding concentrated milk transferred to a distributing plant for an agreed-upon use other that Class I) at plants specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (h) of this section either directly from farms or by transfer from supply plants operated by the cooperative association and from plants of the cooperative association for which pool plant status has been requested under this paragraph subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plant does not qualify as a pool plant under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (h) of this section or under comparable provisions of another Federal order; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plant is approved by a duly constituted regulatory agency for the handling of milk approved for fluid consumption in the marketing area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Two or more plants operated by the same handler and located in the marketing area may qualify for pool plant status as a unit by together meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section and subject to all of the following additional requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least one of the plants in the unit must qualify as a pool plant pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other plants in the unit must process Class I or Class II products, using 50 percent or more of the total Grade A fluid milk products received in bulk form at such plant or diverted therefrom by the plant operator in Class I or Class II products, and must be located in a pricing zone providing the same or lower Class I price than the price applicable at the distributing plant included in the unit pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written request to form a unit must be filed by the handler with the market administrator prior to the first day of the month for which such status is desired to be effective.

Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for adjustment either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested parties if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that an adjustment of the shipping percentages might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that an adjustment is being considered and invite data, views and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable shipping percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The term pool plant shall not apply to the following plants:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A producer-handler as defined under any Federal order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An exempt plant as defined in Sec. 1000.8(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A plant located within the marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section which meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order, and from which more than 50 percent of its route disposition has been in the other Federal order marketing area for 3 consecutive months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A plant located outside any Federal order marketing area and qualified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section that meets the pooling requirements of another Federal order and has had greater route disposition in such other Federal order's marketing area for 3 consecutive months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A plant located in another Federal order marketing area and qualified
