A merger involves the combination of one or more associations into a continuing constituent association, which retains its charter and bylaws (except as amended to effect the merger proposal). A consolidation involves the combination of two or more associations into a newly organized association having a new charter and bylaws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where two or more associations plan to merge or consolidate, or where the district board has adopted a reorganization plan for the associations in the district, the associations involved shall jointly submit a request to the district bank containing the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a merger, a copy of the charter of the continuing association reflecting any proposed amendments.
