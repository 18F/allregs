Stationary RICE differ from mobile RICE in that a  stationary RICE is not a non-road engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30,  and is not used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for  competition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or  has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07  megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25  tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas  production facilities, a major source of HAP emissions is determined for  each surface site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An area source of HAP emissions is a source that is not a major  source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you are an owner or operator of an area source subject to  this subpart, your status as an entity subject to a standard or other  requirements under this subpart does not subject you to the obligation  to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, provided you are not  required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a) for a  reason other than your status as an area source under this subpart.  Notwithstanding the previous sentence,   you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart as  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you are an owner or operator of a stationary RICE used for  national security purposes, you may be eligible to request an exemption  from the requirements of this subpart as described in 40 CFR part 1068,  subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing residential emergency stationary RICE located at an  area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not  contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per  calendar year for the purposes specified in Sec. 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and  (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in Sec.  63.6640(f)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> and (iii) and that do  not operate for the purpose specified in Sec. 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Existing institutional emergency stationary RICE located at an  area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not  contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per  calendar year for the purposes specified in Sec. 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and  (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in Sec.  63.6640(f)(4)(ii).
