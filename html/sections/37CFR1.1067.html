Where a nonprovisional international design application does not contain a title of the design, the Office may establish a title. No description, other than a reference to the drawing, is ordinarily required in a nonprovisional international design application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An international design application designating the United States must include the inventor's oath or declaration. See Sec.  1.1021(d). If the applicant is notified in a notice of allowability that an oath or declaration in compliance with Sec.  1.63, or substitute statement in compliance with Sec.  1.64, executed by or with respect to each named inventor has not been filed, the applicant must file each required oath or declaration in compliance with Sec.  1.63, or substitute statement in compliance with Sec.  1.64, no later than the date on which the issue fee is paid to avoid abandonment. This time period is not extendable under Sec.  1.136 (see Sec.  1.136(c)).</p>
