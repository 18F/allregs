The Act of June 23, 1938 (52 Stat. 1033; 43 U.S.C. 315m-1, 315m-4 inclusive), known as the Pierce Act, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior in his discretion to lease, at rates to be determined by him, any State, county, or privately owned lands chiefly valuable for grazing purposes and lying within the exterior boundaries of grazing districts created under the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269, as amended; 43 U.S.C. 315 et seq.) when in his judgment, the leasing of such lands will promote the orderly use of the district and aid in conserving the forage resources of the public lands therein, and the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management may approve leases under the Pierce Act on behalf of the United States in accordance with this part. Leases so approved need not be submitted for Secretarial approval.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 4610_Procedures</p>
