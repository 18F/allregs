                            <p class="depth0">Restricted dates may be disposed of only through exportation to such countries as the Committee may approve or by diversion in product outlets described in Sec. 987.43 which the Committee concludes to be appropriate and which will result in dates moving into consumption in a form other than that of whole or pitted dates. To facilitate sales and promote orderly marketing of any variety of restricted dates handled in export, the Committee may participate in or negotiate for handlers, the sale of such dates to meet all or a substantial part of the needs of the particular country, and, in connection with each such sale, the Committee shall extend to all handlers an opportunity to participate therein and shall distribute the returns therefrom to participating handlers according to their respective contributions of dates. The Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may prescribe rules and regulations governing the opportunity to participate in such sales. The provisions of this section shall not preclude restricted dates being disposed of in outlets for utility and cull dates prescribed in Sec. 987.56.
