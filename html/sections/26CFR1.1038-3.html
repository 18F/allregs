                                Sec. 1.1038-3  Election to have section 1038 apply for taxable years
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. If an election is made in the manner provided by  paragraph (b) of this section, the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec.  1.1038-1 and 1.1038-2 shall apply to all reacquisitions of real property  occurring in each and every taxable year beginning after December 31,  1957, and before September 3, 1964, for which the assessment of a  deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment, is not prevented  on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law. The  election so made shall apply to all taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, for which the  assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an overpayment,  is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or  rule of law and   shall apply to every reacquisition occurring in such taxable years. The  fact that the assessment of a deficiency, or the credit or refund of an  overpayment, is prevented for any other taxable year or years affected  by the election will not prohibit the making of an election under this  section. For example, if an individual who uses the calendar year as the  taxable year were to sell in 1960 real property used as his principal  residence in respect of the sale of which gain is not recognized under  section 1034, and if such property were reacquired by the seller in 1962  and resold within 1 year, he would be permitted to make an election  under this section with respect to such reacquisition even though on  September 2, 1964, the period of limitations on assessment or refund has  run for 1960. An election under this section shall be deemed a consent  to the application of the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner of making election--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An  election to have the provisions of Sec. 1.1038-2 apply to  reacquisitions of real property occurring in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, shall be made by  filing on or before September 3, 1965, a return, an amended return, or a  claim for refund, whichever is proper, for each taxable year in which  the resale of such real property occurs. If the return for any such year  is not due on or before such date and has not been filed, the election  with respect to such taxable year shall be made by filing on or before  such date the statement described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An election to have the provisions of Sec. 1.1038-1 apply to  reacquisitions of real property occurring in taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1957, and before September 3, 1964, shall be made by  filing on or before September 3, 1965, a return, an amended return, or a  claim for refund, whichever is proper, for each taxable year in which  such reacquisitions occur. If the return for any such year is not due on  or before such date and has not been filed, the election with respect to  such taxable year shall be made by filing on or before such date the  statement described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the facts are such that Sec. 1.1038-2 applies to a  reacquisition of property except that the reacquisition occurs in a  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, and before September 3,  1964, an election may not be made under this paragraph to have the  provisions of Sec. 1.1038-1 apply to such reacquisition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Once made, an election under this paragraph may not be revoked  after September 3, 1965. To any return, amended return, or claim for  refund filed under this subparagraph there shall be attached the  statement described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Statement to be attached. The statement described in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall indicate--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name, address and account number of the taxpayer, and the  fact that the taxpayer is electing to have the provisions of section  1038 apply to the reacquisitions of real property,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxable years in which the reacquisitions of property occur  and any other taxable year or years the tax for which is affected by the  application of section 1038 to such reacquisitions,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The office of the district director where the return or  returns for such taxable year or years were or will be filed,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The dates on which such return or returns were filed and on  which the tax for such taxable year or years was paid,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The type of real property reacquired, the terms under which such  property was sold and reacquired, and an indication of whether the  taxpayer is applying the provisions of Sec. 1.1038-2 to the  reacquisition of such property,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If Sec. 1.1038-2 is being applied to the reacquisition, the  terms under which the old residence was resold and, if applicable, the  terms under which the new residence was sold, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The office where, and the date when, the election to apply  section 121 in respect to any sale of such property was or will be made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Place for filing. Any claim for refund, amended return, or  statement, filed under this paragraph in respect of any taxable year,  whether the taxable   year in which occurs the reacquisition of property or the taxable year  in which occurs the resale of the old residence, shall be filed in the  office of the district director in which the return for such taxable  year was or will be filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Extension of period of limitations on assessment or refund--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Assessment of tax. If an election is properly made under paragraph (b)  of this section and the assessment of a deficiency for the taxable years  to which such election applies is not prevented on September 2, 1964, by  the operation of any law or rule of law, the period within which a  deficiency for such taxable years may be assessed shall, to the extent  such deficiency is attributable to the application of section 1038, not  expire prior to one year after the date on which such election is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refund of tax. If an election is properly made under paragraph  (b) of this section and the credit or refund of any overpayment for the  taxable years to which such election applies is not prevented on  September 2, 1964, by the operation of any law or rule of law, the  period within which a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment for  such taxable years may be filed shall, to the extent such overpayment is  attributable to the application of section 1038, not expire prior to one  year after the date on which such election is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of interest for period prior to September 2, 1964. No  interest shall be payable with respect to any deficiency attributable to  the application of the provisions of section 1038, and no interest shall  be allowed with respect to any credit or refund of any overpayment  attributable to the application of such section, for any period prior to  September 2, 1964. See section 2(c)(3) of the Act of September 2, 1964  (Pub. L. 88-750, 78 Stat. 856).  [T.D. 6916, 32 FR 5930, Apr. 13, 1967]</p>
