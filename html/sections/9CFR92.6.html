APHIS will base its determination of the date of  effective enforcement on the information included in the dossier the  region submitted when it requested to be classified regarding BSE risk.  The information APHIS will consider will include, but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Policies and infrastructure for feed ban enforcement, including  an awareness program for producers and farmers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Livestock husbandry practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disposition of processed animal protein produced from domestic  bovines, including the feeding of such material to any animal species;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Measures taken to control cross-contamination and mislabeling of  feed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitoring and enforcement of the ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban,  including audit findings in rendering plants and feed mills that process  ruminant material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> After conducting its evaluation, APHIS will announce in the  Federal Register for public comment the date APHIS considers to be the  date of effective enforcement of a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban in the  requesting region, and will make available to the public the evaluation  conducted by APHIS, as well as the supporting documentation. Following  review of any comments received, the Administrator will announce his or  her final determination in the Federal Register, along with a discussion  of and response to pertinent issues raised by commenters.</p>
