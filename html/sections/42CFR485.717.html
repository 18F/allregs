The agency's therapy services are furnished by qualified individuals as direct services and/or services provided under contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standard: Arrangements for services. If services are provided under contract, the contract must specify the term of the contract, the manner of termination or renewal and provide that the agency retains responsibility for the control and supervision of the services.
