                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federal excise taxes are levied on the sale or use of particular  supplies or services. Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,  Miscellaneous Excise Taxes, 26 U.S.C. 4041 et seq., and its implementing  regulations, 26 CFR parts 40 through 299, cover miscellaneous federal  excise tax requirements. Questions arising in this area should be  directed to the agency-designated counsel. The most common excise taxes  are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers' excise taxes imposed on certain motor-vehicle  articles, tires and inner tubes, gasoline, lubricating oils, coal,  fishing equipment, firearms, shells, and cartridges sold by  manufacturers, producers, or importers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special-fuels excise taxes imposed at the retail level on diesel  fuel and special motor fuels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sometimes the law exempts the Federal Government from these  taxes. Contracting officers should solicit prices on a tax-exclusive  basis when it is known that the Government is exempt from these taxes,  and on a tax-inclusive basis when no exemption exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Executive agencies shall take maximum advantage of available  Federal excise tax exemptions.  [48 FR 42293, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 55 FR 52793, Dec. 21, 1990]</p>
