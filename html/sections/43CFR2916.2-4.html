No lease will be canceled until the  lessee has been formally notified of such default and such default shall  continue for 60 days after service of such notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Removal of improvements and personal property. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Improvements  or personal property may not be removed from the lands, except fur- bearing animals disposed of in the regular course of business, unless  all moneys due the United States under the lease have been paid. The  lessee shall be allowed 90 days from the date of expiration or  termination of the lease within which to remove his personal property  and such improvements as are not disposed of in the manner set forth in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which he has a right to remove; if not  removed or otherwise disposed of within the said period, such  improvements or personal property shall become the property of the  United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon the expiration of the lease or the earlier termination  thereof, the authorizing officer may, in his discretion and upon a  written petition filed by the lessee within 30 days from the date of  such expiration or termination, require the subsequent lease applicant,  prior to the execution of a new lease, to agree to compensate the lessee  for any improvements of a permanent nature that he may have placed upon  the leased area for fur-farming purposes during the period of the lease.  If the interested parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the  amount of compensation, the amount shall be fixed by the authorizing  officer. All such agreements to be effective, must be approved by the  authorizing officer. The failure of the subsequent lessee to pay the  former lessee in accordance with such agreement will be just cause for  cancellation of the lease.</p>
