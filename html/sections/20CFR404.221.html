                                Sec. 404.221  Computing your average monthly wage.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Under the average-monthly-wage method, your social  security earnings are averaged over the length of time you can  reasonably have been expected to have worked under social security after  1950 (or after you reached age 21, if later).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Which of your earnings may be used in computing your average  monthly wage. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In computing your average monthly wage, we consider  all the wages, compensation, self-employment income, and deemed military  wage credits that are creditable to you for social security purposes.  (The maximum amounts creditable are explained in Secs. 404.1047 and  404.1096 of this part.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We use your earnings in your computation base years in computing  your average monthly wage. All years after 1950 up to (but not  including) the year you become entitled to old-age or disability  insurance benefits, or through the year you die if you had not been  entitled to old-age or disability benefits, are computation base years  for you. Years after the year you die may not be used as computation  base years even if you have earnings credited to you in them. However,  years beginning with the year you become entitled to   benefits may be used for benefits beginning with the following year if  using them would give you a higher primary insurance amount. Years  wholly within a period of disability are not computation base years  unless your primary insurance amount would be higher if they were. In  such situations, we count all the years during the period of disability,  even if you had no earnings in some of them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Number of years to be considered in computing your average  monthly wage. To find the number of years to be used in computing your  average monthly wage--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> We count the years beginning with 1951 or (if later) the year  you reached age 22 and ending with the year before you reached age 62,  or became disabled, or died before age 62. Any part of a year--or  years--in which you were disabled, as defined in Sec. 404.1505, is not  counted unless doing so would give you a higher average monthly wage. In  that case, we count all the years during the period of disability, even  if you had no earnings in some of those years. These are your elapsed  years. (If you are a male and you reached age 62 before 1975, see  paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the rules on finding your elapsed  years.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a male and you reached age 62 in--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 1972 or earlier, we count the years beginning with 1951 and  ending with the year before you reached age 65, or became disabled or  died before age 65 to find your elapsed years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 1973, we count the years beginning with 1951 and ending with  the year before you reached age 64, or became disabled or died before  age 64 to find your elapsed years; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 1974, we count the years beginning with 1951 and ending with  the year before you reached age 63, became disabled, or died before age  63 to find your elapsed years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Then we subtract 5 from the number of your elapsed years. This  is the number of your benefit computation years; we use the same number  of your computation base years in computing your average monthly wage.  For benefit computation years, we use the years with the highest amounts  of earnings, but they may include years of no earnings. You cannot have  fewer than 2 benefit computation years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Your average monthly wage. After we find your benefit  computation years, we compute your average monthly wage by--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Totalling your creditable earnings in your benefit computation  years;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dividing the total by the number of months in your benefit  computation years; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rounding the quotient to the next lower whole dollar if not  already a multiple of $1.</p><p class="depth3">Example: Mr. B reaches age 62 and becomes entitled to old-age  insurance benefits in August 1978. He had no social security earnings  before 1951 and his year-by-year social security earnings after 1950 are  as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Year                               Earnings ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1951.......................................................       $2,700 1952.......................................................        2,700 1953.......................................................        3,400 1954.......................................................        3,100 1955.......................................................        4,000 1956.......................................................        4,100 1957.......................................................        4,000 1958.......................................................        4,200 1959.......................................................        4,800 1960.......................................................        4,800 1961.......................................................        4,800 1962.......................................................        4,800 1963.......................................................        4,800 1964.......................................................        1,500 1965.......................................................            0 1966.......................................................            0 1967.......................................................            0 1968.......................................................        3,100 1969.......................................................        5,200 1970.......................................................        7,100 1971.......................................................        7,800 1972.......................................................        8,600 1973.......................................................        8,900 1974.......................................................        9,700 1975.......................................................       10,100 1976.......................................................       10,800 1977.......................................................       11,900 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">We first find Mr. B's elapsed years, which are the 27 years 1951- 1977. We subtract 5 from his 27 elapsed years to find that we must use  22 benefit computation years in computing his average monthly wage. His  computation base years are 1951-1977, which are the years after 1950 and  prior to the year he became entitled. This means that we will use his 22  computation base years with the highest earnings to compute his average  monthly wage. Thus, we exclude the years 1964-1967 and 1951.</p><p class="depth3">We total his earnings in his benefit computation years and get  $132,700. We then divide that amount by the 264 months in his 22 benefit  computation years and find his average monthly wage to be $502.65, which  is rounded down to $502.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ``Deemed'' average monthly wage for certain deceased veterans of  World War II. Certain deceased veterans of World War II are ``deemed''  to have an average monthly wage of $160 (see Secs. 404.1340 through  404.1343 of this part) unless their actual average monthly wage, as  found in the method described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this  section is higher.</p>
