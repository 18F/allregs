                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> New engines/equipment you produce that are used solely for competition are generally excluded from emission standards. See the standard-setting parts for specific provisions where applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you modify any nonroad engines/equipment after they have been placed into service in the United States so they will be used solely for competition, they are exempt without request. This exemption applies only to the prohibition in Sec.  1068.101(b)(1) and is valid only as long as the engine/equipment is used solely for competition. You may not use the provisions of this paragraph (b) to circumvent the requirements that apply to the sale of new competition engines under the standard-setting part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you modify any nonroad engines/equipment under paragraph (b) of this section, you must destroy the original emission labels. If you loan, lease, sell, or give any of these engines/equipment to someone else, you must tell the new owner (or operator, if applicable) in writing that they may be used only for competition.
