All other employees included in the original minimum wage and  overtime exemption remained within it (63 Stat. 910).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> By the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, both these  exemptions were further revised to read as set forth in Sec. Sec.  784.100 and 784.101. The effect of this change was to provide a means of  equalizing the application of the Act as between canning employees and  employees employed in other processing, marketing, and distributing of  aquatic products on shore, to whom minimum wage protection, formerly  provided only for canning employees, was extended by this action. The  1961 amendments, however, left employees employed in fishing, in fish  farming, and in related occupations concerned with procurement of  aquatic products from nature, under the existing exemption from minimum  wages as well as overtime pay.</p>
