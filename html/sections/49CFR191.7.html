                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this  section, an operator must submit each report required by this part  electronically to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration at http://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline unless an  alternative reporting method is authorized in accordance with paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions: An operator is not required to submit a safety- related condition report (Sec. 191.25) electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safety-related conditions. An operator must submit concurrently  to the applicable State agency a safety-related condition report  required by Sec. 191.23 for intrastate pipeline transportation or when  the State agency acts as an agent of the Secretary with respect to  interstate transmission facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative Reporting Method. If electronic reporting imposes an  undue burden and hardship, an operator may submit a written request for  an alternative reporting method to the Information Resources Manager,  Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration, PHP-20, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington DC 20590.  The request must describe the undue burden and hardship. PHMSA will  review the request and may authorize, in writing, an alternative  reporting method. An authorization will state the period for which it is  valid, which may be indefinite. An operator must contact PHMSA at 202- 366-8075, or electronically to informationresourcesmanager@dot.gov or  make arrangements for submitting a report that is due after a request  for alternative reporting is submitted but before an authorization or  denial is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). An operator must  provide the NPMS data to the address identified in the NPMS Operator  Standards manual available at www.npms.phmsa.dot.gov or by contacting  the PHMSA Geographic Information Systems Manager at (202) 366-4595.
