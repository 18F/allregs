                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon request or application by any person intending to export any poultry product, any inspector is authorized to issue an official export certificate as prescribed in Sec. 381.107 with respect to the shipment to any foreign country of any inspected and passed poultry product, after adequate inspection of the product has been made by the inspector to determine its identity as inspected and passed and eligible for export: Provided, that the product is offered for inspection at an official establishment. Each shipping container covered by the export certificate, except ship stores, small quantities exclusively for the personal use of the consignee and not for sale or distribution, and shipments by and for the U.S. Armed Forces, shall be marked with an official export stamp as shown in Sec. 381.104 bearing the number of the export certificate. Official export certificates will be issued only upon condition that the products covered thereby shall be subject to reinspection at any place and at any time prior to exportation to determine the identity of the products and their eligibility for certification, and such certificates shall

become invalid if such reinspection is refused or discloses that the products are not eligible for certification. If reinspection discloses that any poultry products covered by an export certificate are not eligible for such certification, a superseding certificate setting forth such findings shall be issued and copies shall be furnished to interested persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The original and a duplicate of each official export certificate shall be delivered to the person who requested such certificate or his agent. Such person may duplicate such numbers of exact copies of the original as he requires in connection with the exportation of the poultry products. Additional official file copies of the export certificates shall be prepared and distributed by the inspector in accordance with the instructions of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Only one certificate shall be issued for each consignment, except in case of error in the certificate or loss of the certificate originally issued. A request for a new certificate, except in the case of a lost certificate, shall be accompanied by the original and all copies of the first certificate. The new certificate shall carry the following statement: ``This certificate supersedes certificate No. ___ Dated _____. The outside container of the poultry product covered by this certificate is stamped with United States Department of Agriculture Certificate No. ___.''
