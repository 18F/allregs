                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of section 269, an acquisition of  control occurs when one or more persons acquire beneficial ownership of  stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power  of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the  total value of share of all classes of stock of the corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of general rule to certain creditor acquisitions.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of section 269, creditors of an insolvent or bankrupt  corporation (by themselves or in conjunction with other persons) acquire  control of the corporation when they acquire beneficial ownership of the  requisite amount of stock. Although insolvency or bankruptcy may cause  the interests of creditors to predominate as a practical matter,  creditor interests do not constitute beneficial ownership of the   corporation's stock. Solely for purposes of section 269, creditors of a  bankrupt corporation are treated as acquiring beneficial ownership of  stock of the corporation no earlier than the time a bankruptcy court  confirms a plan of reorganization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following  example.</p><p class="depth3">Example. Corporation L files a petition under chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy Code on January 5, 1987. A creditors' committee is formed. On  February 22, 1987, and upon the request of the creditors, the bankruptcy  court removes the debtor-in-possession from business management and  operations and appoints a trustee. The trustee consults regularly with  the creditors' committee in formulating both short-term and long-term  management decisions. After three years, the creditors approve a plan of  reorganization in which the outstanding stock of Corporation L is  canceled and its creditors receive shares of stock constituting all of  the outstanding shares. The bankruptcy court confirms the plan of  reorganization on March 23, 1990, and the plan is put into effect on May  25, 1990. For purposes of section 269, the creditors acquired control of  Corporation L than March 23, 1990. Similarly, the determination of  whether the creditors acquired control of Corporation L no earlier with  the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax is  made by reference to the creditors' purposes as of no earlier than March  23, 1990.
