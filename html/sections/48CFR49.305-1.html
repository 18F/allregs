                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The TCO shall determine the adjusted fee to be paid, if any, in  the manner provided by the contract. The determination is generally  based on a percentage of completion of the contract or of the terminated  portion. When this basis is used, factors such as the extent and  difficulty of the work performed by the contractor (e.g., planning,  scheduling, technical study, engineering work production and  supervision, placing and supervising subcontracts, and work performed by  the contractor in (1) stopping performance, (2) settling terminated  subcontracts, and (3) disposing of termination inventory) shall be  compared with the total work required by the contract or by   the terminated portion. The contractor's adjusted fee shall not include  an allowance for fee for subcontract effort included in subcontractors'  settlement proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated cost of  performing the contract or the terminated portion is only one factor in  computing the percentage of completion. This percentage may be either  greater or less than that indicated by the ratio of costs incurred,  depending upon the evaluation by the TCO of other pertinent factors.</p>
