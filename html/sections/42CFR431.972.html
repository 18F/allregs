(1) The PERM claims universe includes payments that were originally paid (paid claims) and for which payment was requested but denied (denied claims) during the FFY, and for which there is FFP (or would have been if the claim had not been denied) through Title XIX (Medicaid) or Title XXI (CHIP).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State must establish controls to ensure FFS and managed care universes are accurate and complete, including comparing the FFS and managed care universes to the Form CMS-64 and Form CMS-21 as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sample size. CMS estimates a State's annual sample size for claims review at the beginning of the PERM cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Precision and confidence levels. The annual sample size should be estimated to achieve a State-level error rate within a 3 percent precision level at 95 percent confidence interval for the claims component of the PERM program, unless the precision requirement is waived by CMS on its own initiative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Base year sample size.
