                            <p class="depth0">If performance under the clause at 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans, may necessitate a revision of a collective bargaining agreement, the contracting officer must advise the affected labor unions that the Department of Labor will give them appropriate opportunity to present their views. However, neither the contracting officer nor any representative of the contracting officer may discuss with the contractor or any labor representative any aspect of the collective bargaining agreement.
