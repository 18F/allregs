                            <p class="depth0">When conducting the activities identified in Sec.  219.11(a) of this chapter, the mitigation measures contained in any LOA issued under Sec. Sec.  216.106 and 219.17 of this chapter must be implemented. These mitigation measures shall include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SWFSC shall take all necessary measures to coordinate and communicate in advance of each specific survey with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) or other relevant parties on non-NOAA platforms to ensure that all mitigation measures and monitoring requirements described herein, as well as the specific manner of implementation and relevant event-contingent decision-making processes, are clearly understood and agreed upon.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SWFSC shall coordinate and conduct briefings at the outset of each survey and as necessary between ship's crew (Commanding Officer/master or designee(s), as appropriate) and scientific party in order to explain responsibilities, communication procedures, marine mammal monitoring protocol, and operational procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SWFSC shall coordinate as necessary on a daily basis during survey cruises with OMAO personnel or other

relevant personnel on non-NOAA platforms to ensure that requirements, procedures, and decision-making processes are understood and properly implemented.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When deploying any type of sampling gear at sea, SWFSC shall at all times monitor for any unusual circumstances that may arise at a sampling site and use best professional judgment to avoid any potential risks to marine mammals during use of all research equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> SWFSC shall implement handling and/or disentanglement protocols as specified in guidance provided to SWFSC survey personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pelagic longline survey protocols:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SWFSC shall deploy longline gear as soon as is practicable upon arrival at the sampling station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SWFSC shall initiate marine mammal watches (visual observation) no less than thirty minutes prior to both deployment and retrieval of the longline gear. Marine mammal watches shall be conducted by scanning the surrounding waters with the naked eye and rangefinding binoculars (or monocular). During nighttime operations, visual observation shall be conducted using the naked eye and available vessel lighting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SWFSC shall implement the move-on rule. If one or more marine mammals are observed within 1 nm of the planned location in the thirty minutes before gear deployment, SWFSC shall transit to a different section of the sampling area to maintain a minimum set distance of 1 nm from the observed marine mammals. If, after moving on, marine mammals remain within 1 nm, SWFSC may decide to move again or to skip the station. SWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision but may not elect to conduct pelagic longline survey activity when animals remain within the 1-nm zone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> SWFSC shall maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of gear deployment and retrieval. If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully deployed or retrieved, SWFSC shall take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. SWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If deployment or retrieval operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, SWFSC may resume such operations when practicable only when the animals are believed to have departed the 1 nm area. SWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> SWFSC shall implement standard survey protocols, including maximum soak durations and a prohibition on chumming.</p>
