A superseding bond shall be filed immediately in case of the insolvency of the surety. If a bond is found to be not acceptable or for any reason becomes invalid or of no effect, the principal shall immediately file a satisfactory superseding bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A bond filed under this section to supersede an existing bond shall be marked by the obligors at the time of execution, ``Superseding Bond.'' When such a bond is approved, the superseded bond shall be released as to transactions occurring wholly subsequent to the effective date of the superseding bond, and notice of termination of the superseded bond shall be issued, as provided in Sec. 17.111.</p><p class="depth2">Termination of Bonds</p>
