                                Sec. 5.109  Equal Participation of Religious Organizations in HUD
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Consistent with Executive Order 13279 (issued on December 12, 2002, 67 FR 77141, 3 CFR, 2002 Comp., p. 258), entitled ``Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations,'' this section describes HUD's policy for the equal participation of religious organizations in HUD's programs and activities. The equal participation policies and requirements contained in this section are generally applicable to religious organizations in all HUD programs and activities. More specific policies and requirements regarding the participation of religious organizations in individual HUD programs may be provided in the regulations for those programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Equal participation of religious organizations in HUD programs and activities. Religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in HUD's programs and activities. Neither the Federal government, nor a State or local government, nor any other entity that administers any HUD program or activity shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inherently religious activities. Organizations that receive direct HUD funds under a HUD program or activity may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the programs or services funded under a HUD program or activity. If an organization conducts such inherently religious activities, the inherently religious activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs, activities, or services supported by direct HUD funds and participation must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of the programs, activities or services provided under the HUD program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Independence of religious organizations. A religious organization that participates in a HUD program or activity will retain its independence from Federal, State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not engage in any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization as part of the programs or services supported by direct HUD funds. Among other things, religious organizations may use space in their facilities to provide services under a HUD program without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a religious organization participating in a HUD program retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's

name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption from Title VII employment discrimination requirements. A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1), is not forfeited when the organization participates in a HUD program. Some HUD programs, however, contain independent statutory provisions that impose certain nondiscrimination requirements on all grantees. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nondiscrimination requirements. An organization that receives direct HUD funds shall not, in providing program assistance, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of structures. HUD funds may not be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those structures are used for inherently religious activities. HUD funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under a HUD program or activity. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently religious activities, HUD funds may not exceed the cost of those portions of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to the HUD program or activity. Sanctuaries, chapels, and other rooms that a HUD-funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of worship, however, are ineligible for HUD-funded improvements. Disposition of real property after use for the authorized purpose, or any change in use of the property from the authorized purpose, is subject to governmentwide regulations governing real property disposition (see, e.g., 24 CFR parts 84 and 85).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Commingling of Federal and State and local funds. If a state or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement Federally funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, the requirements of this section apply to all of the commingled funds. Further, if a State or local government is required to contribute matching funds to supplement a Federally funded activity, the matching funds are considered commingled with the Federal assistance and therefore subject to the requirements of this section. Some HUD programs' requirements govern any project or activity assisted under those programs. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.
