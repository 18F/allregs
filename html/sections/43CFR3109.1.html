                            <p class="depth0">The Act of May 21, 1930 (30 U.S.C. 301-306), authorizes either the leasing of oil and gas deposits under railroad and other rights-of-way to the owner of the right-of-way or the entering of a compensatory royalty agreement with adjoining landowners. This authority shall be exercised only with respect to railroad rights-of-way and easements issued pursuant either to the Act of March 3, 1875 (43 U.S.C. 934 et seq.), or pursuant to earlier railroad right-of-way statutes, and with respect to rights-of-way and easements issued pursuant to the Act of March 3, 1891 (43 U.S.C. 946 et seq.). The oil and gas underlying any other right-of-way or easement is included within any oil and gas lease issued pursuant to the Act which covers the lands within the right-of-way, subject to the limitations on use of the surface, if any, set out in the statute under which, or permit by which, the right-of-way or easement

was issued, and such oil and gas shall not be leased under the Act of May 21, 1930.


Sec. 3109.1-2  Application.</p><p class="depth0">No approved form is required for an application to lease oil and gas deposits underlying a right-of-way. The right-of-way owner or his/her transferee must file the application in the proper BLM office. Include the processing fee for leasing under right-of-way found in the fee schedule in Sec. 3000.12 of this chapter. If the transferee files an application, it must also include an executed transfer of the right to obtain a lease. The application shall detail the facts as to the ownership of the right-of-way, and of the transfer if the application is filed by a transferee; the development of oil or gas in adjacent or nearby lands, the location and depth of the wells, the production and the probability of drainage of the deposits in the right-of-way. A description by metes and bounds of the right-of-way is not required but each legal subdivision through which a portion of the right-of-way desired to be leased extends shall be described.

Sec. 3109.1-3  Notice.</p><p class="depth0">After the Bureau of Land Management has determined that a lease of a right-of-way or any portion thereof is consistent with the public interest, either upon consideration of an application for lease or on its own motion, the authorized officer shall serve notice on the owner or lessee of the oil and gas rights of the adjoining lands. The adjoining land owner or lessee shall be allowed a reasonable time, as provided in the notice, within which to submit a bid for the amount or percent of compensatory royalty, the owner or lessee shall pay for the extraction of the oil and gas underlying the right-of-way through wells on such adjoining lands. The owner of the right-of-way shall be given the same time period to submit a bid for the lease.
