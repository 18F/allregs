                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The topple test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Containers design types.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special preparation for the topple test. Flexible Bulk Container design types must be filled to their maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test method. Samples of all Flexible Bulk Container design types must be toppled onto any part of its top by lifting the side furthest from the drop edge upon a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. This test surface must be large enough to be immovable during testing and sufficiently large enough to ensure that the test Flexible Bulk Container falls entirely upon the surface. The test surface must be kept free from local defects capable of influencing the test results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Topple height. (1) For all Flexible Bulk Containers, topple heights are specified as follows: Packing group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Criterion for passing the test. For all Flexible Bulk Container design types there may be no loss of the filling substance. However a slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered a failure of the Flexible Bulk Container.</p>
