switch points or by switch locking mechanism, or through relay controlled by such circuit controller, for each switch, movable-point frog, and derail in the routes governed by such signal. Circuits shall be arranged so that such signal can display an aspect more favorable than ``proceed at restricted speed,'' only when each switch, movable-point frog, and derail in the route is in proper position.</p>
