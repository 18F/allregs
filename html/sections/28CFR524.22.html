                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Wardens are to ensure each committed youth offender is scheduled  for a three-phase program plan which will include a classification  phase, a treatment phase, and a pre-release phase. A program plan for  each YCA inmate will be developed by the Unit Team as a part of the  classification phase. The Warden may exempt a YCA inmate from program  participation when individual circumstances warrant such exceptions.  Such exceptions must be requested and acknowledged by the inmate, and  the reason(s) for exemption must be documented in the inmate's central  file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Classification phase: The classification phase begins upon the  inmate's arrival at the designated institution. It consists of  evaluation, orientation, unit assignment, and concludes when the inmate  has attended the initial classification (or transfer classification)  meeting with the Unit Team. YCA inmates are to participate in the  classification process prior to the development of their individual  program plans. The YCA inmate is to have received a psychological  screening prior to attending the initial classification meeting. YCA  program plans will include specific goals relative to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Behavior;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment/self improvement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Pre-release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment phase: YCA inmates are to be exposed to unit-based and  community-based (if otherwise eligible) programs. Each YCA inmate shall  be periodically reviewed during this phase. The treatment phase begins  when the inmate attends the programs and activities described in the  program plan which were established at the culmination of the  classification phase. Each YCA inmate shall be assigned programs in  accordance with the inmate's needs and the established program plan. The  ``program day'' shall consist of morning, afternoon, and evening time  periods, during which the inmate shall be scheduled for treatment  programs, work, and leisure-time activities. The inmate shall be  expected to comply with the program   plan. The inmate's participation in a treatment program is required, not  optional. An inmate's failure to participate may result in disciplinary  action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pre-release phase: The YCA inmate shall enter the pre-release  phase approximately 9 months prior to release. The pre-release phase is  ordinarily divided into two segments: participation in the institution  pre-release program and a stay at a Community Corrections Center (CCC),  if otherwise eligible. Institution pre-release programs shall focus on  the types of problems the inmate may face upon return to the community,  such as re-establishing family relationships, managing a household,  finding and keeping a job, and developing a successful life style. In  addition, the pre-release phase may include visits from prospective  employers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Staff shall establish incentives to motivate YCA inmates and to  encourage program completion. Examples of such incentives which may be  used are special recognition, awards, and ``vacation days''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The program plan, and the YCA inmate's participation in  fulfilling goals contained within the plan, are fundamental factors  considered by the U.S. Parole Commission in determining when a YCA  inmate should be paroled. Given the importance and joint use of the YCA  programming process, the current program plan and a summary of the  inmate's progress in meeting established treatment goals must be made  available for review and discussion by the Commission at each parole  hearing. In addition, a staff member familiar with the YCA inmate's case  should be present at any parole hearing to clarify any questions  concerning the plan or the inmate's progress in completing the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon full and satisfactory completion of the program plan, the  Warden will notify the U.S. Parole Commission and make a specific  recommendation for release.</p>
