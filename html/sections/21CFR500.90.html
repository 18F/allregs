                            <p class="depth0">In response to a petition or on the Commissioner's own initiative,  the Commissioner may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of  this subpart except those provided under Sec. 500.88. A petition for  this waiver may be filed by any person who would be adversely affected  by the application of the requirements to a particular compound. The  petition shall explain and document why the requirements from which a  waiver is requested are not reasonably applicable to the compound, and  set forth clearly the reasons why the alternative procedures will  provide the basis for concluding that approval of the compound satisfies  the requirements of the anticancer provisions of the act. If the  Commissioner determines that waiver of any of the requirements of this  subpart is appropriate, the Commissioner will state the basis for that  determination in the regulation approving marketing of the sponsored  compound.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0910-0228)</p>
