                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The permittee shall comply and shall be responsible for the  compliance of its officials, employees, contractors, subcontractors and  agents with the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of  its special use permit, the provisions of its approved exploration plan  and plan or operation, and all reasonable stipulations, demands and  orders issued by the Regional Director. All actions by the permittee  inconsistent with this part are prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The permittee shall designate a general representative who shall  be the person primarily accountable for managing the permittee's  authorized activities, and a field representative who shall be the  person primarily accountable for supervising the permittee's field  operations, and their alternates. The Regional Director shall be  informed of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the persons  designated pursuant to this paragraph and of the procedures for  contacting them on a 24-hour basis, including the radio frequency for  field operations, at the time the permittee submits its first plan of  operation pursuant to Sec.  37.24. The permittee shall notify the  Regional Director promptly of any changes in such personnel or the  procedures for contacting them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Field operations shall be conducted by the permittee or a  designee approved by the Regional Director. Assignment of a designee  shall be in a manner and form acceptable to the Regional Director. The  Regional Director shall approve or disapprove a permittee's designee  within 30 days following the receipt of such information as the Regional  Director may require from the permittee and designee in order to reach  his decision. Acceptance of a designee to act for the permittee in  matters relating to the conduct of exploratory activities does not  relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with applicable  laws, its special use permit, exploration plan, plan of operation, and  all reasonable stipulations, demands and orders of the Regional  Director. The designee will be considered the agent of the permittee and  will be responsible for complying fully with the obligations of the  permittee. The serving of stipulations, demands, orders, and notices on  the permittee's designee, when delivered personally or by radio or mail,  will be deemed to be service upon the permittee. The permittee shall  notify the Regional Director in writing when assignment of a designee  has been cancelled. A designee cannot reassign its designation to  another party. The permittee or designee shall notify the Regional  Director 10 working days in advance of its intention to commence field  operations for each season that it conducts exploratory activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The permittee shall submit to the Regional Director 30 days  prior to the commencement of field operations for each year covered by  its exploration plan an updated list of the names and addresses of all  persons participating in the exploratory activities covered thereby or  sharing in the data and information resulting therefrom through a cost- sharing or any other arrangement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The permittee shall perform operations and maintain equipment in  a safe and workmanlike manner. The permittee shall take all reasonable  precautions necessary to provide adequate protection for the health and  safety of life and the protection of property and to comply with any  health and safety requirements prescribed by the Regional Director.</p>
