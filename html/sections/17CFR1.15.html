A request for exemption filed under this paragraph (c)(2) shall explain the basis for the designation of a particular futures commission merchant as the Reporting Futures Commission Merchant and will become effective on the thirtieth day after receipt of such request by the Commission unless the Commission objects to the request by that date. The Reporting Futures Commission Merchant must submit the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section on behalf of its affiliated futures commission merchants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may exempt any futures commission merchant from any provision of this section if it finds that the exemption is not contrary to the public interest and the purposes of the

Sec. 240.17h-1T and 240.17h-2T of this title, the futures commission must also designate any such affiliated person as a Material Affiliated Person on the organizational chart required as Item 1 of part I of Form 17-H. To comply with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of this section, such futures commission merchant may, at its option, file Form 17-H in its entirety or file such form without the information required under part II of Form 17-H.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a futures commission merchant which is required to file, or has a Material Affiliated Person which is required to file, Form 17-H (or such other forms or reports as may be required) with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sec. 240.17h-2T of this title, or such other risk assessment regulations as the Securities and Exchange Commission may adopt, such futures commission merchant shall be deemed to be in compliance with the reporting requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of this section if the futures commission merchant furnishes, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a copy of the most recent Form 17-H filed by the futures commission merchant or its Material Affiliated Person with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided however, that if the futures commission merchant has designated any of its affiliated persons as Material Affiliated Persons for purposes of this section and Sec. 1.14 which are not designated as Material Associated Persons for purposes of the Form 17-H filed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 240.17h-1T and 240.17h-2T of this title, the futures commission must also designate any such affiliated person as a Material Affiliated Person on the organizational chart required as Item 1 of part I of Form 17-H.

Federal banking agency shall be deemed confidential for the purposes of section 8 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The furnishing of any information or documents by a futures commission merchant pursuant to this section shall not constitute an admission for any purpose that a Material Affiliated Person is otherwise subject to the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special provisions with respect to Material Affiliated Persons subject to the supervision of a Foreign Regulatory Authority. A futures commission merchant shall be deemed to be in compliance with the reporting requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to a Material Affiliated Person if such futures commission merchant furnishes, or causes such Material Affiliated Person to make available, in accordance with the provisions of this section, copies of any financial or risk exposure reports filed by such Material Affiliated Person with a foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The futures commission merchant agrees to use its best efforts to obtain from the Material Affiliated Person and to cause the Material Affiliated Person to provide, directly or through its foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority, any supplemental information the Commission may request and there is no statute or other bar in the foreign jurisdiction that would preclude the futures commission merchant, the Material Affiliated Person, the foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority from providing such information to the Commission; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority with whom the Material Affiliated Person files such reports has entered into an information sharing agreement with the Commission which is in effect as of the futures commission merchant's fiscal year-end and which will allow the Commission to obtain the type of information required herein. The futures commission merchant shall file a copy of the original report and a copy translated into the English language. For the purposes of this section, the term ``Foreign Futures Authority'' shall have the meaning set forth in section 1a(10) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Confidentiality.
