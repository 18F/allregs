For the purposes of this subpart, Sec. 434.61 requires compliance with applicable BPT, BAT, BCT, and NSPS effluent limitations in subparts C, D, and F of this part. Section 434.61 applies to the commingled waste stream only during the time when the pre-existing discharge is intercepted by active mining or is commingled with active mine wastewater for treatment or discharge. After commingling has ceased, the pre-existing discharge is subject to the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In situations where coal remining operations seek reissuance of an existing remining permit with BPJ limitations and the regulatory authority determines that it is not feasible for a remining operator to re-establish baseline pollutant levels in accordance with the statistical procedures contained in appendix B of this part, pre-existing discharge limitations at existing remining operations shall remain subject to baseline pollutant levels established during the original permit application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The effluent limitations in this subpart apply to pre-existing discharges until the appropriate SMCRA authority has authorized bond release.</p>
