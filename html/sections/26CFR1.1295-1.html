A shareholder's section 1295 election does not apply to any option to buy stock of the PFIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of general rules to stock held by a pass through entity--(i) Stock subject to a section 1295 election transferred to a pass through entity. A shareholder's section 1295 election will not apply to a domestic pass through entity to which the shareholder transfers stock subject to section 1295 election, or to any other U.S. person that is an interest holder or beneficiary of the domestic pass through entity. However, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section (relating to a transfer to a domestic pass through entity of stock subject to a section 1295 election), a shareholder that transfers stock subject to a section 1295 election to a pass through entity will continue to be subject to the section 1295 election with

respect to the stock indirectly owned through the pass through entity and any other stock of that PFIC owned by the shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stock subject to a section 1295 election transferred to a pass through entity. A shareholder's section 1295 election will not apply to a domestic pass through entity to which the shareholder transfers stock subject to section 1295 election, or to any other U.S. person that is an interest holder or beneficiary of the domestic pass through entity. However, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section (relating to a transfer to a domestic pass through entity of stock subject to a section 1295 election), a shareholder that transfers stock subject to a section 1295 election to a pass through entity will continue to be subject to the section 1295 election with

respect to the stock indirectly owned through the pass through entity and any other stock of that PFIC owned by the shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitation on application of pass through entity's section 1295 election. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a section 1295 election made by a domestic pass through entity does not apply to other stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the interest holder or beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect of partnership termination on section 1295 election. Termination of a section 1295 election made by a domestic partnership by reason of the termination of the partnership under section 708(b) will not terminate the section 1295 election with respect to partners of the terminated partnership that are partners of the new partnership. Except as otherwise provided, the stock of the PFIC of which the new partners are indirect shareholders will be treated as stock of a QEF only if the new domestic partnership makes a section 1295 election with respect to that stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Characterization of stock held through a pass through entity. Stock of a PFIC held through a pass through entity will be treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF with respect to an interest holder or beneficiary only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of PFIC stock acquired (other than in a transaction in which gain is not recognized pursuant to regulations under section 1291(f) with respect to that stock) and held by a domestic pass through entity, the pass through entity makes the section 1295 election and the PFIC has been a QEF with respect to the pass through entity for all taxable years that are included wholly or partly in the pass through entity's holding period of the PFIC stock and during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC within the meaning of Sec. 1.1291-9(j)(1); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of PFIC stock transferred by an interest holder or beneficiary to a pass through entity in a transaction in which gain is not fully recognized (including pursuant to regulations under section 1291(f)), the pass through entity makes the section 1295 election with respect to the PFIC stock transferred for the taxable year in which the transfer was made. The PFIC stock transferred will be treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF by the pass through entity, however, only if that stock was treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF with respect to the interest holder or beneficiary at the time of the transfer, and the PFIC has been a QEF with respect to the pass through entity for all taxable years of the PFIC that are included wholly or partly in the pass through entity's holding period of the PFIC stock during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC within the meaning of Sec. 1.1291-9(j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Characterization of stock distributed by a partnership. In the case of PFIC stock distributed by a partnership to a partner in a transaction in which gain is not fully recognized, the PFIC stock will be treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF by the partners only if that stock was treated as stock of a pedigreed QEF with respect to the partnership for all taxable years of the PFIC that are included wholly or partly in the partnership's holding period of the PFIC stock during which the foreign corporation was a PFIC within the meaning of Sec. 1.1291-9(j), and the partner has a section 1295 election in effect with respect to the distributed PFIC stock for the partner's taxable year in which the distribution was made. If the partner does not have a section 1295 election in effect, the stock shall be treated as stock in a section 1291 fund. See paragraph (k) of this section for special applicability date of paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Application of general rules to a taxpayer filing a joint return under section 6013. A section 1295 election made by a taxpayer in a joint return, within the meaning of section 6013, will be treated as also made by the spouse that joins in the filing of that return. See paragraph (k) of this section for special applicability date of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect of section 1295 election--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the effect of a shareholder's section 1295 election is to treat the foreign corporation as a QEF with respect to the shareholder for each taxable year of the foreign corporation ending with or within a taxable year of the shareholder for which the election is effective. A section 1295

election is effective for the shareholder's election year and all subsequent taxable years of the shareholder unless invalidated, terminated or revoked as provided in paragraph (i) of this section. The terms shareholder and shareholder's election year are defined in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the effect of a shareholder's section 1295 election is to treat the foreign corporation as a QEF with respect to the shareholder for each taxable year of the foreign corporation ending with or within a taxable year of the shareholder for which the election is effective. A section 1295

election is effective for the shareholder's election year and all subsequent taxable years of the shareholder unless invalidated, terminated or revoked as provided in paragraph (i) of this section. The terms shareholder and shareholder's election year are defined in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Years to which section 1295 election applies--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a foreign corporation with respect to which a section 1295 election is made will be treated as a QEF for its taxable year ending with or within the shareholder's election year and all subsequent taxable years of the foreign corporation that are included wholly or partly in the shareholder's holding period (or periods) of stock of the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), a foreign corporation with respect to which a section 1295 election is made will be treated as a QEF for its taxable year ending with or within the shareholder's election year and all subsequent taxable years of the foreign corporation that are included wholly or partly in the shareholder's holding period (or periods) of stock of the foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of PFIC status on election. A foreign corporation will not be treated as a QEF for any taxable year of the foreign corporation that the foreign corporation is not a PFIC under section 1297(a) and is not treated as a PFIC under section 1298(b)(1). Therefore, a shareholder shall not be required to include pursuant to section 1293 the shareholder's pro rata share of ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year and shall not be required to satisfy the section 1295 annual reporting requirement of paragraph (f)(2) of this section for such year. Cessation of a foreign corporation's status as a PFIC will not, however, terminate a section 1295 election. Thus, if the foreign corporation is a PFIC in any taxable year after a year in which it is not treated as a PFIC, the shareholder's original election under section 1295 continues to apply and the shareholder must take into account its pro rata share of ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year and comply with the section 1295 annual reporting requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effect on election of complete termination of a shareholder's interest in the PFIC. Complete termination of a shareholder's direct and indirect interest in stock of a foreign corporation will not terminate a shareholder's section 1295 election with respect to the foreign corporation. Therefore, if a shareholder reacquires a direct or indirect interest in any stock of the foreign corporation, that stock is considered to be stock for which an election under section 1295 has been made and the shareholder is subject to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of a shareholder of a QEF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effect on section 1295 election of transfer of stock to a domestic pass through entity. The transfer of a shareholder's direct or indirect interest in stock of a foreign corporation to a domestic pass through entity (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) will not terminate the shareholder's section 1295 election with respect to the foreign corporation, whether or not the pass through entity makes a section 1295 election. For the rules concerning the application of section 1293 to stock transferred to a domestic pass through entity, see Sec. 1.1293-1(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1998, C, a U.S. person, purchased stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. Both FC and C are calendar year taxpayers. C made a timely section 1295 election to treat FC as a QEF in C's 1998 return, and FC was therefore a pedigreed QEF. C included its shares of FC's 1998 ordinary earnings and net capital gain in C's 1998 Income and did not make a section 1294 election to defer the time for payment of tax on that income. In 1999, 2000, and 2001, FC did not satisfy either the income or asset test of section 1296(a), and therefore was neither a PFIC nor a QEF. C therefore did not have to include its pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of FC pursuant to section 1293, or satisfy the section 1295 annual reporting requirements for any of those years. FC qualified as a PFIC again in 2002. Because C had made a section 1295 election in 1998, and the election had not been invalidated, terminated, or revoked, within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section, C's section 1295 election remains in effect for 2002. C therefore is subject in 2002 to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that FC did not lose PFIC status in any year and C sold all the FC stock in 1999 and repurchased stock of FC in 2002. Because C had made a section 1295 election in 1998 with respect to stock of FC, and the election had not been invalidated, terminated, or revoked, within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section, C's section 1295 election remained in effect and therefore applies to the stock of FC purchased by C in

2002. C therefore is subject in 2002 to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2) except that C is a partner in domestic partnership P and C transferred its FC stock to P in 1999. Because C had made a section 1295 election in 1998 with respect to stock of FC, and the election had not been invalidated, terminated, or revoked, within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section, C's section 1295 election remains in effect with respect to its indirect interest in the stock of FC. If P does not make the section 1295 election with respect to the FC stock, C will continue to be subject, in C's capacity as an indirect shareholder of FC, to the income inclusion and reporting rules required of shareholders of QEFs in 1999 and subsequent years for that portion of the FC stock C is treated as owning indirectly through the partnership. If P makes the section 1295 election, C will take into account its pro rata shares of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the FC under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Who may make a section 1295 election--(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), any U.S. person that is a shareholder (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) of a PFIC, including a shareholder that holds stock of a PFIC in bearer form, may make a section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The shareholder need not own directly or indirectly any stock of the PFIC at the time the shareholder makes the section 1295 election provided the shareholder is a shareholder of the PFIC during the taxable year of the PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the shareholder for which the section 1295 election is made. Except in the case of a shareholder that is an exempt organization that may not make a section 1295 election, as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, in a chain of ownership only the first U.S. person that is a shareholder of the PFIC may make the section 1295 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), any U.S. person that is a shareholder (as defined in paragraph (j) of this section) of a PFIC, including a shareholder that holds stock of a PFIC in bearer form, may make a section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The shareholder need not own directly or indirectly any stock of the PFIC at the time the shareholder makes the section 1295 election provided the shareholder is a shareholder of the PFIC during the taxable year of the PFIC that ends with or within the taxable year of the shareholder for which the section 1295 election is made. Except in the case of a shareholder that is an exempt organization that may not make a section 1295 election, as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, in a chain of ownership only the first U.S. person that is a shareholder of the PFIC may make the section 1295 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of general rule to pass through entities--(i) Partnerships--(A) Domestic partnership. A domestic partnership that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with request to that PFIC. The partnership election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the partnership and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any partner. As provided in Sec. 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in the partnership take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares owned by the partnership under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partnerships--(A) Domestic partnership. A domestic partnership that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with request to that PFIC. The partnership election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the partnership and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any partner. As provided in Sec. 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in the partnership take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares owned by the partnership under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Domestic partnership. A domestic partnership that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with request to that PFIC. The partnership election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the partnership and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any partner. As provided in Sec. 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in the partnership take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares owned by the partnership under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Foreign partnership. A U.S. person that holds an interest in a foreign partnership that, in turn, holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. A partner's election applies to the stock of the PFIC owned directly or indirectly by the foreign partnership and to any other stock of the PFIC owned by that partner. A section 1295 election by a partner applies only to that partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S corporation. An S corporation that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The S corporation election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the S corporation and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any S corporation shareholder. As provided in Sec. 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in the S corporation take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trust or estate--(A) Domestic trust or estate--(1) Nongrantor trust or estate. A domestic nongrantor trust or a domestic estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. The trust or estate's election applies only to the stock of the PFIC held directly or indirectly by the trust or estate and not to any other stock held directly or indirectly by any beneficiary. As provided in Sec. 1.1293-1(c)(1), shareholders owning stock of a QEF by reason of an interest in a domestic trust or estate take into account the section 1293 inclusions with respect to the QEF shares under the rules applicable to inclusions of income from the trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grantor trust. A U.S. person that is treated under sections 671 through 678

as the owner of the portion of a domestic trust that owns an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. If that person ceases to be treated as the owner of the portion of the trust that owns an interest in the PFIC stock and is a beneficiary of the trust, that person's section 1295 election will continue to apply to the PFIC stock indirectly owned by that person under the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section as if the person had transferred its interest in the PFIC stock to the trust. However, the stock will be treated as stock of a PFIC that is not a QEF with respect to other beneficiaries of the trust, unless the trust makes the section 1295 election as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Foreign trust or estate--(1) Nongrantor trust or estate. A U.S. person that is a beneficiary of a foreign nongrantor trust or estate that holds an interest in stock of a PFIC makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. A beneficiary's section 1295 election applies to all the PFIC stock owned directly and indirectly by the trust or estate and to the other PFIC stock owned directly or indirectly by the beneficiary. A section 1295 election by a beneficiary applies only to that beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grantor trust. A U.S. person that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as the owner of the portion of a foreign trust that owns an interest in stock of a PFIC stock makes the section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. If that person ceases to be treated as the owner of the portion of the trust that owns an interest in the PFIC stock and is a beneficiary of the trust, that person's section 1295 election will continue to apply to the PFIC stock indirectly owned by that person under the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. However, as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)(1) of this section, any other shareholder that is a beneficiary of the trust and that wishes to treat the PFIC as a QEF must make the section 1295 election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Indirect ownership of the pass through entity or the PFIC. The rules of this paragraph (d)(2) apply whether or not the shareholder holds its interest in the pass through entity directly or indirectly and whether or not the pass through entity holds its interest in the PFIC directly or indirectly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect ownership of a PFIC through other PFICs--(i) In general. An election under section 1295 shall apply only to the foreign corporation for which an election is made. Therefore, if a shareholder makes an election under section 1295 to treat a PFIC as a QEF, that election applies only to stock in that foreign corporation and not to the stock in any other corporation which the shareholder is treated as owning by virtue of its ownership of stock in the QEF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An election under section 1295 shall apply only to the foreign corporation for which an election is made. Therefore, if a shareholder makes an election under section 1295 to treat a PFIC as a QEF, that election applies only to stock in that foreign corporation and not to the stock in any other corporation which the shareholder is treated as owning by virtue of its ownership of stock in the QEF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1988, T, a U.S. person, purchased stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. FC also owns the stock of SC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. T makes an election under section 1295 to treat FC as a QEF. T's section 1295 election applies only to the stock T owns in FC, and does not apply to the stock T indirectly owns in SC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Member of consolidated return group as shareholder. Pursuant to Sec. 1.1502-77(a), the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that join in filing a consolidated income tax return makes a section 1295 election for all members of the affiliated group. An election by a common parent will be effective for all members of the affiliated group with respect to interests in PFIC stock held at the time the election is made or at any time thereafter. A separate election must be made by the common parent for each PFIC of which a member of the affiliated group is a shareholder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Option holder. A holder of an option to acquire stock of a PFIC may not make a section 1295 election that will apply to the option or to the stock subject to the option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exempt organization. A tax-exempt organization that is not taxable under section 1291, pursuant to Sec. 1.1291-1(e), with respect to a PFIC may not make a section 1295 election with respect to that PFIC. In addition, such an exempt organization will not be subject to any section 1295 election made by a domestic pass through entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time for making a section 1295 election--(1) In general. Except as provided

in Sec. 1.1295-3, a shareholder making the section 1295 election must make the election on or before the due date, as extended under section 6081 (election due date), for filing the shareholder's income tax return for the first taxable year to which the election will apply. The section 1295 election must be made in the original return for that year, or in an amended return, provided the amended return is filed on or before the election due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided

in Sec. 1.1295-3, a shareholder making the section 1295 election must make the election on or before the due date, as extended under section 6081 (election due date), for filing the shareholder's income tax return for the first taxable year to which the election will apply. The section 1295 election must be made in the original return for that year, or in an amended return, provided the amended return is filed on or before the election due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1998, C, a domestic corporation, purchased stock of FC, a foreign corporation that is a PFIC. Both C and FC are calendar year taxpayers. C wishes to make the section 1295 election for its taxable year ended December 31, 1998. The section 1295 election must be made on or before March 15, 1999, the due date of C's 1998 income tax return as provided by section 6072(b). On March 14, 1999, C files a request for a three-month extension of time to file its 1998 income tax return under section 6081(b). C's time to file its 1998 income tax return and to make the section 1295 election is thereby extended to June 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that on May 1, 1999, C filed its 1998 income tax return and failed to include the section 1295 election. C may file an amended income tax return for 1998 to make the section 1295 election provided the amended return is filed on or before the extended due date of June 15, 1999.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Manner of making a section 1295 election and the annual election requirements of the shareholder--(1) Manner of making the election. A shareholder must make a section 1295 election by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manner of making the election. A shareholder must make a section 1295 election by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Completing Form 8621 in the manner required by that form and this section for making the section 1295 election;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Attaching Form 8621 to its Federal income tax return filed by the election due date for the shareholder's election year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Receiving and reflecting in Form 8621 the information provided in the PFIC Annual Information Statement described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Annual Intermediary Statement described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or the applicable combined statement described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, for the taxable year of the PFIC ending with or within the taxable year for which Form 8621 is being filed. If the PFIC Annual Information Statement contains a statement described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, the shareholder must attach a statement to Form 8621 that indicates that the shareholder rather than the PFIC calculated the PFIC's ordinary earnings and net capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annual election requirements--(i) In general.

Corp Y, a domestic corporation, owns directly 100 shares of marketable stock in foreign corporation FX, a PFIC. Corp Y also owns a 50 percent interest in FP, a foreign partnership that owns 200 shares of FX stock. Accordingly, under section 1298(a)(3) and Sec. 1.1296-1(e)(1), Corp Y is treated as indirectly owning 100 shares of FX stock. Corp Y also owns 100 percent of the stock of FZ, a foreign corporation that is not a PFIC. FZ owns 100 shares of FX stock, and therefore under section 1298(a)(2)(A), Corp Y is treated as owning the 100 shares of FX stock owned by FZ. For taxable year 2005, Corp Y has a QEF election in effect with respect to all 300 shares of FX stock that it owns directly or indirectly. See generally Sec. 1.1295-1(c)(1). For taxable year 2006, Corp Y makes a timely election pursuant to section 1296 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of section 1296, Corp Y is treated as owning stock held indirectly through a partnership, but not through a foreign corporation. Section 1296(g); Sec. 1.1296-1(e)(1). Accordingly, Corp Y's section 1296 election covers the 100 shares it owns directly and the 100 shares it owns indirectly through FP, but not the 100 shares owned by FZ. With respect to the first 200 shares, Corp Y's QEF election is automatically terminated effective December 31, 2005. With respect to the 100 shares Corp Y owns through foreign FZ, Corp Y's QEF election remains in effect unless invalidated, terminated, or revoked pursuant to this paragraph (i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effect of invalidation, termination, or revocation. An invalidation, termination, or revocation of a section 1295 election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Terminates all section 1294 elections, as provided in Sec. 1.1294-1T(e), and the undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability and interest thereon are due by the due date, without regard to extensions, for the return for the last taxable year of the shareholder to which the section 1295 election applies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the Commissioner's discretion, results in a deemed sale of the QEF stock on the last day of the PFIC's last taxable year as a QEF, in which gain, but not loss, will be recognized and with respect to which appropriate basis

Except as otherwise provided, paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (c) through (j) of this section are applicable to taxable years of shareholders beginning after December 31, 1997. However, taxpayers may apply the rules under paragraphs (b)(4), (f) and (g) of this section to a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1998, provided the statute of limitations on the assessment of tax has not expired as of April 27, 1998, and, in the case of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the taxpayers who filed the joint return have consistently applied the rules of that section to all taxable years following the year the election was made. Paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section is applicable as of February 7, 2000, however, a taxpayer may apply the rules to a taxable year prior to the applicable date provided the statute of limitations on the assessment of tax for that taxable year has not expired. Paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(5)(ii) of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning on or after May 3, 2004.
