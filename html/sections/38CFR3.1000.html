                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic entitlement. Except as provided in Sec. Sec.  3.1001 and 3.1008, where death occurred on or after December 1, 1962, periodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemembers' indemnity) authorized under laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, to which a payee was entitled at his or her death under existing ratings or decisions or those based on evidence in the file at date of death, and due and unpaid will, upon the death of such person, be paid as follows:

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the death of a veteran to the living person first listed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> His or her spouse;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> His or her children (in equal shares);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> His or her dependent parents (in equal shares) or the surviving parent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon the death of a surviving spouse or remarried surviving spouse, to the veteran's children.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon the death of a child, to the surviving children of the veteran entitled to death pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon the death of a child claiming benefits under chapter 18 of this title, to the surviving parents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In all other cases, only so much of the accrued benefit may be paid as may be necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial. (See Sec.  3.1002.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Apportionments. (1) Upon the death of a person receiving an apportioned share of benefits payable to a veteran, all or any part of such unpaid amount is payable to the veteran or to any other dependent or dependents of the veteran.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(a)(1))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon the death of a person receiving an apportioned share of benefits payable to a veteran, all or any part of such unpaid amount is payable to the veteran or to any other dependent or dependents of the veteran.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(a)(1))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where at the date of death of the veteran an apportioned share is being paid to or has been withheld on behalf of another person, the apportioned amount remaining unpaid for periods prior to the last day of the month before the veteran's death is payable to the apportionee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the accrued death pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation was payable for a child as an apportioned share of the surviving spouse's benefit, payment will be made under the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, on the expenses of such deceased child's last sickness or burial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claims and evidence. Application for accrued benefits must be filed within 1 year after the date of death. A claim for death pension, compensation,

or dependency and indemnity compensation, by an apportionee, surviving spouse, child or parent is deemed to include claim for any accrued benefits. (See Sec.  3.152(b)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an application for accrued benefits is incomplete because the claimant has not furnished information necessary to establish that he or she is within the category of eligible persons under the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) or paragraph (b) of this section and that circumstances exist which make the claimant the specific person entitled to payment of all or part of any benefits which may have accrued, VA shall notify the claimant:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Of the type of information required to complete the application;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That VA will take no further action on the claim unless VA receives the required information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That if VA does not receive the required information within 1 year of the date of the original VA notification of information required, no benefits will be awarded on the basis of that application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to file timely claim, or a waiver of rights, by a preferred dependent will not serve to vest title in a person in a lower class or a claimant for reimbursement; neither will such failure or waiver by a person or persons in a joint class serve to increase the amount payable to another or others in the class.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5121(c); 5112(b))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. (1) Spouse means the surviving spouse of the veteran, whose marriage meets the requirements of Sec.  3.1(j) or Sec.  3.52.
