                                Sec. 351.213  Administrative review of orders and suspension
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. As noted in Sec. 351.212(a), the United States has a ``retrospective'' assessment system under which final liability for antidumping and countervailing duties is determined after merchandise is imported. Although duty liability may be determined in the context of other types of reviews, the most frequently used procedure for determining final duty liability is the administrative review procedure under section 751(a)(1) of the Act. This section contains rules regarding requests for administrative reviews and the conduct of such reviews.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Request for administrative review. (1) Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, a domestic interested party or an interested party described in section 771(9)(B) of the Act (foreign government) may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review under section 751(a)(1) of the Act of specified individual exporters or producers covered by an order (except for a countervailing duty order in which the investigation or prior administrative review was conducted on an aggregate basis), if the requesting person states why the person desires the

Secretary to review those particular exporters or producers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, a domestic interested party or an interested party described in section 771(9)(B) of the Act (foreign government) may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review under section 751(a)(1) of the Act of specified individual exporters or producers covered by an order (except for a countervailing duty order in which the investigation or prior administrative review was conducted on an aggregate basis), if the requesting person states why the person desires the

Secretary to review those particular exporters or producers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the same month, an exporter or producer covered by an order (except for a countervailing duty order in which the investigation or prior administrative review was conducted on an aggregate basis) may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review of only that person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the same month, an importer of the merchandise may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review of only an exporter or producer (except for a countervailing duty order in which the investigation or prior administrative review was conducted on an aggregate basis) of the subject merchandise imported by that importer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of a suspension of investigation, an interested party may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review of all producers or exporters covered by an agreement on which the suspension of investigation was based.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deferral of administrative review--(1) In general. The Secretary may defer the initiation of an administrative review, in whole or in part, for one year if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Secretary may defer the initiation of an administrative review, in whole or in part, for one year if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The request for administrative review is accompanied by a request that the Secretary defer the review, in whole or in part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> None of the following persons objects to the deferral: the exporter or producer for which deferral is requested, an importer of subject merchandise of that exporter or producer, a domestic interested party and, in a countervailing duty proceeding, the foreign government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timeliness of objection to deferral. An objection to a deferral of the initiation of administrative review under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section must be submitted within 15 days after the end of the anniversary month in which the administrative review is requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures and deadlines. If the Secretary defers the initiation of an administrative review, the Secretary will publish notice of the deferral in the Federal Register. The Secretary will initiate the administrative review in the month immediately following the next anniversary month, and the deadline for issuing preliminary results of review (see paragraph (h)(1) of this section) and submitting factual information (see Sec. 351.302(b)(2)) will run from the last day of the next anniversary month.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rescission of administrative review--(1) Withdrawal of request for review. The Secretary will rescind an administrative review under this section, in whole or in part, if a party that requested a review withdraws the request within 90 days of the date of publication of notice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides that it is reasonable to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Withdrawal of request for review. The Secretary will rescind an administrative review under this section, in whole or in part, if a party that requested a review withdraws the request within 90 days of the date of publication of notice of initiation of the requested review.

If the Secretary rescinds an administrative review (in whole or in part), the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Rescission of Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Administrative Review'' or, if appropriate, ``Partial Rescission of Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Administrative Review.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Period of review--(1) Antidumping proceedings.
