VA shall grant an  extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined  by Sec. 21.7050 of this part provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The veteran applies for an extension within the time specified  in Sec. 21.1033(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the  chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility  period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result  from the veteran's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the  disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful  misconduct. (See Sec. 21.7020(b)(38)) It must be clearly established by  medical evidence that such a program of education was medically  infeasible. VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period  of 30 days or less as having been prevented from initiating or  completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the  veteran was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen  program or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short  disability.
