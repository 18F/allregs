A  hearing will be held only in cases where issues of fact must be resolved  in order to determine whether the applicant or recipient has failed to  comply with one or more applicable requirements of title VI of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 (sec. 602, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1) and part 17 of this  title. However, this shall not prevent the parties from entering into a  stipulation of the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If all facts are stipulated, the proceedings shall go to  conclusion in accordance with part 17 of this title and the rules in  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In any case where it appears from the answer of the applicant or  recipient to the notice of hearing or notice of opportunity to request a  hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his admissions or  stipulations in the record that there are no matters of material fact in  dispute, the administrative law judge may enter an order so finding,  vacating the hearing date if one has been set, and fixing the time for  the submission of evidence by the Government for the record. Thereafter,  the proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with part 17 of  this title and the rules in this subpart. An appeal from such order may  be allowed in accordance with the rules for interlocutory appeal in  Sec. 4.823.</p>
