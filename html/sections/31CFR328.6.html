                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On bearer securities. The endorsement must be imprinted in the  lefthand portion of the face of each security with the first line  thereof parallel to the left edge of the security and in such manner as  to be clearly legible and in such position that it will not obscure the  serial number, series designation, or other identifying data, and cover  the smallest possible portion of the text on the face of the security.  The dimensions of the endorsement should be approximately 4 inches in  width and 1\1/2\ inches in height, and must be imprinted by stamp or  plate of such character as will render the endorsement substantially  ineradicable. The name of the Federal Reserve bank of the district must  appear on the plate or stamp used for the imprinting of the endorsement,  and presentation to the   appropriate branch of the Federal Reserve bank named will be considered  as presentation to the bank. When securities are to be presented to the  Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the words ``United States Treasury''  should be used in lieu of the words ``Federal Reserve Bank of ---------- ----, Fiscal Agent of the United States.'' No subsequent endorsement  will be recognized. If the form of endorsement on a security is  different than that prescribed in Sec. 328.5, the provisions of  Sec. Sec. 328.7 and 328.8 shall not apply to the security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On coupons. Unmatured coupons attached to restrictively endorsed  securities should be canceled by imprinting the prescribed endorsement  in such manner that a substantial portion of the endorsement will appear  on each such coupon. If any such coupons are missing, deduction of their  face amount will be made in cases of redemption, and in cases of  exchange, remittance equal to the face amount of the missing coupons  must accompany the securities. All matured coupons, including coupons  which will mature on or before the date of redemption or exchange  (except as otherwise specifically provided in an announcement of an  exchange offering), should be detached from securities upon which  restrictive endorsements are to be imprinted.</p>
