                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For contractors other than educational institutions and nonprofit organizations, the cognizant Federal agency normally will be the agency with the largest dollar amount of negotiated contracts, including options. For educational institutions and nonprofit organizations, the cognizant Federal agency is established according to Subsection G.11 of OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, and Attachment A, Subsection E.2, of OMB Circular A-122, Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once a Federal agency assumes cognizance for a contractor, it should remain cognizant for at least 5 years to ensure continuity and ease of administration. If, at the end of the 5-year period, another agency has the largest dollar amount of negotiated contracts, including options, the two agencies shall coordinate and determine which will assume cognizance. However, if circumstances warrant it and the affected agencies agree, cognizance may transfer prior to the expiration of the 5-year period.
