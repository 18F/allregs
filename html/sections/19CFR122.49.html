A correction in the manifest or air  waybill is not required if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The port director is satisfied that the difference between the  quantity of bulk merchandise listed on the manifest or air waybill, and  the quantity unladen, is the usual difference caused by absorption or  loss of moisture, temperature, faulty weighing at the airport, or other  such reason; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The marks or numbers on merchandise packages are different from  the marks or numbers listed on the cargo manifest for those packages if  the quantity and description of the merchandise is given correctly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Statutes applicable. If an aircraft arrives in the U.S. from a  foreign area with merchandise and unaccompanied baggage for which a  manifest or air waybill must be filed, section 584 (concerning manifest  violations), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1584, applies.  [T.D. 88-12, 53 FR 9292, Mar. 22, 1988, as amended by T.D. 98-74, 63 FR  51288, Sept. 25, 1998]    Sec. 122.49a  Electronic manifest requirement for passengers onboard  commercial aircraft arriving in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this section:</p><p class="depth0">Appropriate official. ``Appropriate official'' means the master or  commanding officer, or authorized agent, owner, or consignee, of a  commercial aircraft; this term and the term ``carrier'' are sometimes  used interchangeably.</p><p class="depth0">Carrier. See ``Appropriate official.''</p><p class="depth0">Commercial aircraft. ``Commercial aircraft'' has the meaning  provided in Sec. 122.1(d) and includes aircraft engaged in passenger  flight operations, all-cargo flight operations, and dual flight  operations involving the transport of both cargo and passengers.</p><p class="depth0">Crew Member. ``Crew member'' means a person serving on board an  aircraft in good faith in any capacity required for normal operation and  service of the flight. In addition, the definition of ``crew member''  applicable to this section should not be applied in the context of other  customs laws, to the extent this definition differs from the meaning of  ``crew member'' contemplated in such other customs laws.</p><p class="depth0">Departure. ``Departure'' means the point at which the wheels are up  on the aircraft and the aircraft is en route directly to its  destination.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency. ``Emergency'' means, with respect to an aircraft arriving  at a U.S. port due to an emergency, an urgent situation due to a  mechanical, medical, or security problem affecting the flight, or to an  urgent situation affecting the non-U.S. port of destination that  necessitates a detour to a U.S. port.</p><p class="depth0">Passenger. ``Passenger'' means any person, including a Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Security Inspector with valid  credentials and authorization, being transported on a commercial  aircraft who is not a crew member.</p><p class="depth0">Securing the aircraft. ``Securing the aircraft'' means the moment  the aircraft's doors are closed and secured for flight.</p><p class="depth0">United States. ``United States'' means the continental United  States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands (beginning November 28, 2009), and the Virgin  Islands of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)(ii)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em>, (B), (C), or (D) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> by means  of a   non-interactive electronic transmission system approved by CBP. The  carrier may make a single, complete batch manifest transmission  containing the data required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for  all passengers checked in for the flight or two or more partial batch  manifest transmissions, each containing the required data for the  identified passengers and which together cover all passengers checked in  for the flight. After receipt of the manifest information, the CBP  system will perform an initial security vetting of the data and send to  the carrier by a non-interactive transmission method a ``not-cleared''  instruction for passengers identified as requiring additional security  analysis and a ``selectee'' instruction for passengers requiring  secondary screening (e.g., additional examination of the person and/or  his baggage) under applicable Transportation Security Administration  (TSA) requirements. The carrier must designate as a ``selectee'' any  passenger so identified during initial security vetting, in accordance  with applicable TSA requirements. The carrier must not issue a boarding  pass to, or load the baggage of, any passenger subject to a ``not- cleared'' instruction and must contact TSA to seek resolution of the  ``not-cleared'' instruction by providing, if necessary, additional  relevant information relative to the ``not-cleared'' passenger. TSA will  notify the carrier if the ``not-cleared'' passenger is cleared for  boarding or downgraded to ``selectee'' status based on the additional  security analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interactive batch transmission option. A carrier, upon obtaining  CBP certification, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this  section, may make manifest transmissions by means of an interactive  electronic transmission system configured for batch transmission of data  and receipt from the CBP system of appropriate messages. A carrier  operating under this paragraph must make transmissions by transmitting a  single, complete batch manifest containing the data required under  paragraph (b)(3) of this section for all passengers checked in for the  flight or two or more partial batch manifests, each containing the  required data for the identified passengers and which together cover all  passengers checked in for the flight. In the case of connecting  passengers arriving at the connecting airport already in possession of  boarding passes for a U.S.-bound flight whose data have not been  collected by the carrier, the carrier must transmit all required  manifest data for these passengers when they arrive at the gate, or some  other suitable place designated by the carrier, for the flight. After  receipt of the manifest information, the CBP system will perform an  initial security vetting of the data and send to the carrier by  interactive electronic transmission, as appropriate, a ``cleared''  instruction for passengers not matching against the watch list, a ``not- cleared'' instruction for passengers identified as requiring additional  security analysis, and a ``selectee'' instruction for passengers who  require secondary screening (e.g., additional examination of the person  and/or his baggage) under applicable TSA requirements. The carrier must  designate as a ``selectee'' any passenger so identified during initial  security vetting, in accordance with applicable TSA requirements. The  carrier must not issue a boarding pass to, or load the baggage of, any  passenger subject to a ``not-cleared'' instruction and, in the case of  connecting passengers (as described in this paragraph), the carrier must  not board or load the baggage of any such passenger until the CBP system  returns a ``cleared'' or ``selectee'' response for that passenger. Where  a ``selectee'' instruction is received for a connecting passenger, the  carrier must ensure that such passenger undergoes secondary screening  before boarding. The carrier must seek resolution of a ``not-cleared''  instruction by contacting TSA and providing, if necessary, additional  relevant information relative to the ``not-cleared'' passenger. Upon  completion of the additional security analysis, TSA will notify the  carrier if a ``not-cleared'' passenger is cleared for boarding or  downgraded to ``selectee'' status based on the additional security  analysis. No later than 30 minutes after the securing of the aircraft,  the carrier must transmit to the CBP system a message reporting any  passengers who checked in but were not   onboard the flight. The message must identify the passengers by a unique  identifier selected or devised by the carrier or by specific passenger  data (e.g., name) and may contain the unique identifiers or data for all  passengers onboard the flight or for only those passengers who checked  in but were not onboard the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interactive individual passenger information transmission  option. A carrier, upon obtaining CBP certification, in accordance with  paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section, may make manifest transmissions  by means of an interactive electronic transmission system configured for  transmitting individual passenger data for each passenger and for  receiving from the CBP system appropriate messages. A carrier operating  under this paragraph must make such transmissions as individual  passengers check in for the flight or, in the case of connecting  passengers arriving at the connecting airport already in possession of  boarding passes for a U.S.-bound flight whose data have not been  collected by the carrier, as these connecting passengers arrive at the  gate, or some other suitable place designated by the carrier, for the  flight. With each transmission of manifest information by the carrier,  the CBP system will perform an initial security vetting of the data and  send to the carrier by interactive electronic transmission, as  appropriate, a ``cleared'' instruction for passengers not matching  against the watch list, a ``not-cleared'' instruction for passengers  identified as requiring additional security analysis, and a ``selectee''  instruction for passengers requiring secondary screening (e.g.,  additional examination of the person and/or his baggage) under  applicable TSA requirements. The carrier must designate as a  ``selectee'' any passenger so identified during initial security  vetting, in accordance with applicable TSA requirements. The carrier  must not issue a boarding pass to, or load the baggage of, any passenger  subject to a ``not-cleared'' instruction and, in the case of connecting  passengers (as described in this paragraph), must not board or load the  baggage of any such passenger until the CBP system returns a ``cleared''  or ``selectee'' response for that passenger. Where a ``selectee''  instruction is received by the carrier for a connecting passenger, the  carrier must ensure that secondary screening of the passenger is  conducted before boarding. The carrier must seek resolution of a ``not- cleared'' instruction by contacting TSA and providing, if necessary,  additional relevant information relative to the ``not-cleared''  passenger. Upon completion of the additional security analysis, TSA will  notify the carrier if a ``not-cleared'' passenger is cleared for  boarding or downgraded to ``selectee'' status based on the additional  security analysis. No later than 30 minutes after the securing of the  aircraft, the carrier must transmit to the CBP system a message  reporting any passengers who checked in but were not onboard the flight.  The message must identify the passengers by a unique identifier selected  or devised by the carrier or by specific passenger data (name) and may  contain the unique identifiers or data for all passengers onboard the  flight or for only those passengers who checked in but were not onboard  the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Combined use of interactive methods. If certified to do so, a  carrier may make transmissions under both paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(B) and  (C) of this section for a particular flight or for different flights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Certification. Before making any required manifest transmissions  under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, a carrier must  subject its electronic transmission system to CBP testing, and CBP must  certify that the carrier's system is then presently capable of  interactively communicating with the CBP system for effective  transmission of manifest data and receipt of appropriate messages in  accordance with those paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Place and time for submission. The appropriate official  specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (carrier) must transmit  the arrival manifest or manifest data as required under paragraphs  (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section to the CBP system (CBP Data Center,  CBP Headquarters), in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For manifests transmitted under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) or (B)  of this section, no later than 30 minutes prior to the securing of the  aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(C)</em> of this section, no later than the securing of the  aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For flights not originally destined to the United States but  diverted to a U.S. port due to an emergency, no later than 30 minutes  prior to arrival; in cases of non-compliance, CBP will take into  consideration whether the carrier was equipped to make the transmission  and the circumstances of the emergency situation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For an aircraft operating as an air ambulance in service of a  medical emergency, no later than 30 minutes prior to arrival; in cases  of non-compliance, CBP will take into consideration whether the carrier  was equipped to make the transmission and the circumstances of the  emergency situation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information required. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of  this section, the electronic passenger arrival manifest required under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section must contain the following information  for all passengers, except that the information specified in paragraphs  (b)(iv), (v), (x), (xii), (xiii), and (xiv) of this section must be  included on the manifest only on or after October 4, 2005:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Full name (last, first, and, if available, middle);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date of birth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gender (F = female; M = male);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Citizenship;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Country of residence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Status on board the aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Travel document type (e.g., P = passport; A = alien  registration card);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Passport number, if a passport is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Passport country of issuance, if a passport is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Passport expiration date, if a passport is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Alien registration number, where applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Address while in the United States (number and street, city,  state, and zip code), except that this information is not required for  U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or persons who are in transit  to a location outside the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Passenger Name Record locator, if available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> International Air Transport Association (IATA) code of foreign  port/place where transportation to the United States began (foreign port  code);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> IATA code of port/place of first arrival (arrival port code);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> IATA code of final foreign port/place of destination for in- transit passengers (foreign port code);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvii)</em> Airline carrier code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xviii)</em> Flight number; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xix)</em> Date of aircraft arrival.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exception. The electronic passenger arrival manifest specified  in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not required for active duty U.S.  military personnel being transported as passengers on arriving  Department of Defense commercial chartered aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Carrier responsibility for comparing information collected with  travel document. The carrier collecting the information described in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section is responsible for comparing the travel  document presented by the passenger with the travel document information  it is transmitting to CBP in accordance with this section in order to  ensure that the information is correct, the document appears to be valid  for travel to the United States, and the passenger is the person to whom  the travel document was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sharing of manifest information. Information contained in the  passenger manifests required by this section that is received by CBP  electronically may, upon request, be shared with other Federal agencies  for the purpose of protecting national security. CBP may also share such  information as otherwise authorized by law.  [CBP Dec. 05-12, 70 FR 17852, Apr. 7, 2005, as amended by CBP Dec. 07- 64, 72 FR 48342, Aug. 23, 2007; CBP Dec. 09-02, 74 FR 2836, Jan. 16,  2009; CBP Dec. 09-14, 74 FR 25388, May 28, 2009]    Sec. 122.49b  Electronic manifest requirement for crew members and non -crew members onboard commercial aircraft arriving in, continuing within, and overflying he United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, other  than those for the   terms set forth below, also apply for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0">All-cargo flight. ``All-cargo flight'' means a flight in operation  for the purpose of transporting cargo which has onboard only ``crew  members'' and ``non-crew members'' as defined in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Carrier. In addition to the meaning set forth in Sec. 122.49a(a),  ``carrier'' includes each entity that is an ``aircraft operator'' or  ``foreign air carrier'' with a security program under 49 CFR part 1544,  1546, or 1550 of the Transportation Security Administration regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Crew member. ``Crew member'' means a pilot, copilot, flight  engineer, airline management personnel authorized to travel in the  cockpit, cabin crew, and relief crew (also known as ``deadheading  crew''). However, for all other purposes of immigration law and  documentary evidence required under the Immigration and Nationality Act  (8 U.S.C. 1101, et seq.), ``crew member'' (or ``crewman'') means a  person serving onboard an aircraft in good faith in any capacity  required for the normal operation and service of the flight (8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(10) and (a)(15)(D), as applicable). In addition, the definition  of ``crew member'' applicable to this section should not be applied in  the context of other customs laws, to the extent this definition differs  from the meaning of ``crew member'' contemplated in such other customs  laws.</p><p class="depth0">Flight continuing within the United States. ``Flight continuing  within the United States'' refers to the domestic leg of a flight  operated by a foreign air carrier that originates at a foreign port or  place, arrives at a U.S. port, and then continues to a second U.S. port.</p><p class="depth0">Flight overflying the United States. ``Flight overflying the United  States'' refers to a flight departing from a foreign port or place that  enters the territorial airspace of the U.S. en route to another foreign  port or place.</p><p class="depth0">Non-crew member. ``Non-crew member'' means air carrier employees and  their family members and persons traveling onboard a commercial aircraft  for the safety of the flight (such as an animal handler when animals are  onboard). The definition of ``non-crew member'' is limited to all-cargo  flights. (On a passenger or dual flight (passengers and cargo), air  carrier employees, their family members, and persons onboard for the  safety of the flight are considered passengers.)</p><p class="depth0">Territorial airspace of the United States. ``Territorial airspace of  the United States'' means the airspace over the United States, its  territories, and possessions, and the airspace over the territorial  waters between the United States coast and 12 nautical miles from the  coast.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Electronic arrival manifest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirement.

After  being contacted by Customs, if an air carrier determines it needs more  than 30 days to properly interface its automated database with the  Customs Data Center, it may apply in writing to the Assistant  Commissioner, Office of Field Operations (OFO) for an extension.  Following receipt of the application, the Assistant Commissioner, OFO,  may, in writing, allow the carrier an extension of this period for good  cause shown. The Assistant Commissioner's decision as to whether and/or  to what extent to grant such an extension is within the sole discretion  of the Assistant Commissioner and is final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sharing of PNR information with other Federal agencies.
