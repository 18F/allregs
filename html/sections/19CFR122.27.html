A foreign landing certificate or certified copy of a foreign Customs entry is required as proof of exportation if the cargo includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Merchandise valued at more than $500.00; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> More than one case of alcoholic beverages withdrawn from a Customs bonded warehouse or otherwise in bond for direct exportation by private aircraft.
A foreign landing certificate, when required, shall be produced within six months from the date of exportation and shall be signed by a revenue officer of the foreign country to which the merchandise is exported, unless it is shown that the country has no Customs administration, in which case the certificate may be signed by the consignee or by the vessel's agent at the place of landing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pilot certificate/license, certificate of registration--(1) Pilot certificate/license.
