(1) Except as the Commission may otherwise authorize, no person may have access to Safeguards Information unless the person has an established ``need to know'' for the information and has undergone a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal history records check using the procedures set forth in Sec. 73.57.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition, a person to be granted access to Safeguards Information must be trustworthy and reliable, based on a background check or other means approved by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The categories of individuals specified in 10 CFR 73.59 are exempt from the criminal history records check and background check requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section by virtue of their occupational status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For persons participating in an NRC adjudicatory proceeding, the

``need to know'' determination shall be made by the originator of the Safeguards Information upon receipt of a request for access to the Safeguards Information. Where the information is in the possession of the originator and the NRC staff, whether in its original form or incorporated into another document or other matter by the recipient, the NRC staff shall make the determination. In the event of a dispute regarding the ``need to know'' determination, the presiding officer of the proceeding shall determine whether the ``need to know'' findings in Sec. 73.2 can be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Except as the Commission may otherwise authorize, no person may disclose Safeguards Information to any other person except as set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Protection while in use or storage. (1) While in use, matter containing Safeguards Information must be under the control of an individual authorized access to Safeguards Information. This requirement is satisfied if the Safeguards Information is attended by such an individual even though the information is in fact not constantly being used. Safeguards Information within alarm stations, or rooms continuously occupied by authorized individuals need not be stored in a locked security storage container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> While unattended, Safeguards Information must be stored in a locked security storage container. The container shall not identify the contents of the matter contained and must preclude access by individuals not authorized access in accordance with the provisions of this section. Knowledge of lock combinations protecting Safeguards Information must be limited to a minimum number of personnel for operating purposes who have a ``need to know'' and are otherwise authorized access to Safeguards Information in accordance with the provisions of this Part. Access to lock combinations must be strictly controlled so as to prevent disclosure to an individual not authorized access to Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Preparation and marking of documents or other matter. (1) Each document or other matter that contains Safeguards Information as described in Sec. 73.21(a)(1)(i) and this section must be marked to indicate the presence of such information in a conspicuous manner on the top and bottom of each page. The first page of the document or other matter must also contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, title, and organization of the individual authorized to make a Safeguards Information determination, and who has determined that the document or other matter contains Safeguards Information;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date the determination was made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An indication that unauthorized disclosure will be subject to civil and criminal sanctions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the markings at the top and bottom of each page, any transmittal letters or memoranda to or from the NRC which do not in themselves contain Safeguards Information shall be marked to indicate that attachments or enclosures contain Safeguards Information but that the transmittal document or other matter does not (i.e., ``When separated from Safeguards Information enclosure(s), this document is decontrolled provided the transmittal document does not otherwise warrant protection from unauthorized disclosure'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any transmittal document or other matter forwarding Safeguards Information must alert the recipient that protected information is enclosed. Certification that a document or other matter contains Safeguards Information must include the name and title of the certifying official and date designated. Portion marking is required only for correspondence to and from the NRC (i.e., cover letters, but not attachments) that contains Safeguards Information. The portion marking must be sufficient to allow the recipient to identify and distinguish those sections of the transmittal document or other information containing the Safeguards Information from non-Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Marking of documents or other matter containing or transmitting Safeguards Information shall, at a minimum include the words ``Safeguards Information'' to ensure identification of protected information for the protection of facilities and material covered by Sec. 73.22.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reproduction of matter containing Safeguards Information. Safeguards Information may be reproduced to the minimum extent necessary consistent with need without permission of the originator. Equipment used to reproduce Safeguards Information must be evaluated to ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot access Safeguards Information (e.g., unauthorized individuals cannot access Safeguards Information by gaining access to retained memory or network connectivity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> External transmission of documents and material. (1) Documents or other matter containing Safeguards Information, when transmitted outside an authorized place of use or storage, must be packaged in two sealed envelopes or wrappers to preclude disclosure of the presence of protected information. The inner envelope or wrapper must contain the name and address of the intended recipient and be marked on both sides, top and bottom, with the words ``Safeguards Information.'' The outer envelope or wrapper must be opaque, addressed to the intended recipient, must contain the address of the sender, and may not bear any markings or indication that the document or other matter contains Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safeguards Information may be transported by any commercial delivery company that provides service with computer tracking features, U.S. first class, registered, express, or certified mail, or by any individual authorized access pursuant to these requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except under emergency or extraordinary conditions, Safeguards Information shall be transmitted outside an authorized place of use or storage only by NRC approved secure electronic devices, such as facsimiles or telephone devices, provided that transmitters and receivers implement processes that will provide high assurance that Safeguards Information is protected before and after the transmission or electronic mail through the internet, provided that the information is encrypted by a method (Federal Information Processing Standard [FIPS] 140-2 or later) approved by the appropriate NRC Office; the information is produced by a self contained secure automatic data process system; and transmitters and receivers implement the information handling processes that will provide high assurance that Safeguards Information is protected before and after transmission. Physical security events required to be reported pursuant to Sec. 73.71 are considered to be extraordinary conditions. Cyber security event notifications required to be reported pursuant to Sec. 73.77 are considered to be extraordinary conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Processing of Safeguards Information on electronic systems. (1) Safeguards Information may be stored, processed or produced on a stand-alone computer (or computer system) for processing of Safeguards Information. ``Stand-alone'' means a computer or computer system to which access is limited to individuals authorized access to Safeguards Information. A stand-alone computer or computer system shall not be physically or in any other way connected to a network accessible by users who are not authorized access to Safeguards Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each computer not located within an approved and lockable security storage container that is used to process Safeguards Information must have a removable storage medium with a bootable operating system. The bootable operating system must be used to load and initialize the computer. The removable storage medium must also contain the software application programs. Data may be saved on either the removable storage medium that is used to boot the operating system, or on a different removable storage medium. The removable storage medium must be secured in a locked security storage container when not in use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A mobile device (such as a laptop computer) may also be used for the processing of Safeguards Information provided the device is secured in a locked security storage container when not in use. Other systems may be used if approved for security by the appropriate NRC office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any electronic system that has been used for storage, processing or production of Safeguards Information must be free of recoverable Safeguards Information prior to being returned to nonexclusive use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Removal from Safeguards Information category. Documents or other matter originally containing Safeguards Information must be removed from the Safeguards Information category at such time as the information no longer meets the criteria contained in this part. Care must be exercised to ensure that any document or other matter decontrolled not disclose Safeguards Information in some other form or be combined with other unprotected information to disclose Safeguards Information. The authority to determine that a document or other matter may be decontrolled will only be exercised by the NRC, with NRC approval, or in consultation with the individual or organization that made the original determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Destruction of matter containing Safeguards Information. Documents or other matter containing Safeguards Information shall be destroyed when no longer needed. The information can be destroyed by burning, shredding or any other method that precludes reconstruction by means available to the public at large. Piece sizes no wider than one quarter inch composed of several pages or documents and thoroughly mixed are considered completely destroyed.
