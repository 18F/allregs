                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Automatic data collection equipment requirements. The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, and so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the following is required:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For bag sample analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the dilute exhaust sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period shall be stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For continuous analysis systems, a single value representing the average integrated concentration over a cycle shall be stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be stored on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage discs, punch cards, and so forth, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC equipment is subject to the calibration specifications of the analyzer as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be stored as chart recorder records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Bag sample analysis. For bag sample analysis perform the following sequence:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and so forth, as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Obtain a stable zero reading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Zero and span the analyzers with zero and span gases. The span gases must have concentrations between 75 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. The flow rates and system

pressures during spanning shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. A sample bag may be used to identify the required analyzer range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Recheck zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (c)(3) of this section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section must be repeated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Measure HC, CO, CO2, and NOX background concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (Constituents measured continuously do not require bag analysis.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A post-analysis zero and span check of each range must be performed and the values recorded. The number of events that may occur between the pre- and post-analysis checks is not specified. However, the difference between pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in paragraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this section) versus those recorded for the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span drift limit of 2 percent of full-scale chart deflection for any range used. Otherwise the test is void.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Continuous sample analysis. For continuous sample analysis perform the following sequence:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Warm up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), and so forth, as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated sample lines, filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Optional: Perform a hangup check for the HFID sampling system:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Zero the analyzer using zero air introduced at the analyzer port.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Flow zero air through the overflow sampling system. Check the analyzer response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the overflow zero response exceeds the analyzer zero response by 2 percent or more of the HFID full-scale deflection, hangup is indicated and corrective action must be taken.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The complete system hangup check specified in paragraph (e) of this section is recommended as a periodic check.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Obtain a stable zero reading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Zero and span each range to be used on each analyzer operated prior to the beginning of the test cycle. The span gases shall have a concentration between 75 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. The HFID analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned either through the overflow sampling system or through the analyzer port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (d)(5) of this section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5), and (d)(6) of this section must be repeated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Collect background HC, CO, CO2, and NOX in a sample bag (for dilute exhaust sampling only, see Sec. 89.420).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Perform a post-analysis zero and span check for each range used at the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Record these responses as the post-analysis values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Neither the zero drift nor the span drift between the pre-analysis and post-analysis checks on any range used may exceed 3 percent for HC, or 2 percent for NOX. CO, and CO2, of full scale chart deflection, or the test is void. (If the HC drift is greater than 3 percent of full-scale chart deflection, hydrocarbon hangup is likely.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Determine background levels of NOX. CO, or CO2 (for dilute exhaust

sampling only) by the bag sample technique outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Hydrocarbon hangup. If HC hangup is indicated, the following sequence may be performed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fill a clean sample bag with background air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero and span the HFID at the analyzer ports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Analyze the background air sample bag through the analyzer ports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Analyze the background air through the entire sample probe system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the difference between the readings obtained greater than or equal to 2 percent of full scale deflection, clean the sample probe and the sample line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reassemble the sample system, heat to specified temperature, and repeat the procedure in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section.
