                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A grantee must give prompt, fair and adequate consideration to  applications submitted by current or prospective delegate agencies to  operate Head Start programs. The failure of the grantee to act within 30  days after receiving the application is deemed to be a rejection of the  application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A grantee must notify an applicant in writing within 30 days  after receiving the application of its decision to either accept or to  wholly or substantially reject it. If the decision is to wholly or  substantially reject the application, the notice shall contain a  statement of the reasons for the decision and a statement that the  applicant has a right to appeal the decision within ten work days after  receipt of the notice. If a grantee fails to act on the application by  the end of the 30 day period which grantees have to review applications,  the current or prospective delegate agency may appeal to the grantee, in  writing, within 15 work days of the end of the 30 day grantee review  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A grantee must notify a delegate agency in writing of its  decision to terminate its agreement with the delegate agency, explaining  the reasons for its decision and that the delegate agency has the right  to appeal the decision to the grantee within ten work days after receipt  of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The grantee has 20 days to review the written appeal and issue  its decision. If the grantee sustains its earlier termination of an  award or its rejection of an application, the current or prospective  delegate agency then may appeal, in writing, to the responsible HHS  official. The appeal must be submitted to the responsible HHS official  within ten work days after the receipt of the grantee's final decision.  The appeal must fully set forth the grounds for the appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A grantee may not reject the application or terminate the  operations of a delegate agency on the basis of defects or deficiencies  in the application or in the operation of the program without first:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notifying the delegate agency of the defects and deficiencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing, or providing for, technical assistance so that  defects and deficiencies can be corrected by the delegate agency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Giving the delegate agency the opportunity to make appropriate  corrections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An appeal filed pursuant to a grantee failing to act on a  current or prospective delegate agency's application within a 30 day  period need only contain a copy of the application, the date filed, and  any proof of the date the grantee received the application.
