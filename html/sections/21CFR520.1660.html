The drug can be used for continuation of compatible antibiotic therapy following parenteral oxytetracycline administration where rapidly attained, sustained antibiotic blood levels are required. The duration of treatment required to obtain favorable response will depend to some extent on the severity and degree of involvement and the susceptibility of the infectious agent. Clinical response to antibiotic therapy usually occurs within 48 to 72 hours. If improvement is not observed within that period, the diagnosis and course of treatment should be reconsidered. To assure adequate treatment, administration of the drug should continue for at least 48 hours following favorable clinical response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.
