                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) An OTP must be the subject of a current, valid  certification from SAMHSA to be considered qualified by the Secretary  under section 303(g)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.  823(g)(1)) to dispense opioid drugs in the treatment of opioid  addiction. An OTP must be determined to be qualified under section  303(g)(1) of the Controlled Substances Act, and must be determined to be  qualified by the Attorney General under section 303(g)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, to be  registered by the Attorney General to dispense opioid agonist treatment  medications to individuals for treatment of opioid addiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To obtain certification from SAMHSA, an OTP must meet the  Federal opioid treatment standards in Sec.  8.12, must be the subject of  a current, valid accreditation by an accreditation body or other entity  designated by SAMHSA, and must comply with any other conditions for  certification established by SAMHSA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification shall be granted for a term not to exceed 3 years,  except that certification may be extended during the third year if an  application for accreditation is pending.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. SAMHSA will consider and accept the electronic  submission of these materials when electronic submission systems are  developed and available. The application for certification shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the current accreditation status of the OTP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the organizational structure of the OTP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The names of the persons responsible for the OTP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The addresses of the OTP and of each medication unit or other  facility under the control of the OTP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The sources of funding for the OTP and the name and address of  each governmental entity that provides such funding; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A statement that the OTP will comply with the conditions of  certification set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The application shall be signed by the program sponsor who shall  certify that the information submitted in the application is truthful  and accurate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Action on application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following SAMHSA's receipt of an  application for certification of an OTP, and after consultation with the  appropriate State authority regarding the qualifications of the  applicant, SAMHSA may grant the application for certification, or renew  an existing certification, if SAMHSA determines that the OTP has  satisfied the requirements for certification or renewal of  certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> SAMHSA may deny the application if SAMHSA determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The application for certification is deficient in any respect;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The OTP will not be operated in accordance with the Federal  opioid treatment standards established under Sec.  8.12;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The OTP will not permit an inspection or a survey to proceed,  or will not permit in a timely manner access to relevant records or  information; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The OTP has made misrepresentations in obtaining accreditation  or in applying for certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 5 days after it reaches a final determination that an OTP  meets the requirements for certification, SAMHSA will notify the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) that the OTP has been determined to be  qualified to provide opioid treatment under section 303(g)(1) of the  Controlled Substances Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transitional certification. OTPs that before May 18, 2001 were  the subject of a current, valid approval by FDA under 21 CFR, part 291  (contained in the 21 CFR parts 200 to 299 edition, revised as of July 1,  2000), are deemed to be the subject of a current valid certification for  purposes of paragraph (a)(11) of this section. Such ``transitional  certification'' will expire on August 17, 2001 unless the OTP submits  the information required by paragraph (b) of this section to SAMHSA on  or before August 17, 2001. In addition to this application, OTPs must  certify with a   written statement signed by the program sponsor, that they will apply  for accreditation within 90 days of the date SAMHSA approves the second  accreditation body. Transitional certification, in that case, will  expire on May 19, 2003. SAMHSA may extend the transitional certification  of an OTP for up to one additional year provided the OTP demonstrates  that it has applied for accreditation, that an accreditation survey has  taken place or is scheduled to take place, and that an accreditation  decision is expected within a reasonable period of time (e.g., within 90  days from the date of survey). Transitional certification under this  section may be suspended or revoked in accordance with Sec.  8.14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Provisional certification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OTPs that have no current  certification from SAMHSA, but have applied for accreditation with an  accreditation body, are eligible to receive a provisional certification  for up to 1 year. To receive a provisional certification, an OTP shall  submit the information required by paragraph (b) of this section to  SAMHSA along with a statement identifying the accreditation body to  which the OTP has applied for accreditation, the date on which the OTP  applied for accreditation, the dates of any accreditation surveys that  have taken place or are expected to take place, and the expected  schedule for completing the accreditation process. A provisional  certification for up to 1 year will be granted, following receipt of the  information described in this paragraph, unless SAMHSA determines that  patient health would be adversely affected by the granting of  provisional certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An extension of provisional certification may be granted in  extraordinary circumstances or otherwise to protect public health. To  apply for a 90-day extension of provisional certification, an OTP shall  submit to SAMHSA a statement explaining its efforts to obtain  accreditation and a schedule for obtaining accreditation as  expeditiously as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Conditions for certification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OTPs shall comply with all  pertinent State laws and regulations. Nothing in this part is intended  to limit the authority of State and, as appropriate, local governmental  entities to regulate the use of opioid drugs in the treatment of opioid  addiction. The provisions of this section requiring compliance with  requirements imposed by State law, or the submission of applications or  reports required by the State authority, do not apply to OTPs operated  directly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Indian Health  Service, or any other department or agency of the United States. Federal  agencies operating OTPs have agreed to cooperate voluntarily with State  agencies by granting permission on an informal basis for designated  State representatives to visit Federal OTPs and by furnishing a copy of  Federal reports to the State authority, including the reports required  under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OTPs shall allow, in accordance with Federal controlled  substances laws and Federal confidentiality laws, inspections and  surveys by duly authorized employees of SAMHSA, by accreditation bodies,  by the DEA, and by authorized employees of any relevant State or Federal  governmental authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of patient records maintained by an OTP is governed  by the provisions of 42 CFR part 2, and every program must comply with  that part. Records on the receipt, storage, and distribution of opioid  agonist treatment medications are also subject to inspection under  Federal controlled substances laws and under the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.). Federally-sponsored treatment  programs are subject to applicable Federal confidentiality statutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A treatment program or medication unit or any part thereof,  including any facility or any individual, shall permit a duly authorized  employee of SAMHSA to have access to and to copy all records on the use  of opioid drugs in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR part 2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> OTPs shall notify SAMHSA within 3 weeks of any replacement or  other change in the status of the program sponsor or medical director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> OTPs shall comply with all regulations enforced by the DEA under  21 CFR chapter II, and must be registered by the DEA before  administering or   dispensing opioid agonist treatment medications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> OTPs must operate in accordance with Federal opioid treatment  standards and approved accreditation elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Conditions for interim maintenance treatment program approval.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before a public or nonprofit private OTP may provide interim  maintenance treatment, the program must receive the approval of both  SAMHSA and the chief public health officer of the State in which the OTP  operates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before SAMHSA may grant such approval, the OTP must provide  SAMHSA with documentation from the chief public health officer of the  State in which the OTP operates demonstrating that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such officer does not object to the providing of interim  maintenance treatment in the State;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The OTP seeking to provide such treatment is unable to place  patients in a public or nonprofit private comprehensive treatment  program within a reasonable geographic area within 14 days of the time  patients seek admission to such programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The authorization of the OTP to provide interim maintenance  treatment will not otherwise reduce the capacity of comprehensive  maintenance treatment programs in the State to admit individuals  (relative to the date on which such officer so certifies); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The State certifies that each individual enrolled in interim  maintenance treatment will be transferred to a comprehensive maintenance  treatment program no later than 120 days from the date on which each  individual first requested treatment, as provided in section 1923 of the  Public Health Service Act (21 U.S.C. 300x-23).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SAMHSA will provide notice to the OTP denying or approving the  request to provide interim maintenance treatment. The OTP shall not  provide such treatment until it has received such notice from SAMHSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exemptions. An OTP may, at the time of application for  certification or any time thereafter, request from SAMHSA exemption from  the regulatory requirements set forth under this section and Sec.  8.12.  An example of a case in which an exemption might be granted would be for  a private practitioner who wishes to treat a limited number of patients  in a non-metropolitan area with few physicians and no rehabilitative  services geographically accessible and requests exemption from some of  the staffing and service standards. The OTP shall support the rationale  for the exemption with thorough documentation, to be supplied in an  appendix to the initial application for certification or in a separate  submission. SAMHSA will approve or deny such exemptions at the time of  application, or any time thereafter, if appropriate. SAMHSA shall  consult with the appropriate State authority prior to taking action on  an exemption request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Medication units, long-term care facilities and hospitals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Certified OTPs may establish medication units that are authorized to  dispense opioid agonist treatment medications for observed ingestion.  Before establishing a medication unit, a certified OTP must notify  SAMHSA by submitting form SMA-162. The OTP must also comply with the  provisions of 21 CFR part 1300 before establishing a medication unit.  Medication units shall comply with all pertinent state laws and  regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certification as an OTP under this part will not be required for  the maintenance or detoxification treatment of a patient who is admitted  to a hospital or long-term care facility for the treatment of medical  conditions other than opiate addiction and who requires maintenance or  detoxification treatment during the period of his or her stay in that  hospital or long-term care facility. The terms ``hospital'' and ``long- term care facility'' as used in this section are to have the meaning  that is assigned under the law of the State in which the treatment is  being provided. Nothing in this section is intended to relieve hospitals  and long-term care facilities from the obligation to obtain registration  from the Attorney General, as appropriate, under section 303(g) of the  Controlled Substances Act.
