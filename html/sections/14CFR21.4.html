The holder of a type certificate for an airplane-engine combination approved using the Early ETOPS method specified in part 25, Appendix K, of this chapter must use a system for reporting, tracking, and resolving each problem resulting in one of the occurrences specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The system must identify how the type certificate holder will promptly identify problems, report them to the responsible FAA aircraft certification office, and propose a solution to the

FAA to resolve each problem. A proposed solution must consist of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A change in the airplane or engine type design;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A change in a manufacturing process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A change in an operating or maintenance procedure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any other solution acceptable to the FAA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For an airplane with more than two engines, the system must be in place for the first 250,000 world fleet engine-hours for the approved airplane-engine combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For two-engine airplanes, the system must be in place for the first 250,000 world fleet engine-hours for the approved airplane-engine combination and after that until--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rate is at or below the rate required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The FAA determines that the rate is stable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For an airplane-engine combination that is a derivative of an airplane-engine combination previously approved for ETOPS, the system need only address those problems specified in the following table, provided the type certificate holder obtains prior authorization from the FAA:

The holder of a type certificate for an airplane approved for ETOPS and the holder of a type certificate for an engine installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS must report monthly to their respective FAA type certificate holding office on the reliability of the world fleet of those airplanes and engines. The report provided by both the airplane and engine type certificate holders must address each airplane-engine combination approved for ETOPS. The FAA may approve quarterly reporting if the airplane-engine combination demonstrates an IFSD rate at or below those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a period acceptable to the FAA. This reporting may be combined with the reporting required by Sec. 21.3. The responsible type certificate holder must investigate any cause of an IFSD resulting from an occurrence

attributable to the design of its product and report the results of that investigation to its FAA office responsible for administering its type certificate.
