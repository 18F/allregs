                                Sec. 40.149  May the MRO change a verified drug test result?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As the MRO, you may change a verified test result only in the  following situations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When you have reopened a verification that was done without an  interview with an employee (see Sec. 40.133(d)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you receive information, not available to you at the time of  the original verification, demonstrating that the laboratory made an  error in identifying (e.g., a paperwork mistake) or testing (e.g., a  false positive or negative) the employee's primary or split specimen.  For example, suppose the laboratory originally reported a positive test  result for Employee X and a negative result for Employee Y. You   verified the test results as reported to you. Then the laboratory  notifies you that it mixed up the two test results, and X was really  negative and Y was really positive. You would change X's test result  from positive to negative and contact Y to conduct a verification  interview.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, within 60 days of the original verification decision--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You receive information that could not reasonably have been  provided to you at the time of the decision demonstrating that there is  a legitimate medical explanation for the presence of drug(s)/ metabolite(s) in the employee's specimen; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You receive credible new or additional evidence that a  legitimate medical explanation for an adulterated or substituted result  exists.</p><p class="depth4">Example to paragraph (a)(3): If the employee's physician provides  you a valid prescription that he or she failed to find at the time of  the original verification, you may change the test result from positive  to negative if you conclude that the prescription provides a legitimate  medical explanation for the drug(s)/ metabolite(s) in the employee's  specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you receive the information in paragraph (a)(3) of this  section after the 60-day period, you must consult with ODAPC prior to  changing the result.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When you have made an administrative error and reported an  incorrect result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you change the result, you must immediately notify the DER in  writing, as provided in Sec. Sec. 40.163-40.165.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You are the only person permitted to change a verified test  result, such as a verified positive test result or a determination that  an individual has refused to test because of adulteration or  substitution. This is because, as the MRO, you have the sole authority  under this part to make medical determinations leading to a verified  test (e.g., a determination that there was or was not a legitimate  medical explanation for a laboratory test result). For example, an  arbitrator is not permitted to overturn the medical judgment of the MRO  that the employee failed to present a legitimate medical explanation for  a positive, adulterated, or substituted test result of his or her  specimen.
