                            <p class="depth0">Before accepting the space, the contracting officer must verify that the space complies with the Government's requirements and specifications and document this in an inspection report. The inspection and acceptance document must contain the square footage accepted and the acceptance date. Include the inspection and acceptance in the contract file. When space such as piers, antennas, and parking are leased, square footage may not be the manner in which the amount of space is specified; therefore, document that the space complies with the Government's written requirements.
