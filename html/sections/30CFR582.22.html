The Delineation Plan shall describe the proposed activities necessary to  locate leased OCS minerals, characterize the quantity and quality of the  minerals, and generate other information needed for the development of a  comprehensive Testing or Mining Plan. A Delineation Plan at a minimum  shall include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The OCS mineral(s) or primary interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A brief narrative description of the activities to be conducted  and how the activities will lead to the discovery and evaluation of a  commercially minable deposit on the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The name, registration, and type of equipment to be used,  including vessel types as well as their navigation and mobile  communication systems, and transportation corridors to be used between  the lease and shore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information showing that the equipment to be used (including the  vessel) is capable of performing the intended operation in the  environment which will be encountered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Maps showing the proposed locations of test drill holes, the  anticipated depth of penetration of test drill holes, the locations  where surficial samples were taken, and the location of proposed  geophysical survey lines for each surveying method being employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A description of measures to be taken to avoid, minimize, or  otherwise mitigate air, land, and water pollution and damage to aquatic  and wildlife species and their habitats; any unique or special features  in the lease area; aquifers; other natural resources of the OCS; and  hazards to public health, safety, and navigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A schedule indicating the starting and completion dates for each  proposed exploration activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A list of any known archaeological resources on the lease and   measures to assure that the proposed exploration activities do not  damage those resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> A description of any potential conflicts with other uses and  users of the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A description of measures to be taken to monitor the effects of  the proposed exploration activities on the environment in accordance  with Sec.  582.28(c) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A detailed description of practices and procedures to effect the  abandonment of exploration activities, e.g., plugging of test drill  holes.
