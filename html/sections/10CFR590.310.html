                            <p class="depth0">Any party may file a motion requesting additional procedures,  including the opportunity to file written comments, request written  interrogatories or other discovery procedures, or request that a  conference, oral presentation or trial-type hearing be held. The motion  shall describe what type of procedure is requested and include the  information required by Secs. 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313, as  appropriate. Failure to request additional procedures within the time  specified in the notice of application or in the notice of procedure, if  applicable, shall constitute a waiver of that right unless the Assistant  Secretary for good cause shown grants additional time for requesting  additional procedures. If no time limit is specified in the notice or  order, additional procedures may be requested at any time prior to the  issuance of a final opinion and order. At any time during a proceeding,  the Assistant Secretary or presiding official may on his or her own  initiative determine to provide additional procedures.
