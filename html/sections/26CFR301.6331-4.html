                                Sec. 301.6331-4  Restrictions on levy while installment agreements
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition on levy--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. No levy may be made to  collect a tax liability that is the subject of an installment agreement  during the period that a proposed installment agreement is pending with  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for 30 days immediately following  the rejection of a proposed installment agreement, during the period  that an installment agreement is in effect, and for 30 days immediately  following the termination of an installment agreement. If, within the 30  days following the rejection or termination of an installment agreement,  the taxpayer files an appeal with the IRS Office of Appeals, no levy may  be made while the rejection or termination is being considered by  Appeals. This section will not prohibit levy to collect the liability of  any person other than the person or persons named in the installment  agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a proposed installment agreement becomes pending. A  proposed installment agreement becomes pending when it is accepted for  processing. The IRS may not accept a proposed installment agreement for  processing following reference of a case involving the liability that is  the subject of the proposed installment agreement to the Department of  Justice for prosecution or defense. The proposed installment agreement  remains pending until the IRS accepts the proposal, the IRS notifies the  taxpayer that the proposal has been rejected, or the proposal is  withdrawn by the taxpayer. If a proposed installment agreement that has  been accepted for processing does not contain sufficient information to  permit the IRS to evaluate whether the proposal should be accepted, the  IRS will request the taxpayer to provide the needed additional  information. If the taxpayer does not submit the additional information  that the IRS has requested within a reasonable time period after such a  request, the IRS may reject the proposed installment agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Revised proposals of installment agreements submitted following  rejection. If, following the rejection of a proposed installment  agreement, the taxpayer makes a good faith revision of the proposal and  submits the revision within 30 days of the date of rejection, the  provisions of this section shall apply to that revised proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not prohibit  levy if the taxpayer files a written notice with the IRS that waives the  restriction on levy imposed by this section, the IRS determines that the  proposed installment agreement was submitted solely to delay collection,  or the IRS determines that collection of the tax to which the  installment agreement or proposed installment agreement relates is in  jeopardy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other actions by the IRS while levy is prohibited--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In  general. The IRS may take actions other than levy to protect the  interests of the Government with regard to the liability identified in  an installment agreement or proposed installment agreement. Those  actions include, for example--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Crediting an overpayment against the liability pursuant to  section 6402;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Filing or refiling notices of Federal tax lien; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Taking action to collect from any person who is not named in  the installment agreement or proposed installment agreement but who is  liable for the tax to which the installment agreement relates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the IRS will not refer a case to the Department of  Justice for the commencement of a proceeding in court, against a person  named in an installment agreement or proposed installment agreement, if  levy to collect the liability is prohibited by paragraph   (a)(1) of this section. Without regard to whether a person is named in  an installment agreement or proposed installment agreement, however, the  IRS may authorize the Department of Justice to file a counterclaim or  third-party complaint in a refund action or to join that person in any  other proceeding in which liability for the tax that is the subject of  the installment agreement or proposed installment agreement may be  established or disputed, including a suit against the United States  under 28 U.S.C. 2410. In addition, the United States may file a claim in  any bankruptcy proceeding or insolvency action brought by or against  such person. If a person named in an installment agreement is joined in  a proceeding, the United States obtains a judgment against that person,  and the case is referred back to the IRS for collection, collection will  continue to occur pursuant to the terms of the installment agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statute of limitations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Suspension of the statute of  limitations on collection. The statute of limitations under section 6502  for collection of any liability shall be suspended during the period  that a proposed installment agreement relating to that liability is  pending with the IRS, for 30 days immediately following the rejection of  a proposed installment agreement, and for 30 days immediately following  the termination of an installment agreement. If, within the 30 days  following the rejection or termination of an installment agreement, the  taxpayer files an appeal with the IRS Office of Appeals, the statute of  limitations for collection shall be suspended while the rejection or  termination is being considered by Appeals. The statute of limitations  for collection shall continue to run if an exception under paragraph  (a)(4) of this section applies and levy is not prohibited with respect  to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Waivers of the statute of limitations on collection. The IRS may  continue to request, to the extent permissible under section 6502 and  Sec. 301.6159-1, that the taxpayer agree to a reasonable extension of  the statute of limitations for collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cross-reference. For provisions relating to the making of levies  while an installment agreement is pending or in effect, see Sec.  301.6159-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are  applicable beginning December 18, 2002. Paragraph (d) is applicable  beginning November 25, 2009.  [T.D. 9027, 67 FR 77417, Dec. 18, 2002, as amended by T.D. 9473, 74 FR  61530, Nov. 25, 2009]</p>
