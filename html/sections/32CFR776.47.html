                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Special responsibilities of a trial counsel. A trial counsel  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recommend to the convening authority that any charge or  specification not warranted by the evidence be withdrawn;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been  advised of the right to, and the procedure for obtaining, counsel and  has been given reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not seek to obtain from an unrepresented accused a waiver of  important pretrial rights;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or  information known to the trial counsel that tends to negate the guilt of  the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with  sentencing, disclose to the defense all unprivileged mitigating  information known to the trial counsel, except when the trial counsel is  relieved of this responsibility by a protective order or regulation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law  enforcement personnel, employees, or other persons assisting or  associated with the trial counsel from making an extrajudicial statement  that the trial counsel would be prohibited from making under Sec.  776.45 of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of  the nature and extent of the trial counsel's actions and that serve a  legitimate law enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial  comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public  condemnation of the accused.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Role of the trial counsel. (1) The trial counsel represents the  United States in the prosecution of special and general courts-martial.  See Article 38(a), UCMJ, and R.C.M. 103(16), 405(d)(3)(A), and  502(d)(5), MCM, 1998. Accordingly, a trial counsel has the  responsibility of administering justice and is not simply an advocate.  This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to see that the  accused is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon  the basis of sufficient evidence. Paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this   section recognizes that the trial counsel does not have all the  authority vested in modern civilian prosecutors. The authority to  convene courts-martial, and to refer and withdraw specific charges, is  vested in convening authorities. Trial counsel may have the duty, in  certain circumstances, to bring to the court's attention any charge that  lacks sufficient evidence to support a conviction. See United States v.  Howe, 37 M.J. 1062 (NMCMR 1993). Such action should be undertaken only  after consultation with a supervisory attorney and the convening  authority. See also Sec. 776.42 of this part, governing ex parte  proceedings. Applicable law may require other measures by the trial  counsel. Knowing disregard of those obligations or a systematic abuse of  prosecutorial discretion could constitute a violation of Sec. 776.69 of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ``ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: The Prosecution  Function,'' (3rd ed. 1993), has been used by appellate courts in  analyzing issues concerning trial counsel conduct. To the extent  consistent with this part, the ABA standards may be used to guide trial  counsel in the prosecution of criminal cases. See United States v. Howe,  37 M.J. 1062 (NMCR 1993); United States v. Dancy, 38 M.J. 1 (CMA 1993);  United States v. Hamilton, 41 M.J. 22 (CMA 1994); United States v. Meek,  44 M.J. 1 (CMA 1996).</p>
