                            <p class="depth0">Every consular officer who shall receive money, property, or effects belonging to a citizen of the United States and shall not within a reasonable time after demand made upon him or her by the Secretary of State or by such citizen, his or her executor, administrator, or legal representative, account for and pay over all moneys, property, and effects, less his or her lawful fees, due to such citizen, shall be deemed guilty of embezzlement, and shall be punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years, and by a fine of not more than $2,000 (22 U.S.C. 4217). Penalties of imprisonment and fine are also prescribed for embezzlement in connection with the acceptance, without execution of a prescribed form of bond, of appointment from any

foreign state as administrator, guardian, or to any other office of trust for the settlement or conservation of estates of deceased persons or of their heirs or of persons under legal disabilities (22 U.S.C. 4198 and 4199). Acceptance of such appointments is not ordinarily permitted under existing regulations. See Sec. 92.81 of this chapter.
