                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulations in this subpart C provide uniform rules and  procedures for application, issuance, renewal, conditions, and general  administration of permits issuable pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224  of this chapter. While this section provides generic rules and  procedures applicable to all permits, other sections may provide more  specific rules and procedures with respect to certain types of permits.  In such cases, the requirements in all applicable sections must be  satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Assistant  Administrator may approve variations from the requirements of parts 222,  223, and 224 of this chapter when the Assistant Administrator finds that  an emergency exists and that the proposed variations will not hinder  effective administration of those parts and will not be unlawful. Other  sections within parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter may allow for a  waiver or variation of specific requirements for emergency situations,  upon certain conditions. In such cases, those conditions must be  satisfied in order for the waiver or variation to be lawful.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No person shall take, import, export or engage in any other  prohibited activity involving any species of fish or wildlife under the  jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce that has been determined to be  endangered under the Act, or that has been determined to be threatened  and for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act have been  applied by regulation, without a valid permit issued pursuant to these  regulations. The permit shall entitle the person to whom it is issued to  engage in the activity specified in the permit, subject to the  limitations of the Act and the regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of  this chapter, for the period stated on the permit, unless sooner  modified, suspended or revoked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each person intending to engage in an activity for which a  permit is required by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter or by the  Act shall, before commencing such activity, obtain a valid permit  authorizing such activity.   Any person who desires to obtain permit privileges authorized by parts  222, 223, and 224 of this chapter must apply for such permit in  accordance with the requirements of these sections. If the information  required for each specific, permitted activity is included, one  application may be accepted for all permits required, and a single  permit may be issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any permit issued under these regulations must be in the  possession of the person to whom it is issued (or of an agent of such  person) while any animal subject to the permit is in the possession of  such person or agent. Specifically, a person or his/her agent must be in  possession of a permit during the time of the authorized taking,  importation, exportation, or of any other act and during the period of  any transit incident to such taking, importation, exportation, or to any  other act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A duplicate copy of the issued permit must be physically  attached to the tank, container, package, enclosure, or other means of  containment, in which the animal is placed for purposes of storage,  transit, supervision, or care.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The authorizations on the face of a permit setting forth  specific times, dates, places, methods of taking, numbers and kinds of  fish or wildlife, location of activity, authorize certain circumscribed  transactions, or otherwise permit a specifically limited matter, are to  be strictly construed and shall not be interpreted to permit similar or  related matters outside the scope of strict construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Permits shall not be altered, erased, or mutilated, and any  permit which has been altered, erased, or mutilated shall immediately  become invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any permit issued under parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter  shall be displayed for inspection, upon request, to an authorized  officer, or to any other person relying upon its existence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Permittees may be required to file reports of the activities  conducted under the permit. Any such reports shall be filed not later  than March 31 for the preceding calendar year ending December 31, or any  portion thereof, during which a permit was in force, unless the  regulations of parts 222, 223, or 224 of this chapter or the provisions  of the permit set forth other reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> From the date of issuance of the permit, the permittee shall  maintain complete and accurate records of any taking, possession,  transportation, sale, purchase, barter, exportation, or importation of  fish or wildlife pursuant to such permit. Such records shall be kept  current and shall include the names and addresses of persons with whom  any fish or wildlife has been purchased, sold, bartered, or otherwise  transferred, and the date of such transaction, and such other  information as may be required or appropriate. Such records, unless  otherwise specified, shall be entered in books, legibly written in the  English language. Such records shall be retained for 5 years from the  date of issuance of the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Any person holding a permit pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224  of this chapter shall allow the Assistant Administrator to enter the  permit holder's premises at any reasonable hour to inspect any fish or  wildlife held or to inspect, audit, or copy any permits, books, or  records required to be kept by these regulations or by the Act. Such  person shall display any permit issued pursuant to these regulations or  to the Act upon request by an authorized officer or by any other person  relying on its existence.</p>
