                                Sec. 220.2  Statutory obligation of third party payer to pay.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>, a third party  payer has an obligation to pay the United States the reasonable charges  for healthcare services provided in or through any facility of the  Uniformed Services to a covered beneficiary who is also a beneficiary  under the third party payer's plan. The obligation to pay is to the  extent that the beneficiary would be eligible to receive reimbursement  or indemnification from the third party payer if the beneficiary were to  incur the costs on the beneficiary's own behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of cost shares. If the third party payer's plan  includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary  of the plan, then the amount the United States may collect from the  third party payer   is the reasonable charge for the care provided less the appropriate  deductible or copayment amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claim from United States exclusive. The only way for a third  party payer to satisfy its obligation under 10 U.S.C. 1095 is to pay the  facility of the uniformed service or other authorized representative of  the United States. Payment by a third party payer to the beneficiary  does not satisfy 10 U.S.C. 1095.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment of benefits or other submission by beneficiary not  necessary. The obligation of the third party payer to pay is not  dependent upon the beneficiary executing an assignment of benefits to  the United States. Nor is the obligation to pay dependent upon any other  submission by the beneficiary to the third party payer, including any  claim or appeal. In any case in which a facility of the Uniformed  Services makes a claim, appeal, representation, or other filing under  the authority of this part, any procedural requirement in any third  party payer plan for the beneficiary of such plan to make the claim,  appeal, representation, or other filing must be deemed to be satisfied.  A copy of the completed and signed DoD insurance declaration form will  be provided to payers upon request, in lieu of a claimant's statement or  coordination of benefits form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Preemption of conflicting State laws. Any provision of a law or  regulation of a State or political subdivision thereof that purports to  establish any requirement on a third party payer that would have the  effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment, for any health  care services for which payment by the third party payer under 10 U.S.C.  1095 or this part is required, is preempted by 10 U.S.C. 1095 and shall  have no force or effect in connection with the third party payer's  obligations under 10 U.S.C. 1095 or this part.
