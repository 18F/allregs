                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 5108-070(g)(4) insert the following clause in full text in contracts where the contractor is designated a Limited Fee Planned Producer.</p><p class="depth0">Industrial Preparedness Planning (XXX 1989) (DEV)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Government designates the contractor a Limited Fee Planned Producer (LFPP) for the item(s) listed in paragraph (e) of this clause. As an LFPP for the listed items, the contractor will be solicited for all acquisitions over $25,000 which are for the item(s), excluding those for which competition is restricted to the Restricted Specified Base pursuant to an approved Justification and Approval. The Government reserves the right to obtain the item(s) listed from sources other than the commercial marketplace, i.e. by assigning workload to a government-owned facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor agrees to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Update the Production Capacity Survey DD Form 1519 TEST for each item biennially;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Accomplish subcontractor planning as required in paragraph (f) of this clause;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Permit Government personnel access to records, manufacturing process data, plants and facilities in order to verify data on the Production Capacity Survey DD Form 1519 TEST.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> Maintain the surge/mobilization capacity set forth in the Production Planning Schedules during active production of the item and for a period of (negotiated number) years after physical completion of this production contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Contractor is aware of the Government's dependence upon the Production Planning Schedules as a basis to take appropriate measures to ensure the adequacy of the United States Industrial Base. The Contractor also recognizes the Government's intention to convert Production Planning Schedule to contracts on a selective basis, as may be required to minimize materiel shortages during mobilization or to meet contingencies short of a declared national emergency. The Contractor agrees to accept contracts for the item(s) in accordance with the Production Planning Schedules. In the event mobilization or contingencies short of a declared national emergency occur after active production has ceased, and the allocated capacity is in use for the production of other item(s), the Contractor agrees to immediately discontinue production of such other item(s) if necessary to meet production schedules for the planned item(s). The Contractor further recognizes that it is the Government's intention to require that planned subcontractor support will be similarly converted to production subcontracts. Production delivery obligations under this clause are governed by Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2061, et seq.) (Defense Production Act) and as applicable are within the purview of the Defense Priorities and Allocation System.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the listed item(s), the Contractor certifies by signing this contract that the plant capacity required to support the mobilization quantity listed on the Production Capacity Survey DD Form 1519 TEST will be dedicated exclusively for the production of that item at mobilization. Furthermore, the Contractor certifies that this capacity is not shared by any other mobilization production requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> This clause covers the item(s) listed below:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Item schedule No.               Item nomenclature (sample)------------------------------------------------------------------------M11111....................................  Fuze, Rocket MK987.M22222....................................  Machine Gun, MK35.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subcontractors, suppliers and vendors provide many of the components of military end items. The lack of critical components could be one of the major limitations of the United States' ability to support its Armed Forces warfighting capabilities. Therefore, the Government designated critical components and/or subassemblies in Block 27 of the attached Production Capacity Survey (DD Form 1519 TEST) are those for which the Contractor will conduct vertical planning if not produced in-house. Additional critical components and/or subassemblies may be identified by the Contractor in block 21 of the attached Production Capacity Survey (DD Form 1519 TEST). Foreign producers (other than Canada) will not be considered as a source of supply for critical components. Mandatory vertical (subcontractor) planning will be accomplished by the ASPPO and the Contractor for all critical components identified on the Production Capacity Survey, (DD Form 1519 TEST), by using a sub-tier Production Capacity Survey (DD Form 1519 TEST). The Contractor agrees to coordinate completion of the DD Form 1519 TEST and finalize prime and subcontractor planning with the Armed Services Production Planning Officer (ASPPO) having cognizance over the prime contractor's facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> After completion of active production of the item(s), the Government will annually, or as changes occur but not more than annually, furnish the Contractor updated technical data for the item. The Contractor agrees to review the technical data and to report to the Government within 60 days of receipt of the data, the impact of technical changes, if any, to the current Production Planning Schedules at no additional cost to the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Retention by the Contractor of the surge/mobilization capacity set forth in the Production Planning Schedules after completion of active production of the planned item(s) will not necessarily require that the Contractor maintain such capacity in idle status. Contractor utilization of capacity allocated for planned production for production of other non-planned items is consistent with the intent of any postproduction provisions of this contract, provided no degradation of surge/mobility capacity occurs as a result, and provided that the approval of the Contracting Officer with property cognizance is obtained for the use of any Government-owned property.
