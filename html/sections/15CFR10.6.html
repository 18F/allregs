                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon receipt from the Standard Review Committee of a recommended  standard and report, the Department shall give appropriate public notice  and distribute the recommended standard for acceptance unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon a showing by any member of the committee who has voted to  oppose the recommended standard on the basis of an unresolved objection,  the Department determines that if such objection were not resolved, the  recommended standard:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would be contrary to the public interest, if published;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Would be technically inadequate; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would be inconsistent with law or established public policy;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department determines that all criteria and procedures set  forth herein have not been met satisfactorily or that there is a legal  impediment to the recommended standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Distribution for acceptance or rejection for the purpose of  determining general concurrence will be made to a list compiled by the  Department, which, in the judgment of the Department, shall be  representative of producers, distributors, and users and consumers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Distribution for comment will be made to any party filing a  written request with the Department, and to such other parties as the  Department may deem appropriate, including testing laboratories and  interested State and Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Department shall analyze the recommended standard and the  responses received under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If such  analysis indicates that the recommended standard is supported by a  consensus, it shall be published as a Voluntary Product Standard by the  Department: Provided, That all other requirements listed in these  procedures have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following definitions shall apply to the term used in this  section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Consensus'' means general concurrence and, in addition, no  substantive objection deemed valid by the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``General concurrence'' means acceptance among those responding  to the distribution made under paragraph (b) of this section in  accordance with the conditions set forth in paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Substantive objection'' means a documented objection based on  grounds that one or more of the criteria set forth in these procedures  has not been satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Average industry acceptance'' means a percentage equal to the  sum of the percentages of acceptance obtained from responses to  distribution of the recommended standard in the producer segment, the  distributor segment, and the user and consumer segment, divided by  three. No consideration will be given to volume of production or volume  of distribution in determining average industry acceptance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ``Producer segment'' means those persons who manufacture or  produce the product covered by the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> ``Distributor segment'' means those persons who distribute at  wholesale or retail the product covered by the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> ``User and consumer segment'' means those persons who use or  consume the product covered by the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> ``Acceptance by volume of production'' means the weighted  percentage of acceptance of those responding to the distribution in the  producer segment. The weighting of each response will be made in  accordance with the volume of production represented by each respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> ``Acceptance by volume of distribution'' means the weighted  percentage of acceptance of those responding to the distribution in the  distributor segment. The weighting of each response will be made in  accordance with the volume of distribution represented by each  respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A recommended standard shall be deemed to be supported by  general concurrence whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An analysis of the responses to the distribution under paragraph  (b) of this section indicates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An average industry acceptance of not less than 75 percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acceptance of not less than 70 percent by the producer segment,  the distributor segment, and the user and consumer segment, each segment  being considered separately; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Acceptance by volume of production and acceptance by volume of  distribution of not less than 70 percent in each case: Provided, That  the Department shall disregard acceptance by volume of production or  acceptance by volume of distribution or both unless, in the judgment of  the Department, accurate figures for the volume of production or  distribution are reasonably available and an evaluation of either or  both of such acceptances is deemed necessary by the Department; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department determines that publication of the standard is  appropriate under the procedures set forth in   paragraph (g) of this section and, in addition, an analysis of the  responses to the distribution under paragraph (b) of this section  indicates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An average industry acceptance of not less than 66\2/3\ percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Acceptance of not less than 60 percent by the producer segment,  the distributor segment, and the user and consumer segment, each segment  being considered separately; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Acceptance by volume of production and acceptance by volume of  distribution of not less than 60 percent in each case: Provided, That  the Department shall disregard acceptance by volume of production or  acceptance by volume of distribution or both unless, in the judgment of  the Department, accurate figures for the volume of production or  distribution are reasonably available and an evaluation of either or  both of such acceptances is deemed necessary by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A recommended standard which fails to achieve the acceptance  requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but which satisfies  the acceptance criteria of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, shall be  returned to the Standard Review Committee for reconsideration. The  committee, by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of  all members eligible to vote, may resubmit the recommended standard  without change to the Department with a recommendation that the standard  be published as a Voluntary Product Standard. The Department shall then  conduct a public rulemaking hearing in accordance with the requirements  of law as set forth in section 553 of Title 5, United States Code, to  assist it in determining whether publication of the standard is in the  public interest. If the Department determines that publication of the  standard is in the public interest, the standard shall be published as a  Voluntary Product Standard.</p>
