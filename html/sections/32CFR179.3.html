                            <p class="depth0">This part includes definitions for many terms that clarify its scope  and applicability. Many of the terms relevant to this part are already  defined, either in 10 U.S.C. 101, 10 U.S.C. 2710(e), or the Code of  Federal Regulations. Where this is the case, the statutory and  regulatory definitions are repeated here strictly for ease of reference.  Citations to the U.S. Code or the Code of Federal Regulations are  provided with the definition, as applicable. Unless used elsewhere in  the U.S. Code or the Code of Federal Regulations, these terms are  defined only for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Barrier means a natural obstacle or obstacles (e.g., difficult  terrain, dense vegetation, deep or fast-moving water), a man-made  obstacle or obstacles (e.g., fencing), and combinations of natural and  man-made obstacles.</p><p class="depth0">Chemical agent (CA) means a chemical compound (to include  experimental compounds) that, through its chemical properties produces  lethal or other damaging effects on human beings, is intended for use in  military operations to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate persons  through its physiological effects. Excluded are research, development,  testing and evaluation (RDTE) solutions; riot control agents; chemical  defoliants and herbicides; smoke and other obscuration materials; flame  and incendiary materials; and industrial chemicals. (This definition is  based on the definition of ``chemical agent and munition'' in 50 U.S.C.  1521(j)(1).)</p><p class="depth0">Chemical Agent (CA) Hazard is a condition where danger exists  because CA is present in a concentration high enough to present  potential unacceptable effects (e.g., death, injury, damage) to people,  operational capability, or the environment.</p><p class="depth0">Chemical Warfare Materiel (CWM) means generally configured as a  munition containing a chemical compound that is intended to kill,  seriously injure, or incapacitate a person through its physiological  effects. CWM includes V- and G-series nerve agents or H-series (mustard)  and L-series (lewisite) blister agents in other-than-munition  configurations; and certain industrial chemicals (e.g., hydrogen cyanide  (AC), cyanogen chloride (CK), or carbonyl dichloride (called phosgene or  CG)) configured as a military munition. Due to their hazards,  prevalence, and military-unique application, chemical agent  identification sets (CAIS) are also considered CWM. CWM does not include  riot control devices; chemical defoliants and herbicides; industrial  chemicals (e.g., AC, CK, or CG) not configured as a munition; smoke and  other obscuration-producing items; flame and incendiary-producing items;  or soil, water, debris, or other media contaminated with low  concentrations of chemical agents where no CA hazards exist. For the  purposes of this Protocol, CWM encompasses four subcategories of  specific materials:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> CWM, explosively configured are all munitions that contain a CA  fill and any explosive component. Examples are M55 rockets with CA, the  M23 VX mine, and the M360 105-mm GB artillery cartridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> CWM, nonexplosively configured are all munitions that contain a  CA fill, but that do not contain any explosive   components. Examples are any chemical munition that does not contain  explosive components and VX or mustard agent spray canisters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> CWM, bulk container are all non-munitions-configured containers  of CA (e.g., a ton container) and CAIS K941, toxic gas set M-1 and K942,  toxic gas set M-2/E11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> CAIS are military training aids containing small quantities of  various CA and other chemicals. All forms of CAIS are scored the same in  this rule, except CAIS K941, toxic gas set M-1; and CAIS K942, toxic gas  set M-2/E11, which are considered forms of CWM, bulk container, due to  the relatively large quantities of agent contained in those types of  sets.</p><p class="depth0">Components means the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  Military Departments, the Defense Agencies, the Department Field  Activities, and any other Department organizational entity or  instrumentality established to perform a government function.</p><p class="depth0">Defense site means locations that are or were owned by, leased to,  or otherwise possessed or used by the Department. The term does not  include any operational range, operating storage or manufacturing  facility, or facility that is used for or was permitted for the  treatment or disposal of military munitions. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(1))</p><p class="depth0">Discarded military munitions (DMM) means military munitions that  have been abandoned without proper disposal or removed from storage in a  military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of disposal. The  term does not include UXO, military munitions that are being held for  future use or planned disposal, or military munitions that have been  properly disposed of consistent with applicable environmental laws and  regulations. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(2))</p><p class="depth0">Explosive hazard means a condition where danger exists because  explosives are present that may react (e.g., detonate, deflagrate) in a  mishap with potential unacceptable effects (e.g., death, injury, damage)  to people, property, operational capability, or the environment.</p><p class="depth0">Military munitions means all ammunition products and components  produced for or used by the armed forces for national defense and  security, including ammunition products or components under the control  of the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, the Department of Energy,  and the National Guard. The term includes confined gaseous, liquid, and  solid propellants; explosives, pyrotechnics, chemical and riot control  agents, smokes, and incendiaries, including bulk explosives and chemical  warfare agents; chemical munitions, rockets, guided and ballistic  missiles, bombs, warheads, mortar rounds, artillery ammunition, small  arms ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges, cluster  munitions and dispensers, and demolition charges; and devices and  components of any item thereof. The term does not include wholly inert  items, improvised explosive devices, and nuclear weapons, nuclear  devices, and nuclear components, other than nonnuclear components of  nuclear devices that are managed under the nuclear weapons program of  the Department of Energy after all required sanitization operations  under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) have been  completed. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(4))</p><p class="depth0">Military range means designated land and water areas set aside,  managed, and used to research, develop, test, and evaluate military  munitions, other ordnance, or weapon systems, or to train military  personnel in their use and handling. Ranges include firing lines and  positions, maneuver areas, firing lanes, test pads, detonation pads,  impact areas, and buffer zones with restricted access and exclusionary  areas. (40 CFR 266.201)</p><p class="depth0">Munitions and explosives of concern distinguishes specific  categories of military munitions that may pose unique explosives safety  risks, such as UXO, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(e)(5); discarded  military munitions, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(2); or munitions  constituents (e.g., TNT, RDX), as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(3),  present in high enough concentrations to pose an explosive hazard.</p><p class="depth0">Munitions constituents means any materials originating from UXO,  discarded military munitions, or other military munitions, including  explosive and nonexplosive materials, and   emission, degradation, or breakdown elements of such ordnance or  munitions. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(3))</p><p class="depth0">Munitions response means response actions, including investigation,  removal actions, and remedial actions, to address the explosives safety,  human health, or environmental risks presented by UXO, discarded  military munitions (DMM), or munitions constituents (MC), or to support  a determination that no removal or remedial action is required.</p><p class="depth0">Munitions response area (MRA) means any area on a defense site that  is known or suspected to contain UXO, DMM, or MC. Examples are former  ranges and munitions burial areas. An MRA comprises one or more  munitions response sites.</p><p class="depth0">Munitions response site (MRS) means a discrete location within an  MRA that is known to require a munitions response.</p><p class="depth0">Operational range means a range that is under the jurisdiction,  custody, or control of the Secretary of Defense and that is used for  range activities, or although not currently being used for range  activities, that is still considered by the Secretary to be a range and  has not been put to a new use that is incompatible with range  activities. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(3))</p><p class="depth0">Range means a designated land or water area that is set aside,  managed, and used for range activities of the Department of Defense. The  term includes firing lines and positions, maneuver areas, firing lanes,  test pads, detonation pads, impact areas, electronic scoring sites,  buffer zones with restricted access, and exclusionary areas. The term  also includes airspace areas designated for military use in accordance  with regulations and procedures prescribed by the Administrator of the  Federal Aviation Administration. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(1)(A) and (B))</p><p class="depth0">Range activities means research, development, testing, and  evaluation of military munitions, other ordnance, and weapons systems;  and the training of members of the armed forces in the use and handling  of military munitions, other ordnance, and weapons systems. (10 U.S.C.  101(3)(2))</p><p class="depth0">Unexploded ordnance (UXO) means military munitions that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Have been primed, fuzed, armed, or otherwise prepared for  action;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Have been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such  a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installations,  personnel, or material; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Remain unexploded, whether by malfunction, design, or any other  cause. (10 U.S.C. 101(e)(5))</p><p class="depth2">United States means, in a geographic sense, the states, territories,  and possessions and associated navigable waters, contiguous zones, and  ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive  management authority of the United States. (10 U.S.C. 2710(e)(10))</p>
