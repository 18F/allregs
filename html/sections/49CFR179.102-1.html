The ASTM A 516/A 516M plate must also meet the Charpy V-Notch test requirements of ASTM A 20/A 20M (see table 16) (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter) in the longitudinal direction of rolling. The TC 128 plate must also meet the Charpy V-Notch energy absorption requirements of 15 ft.-lb. minimum average for 3 specimens, and 10 ft.-lb. minimum for one specimen, at minus 50 F in the longitudinal direction of rolling in accord with ASTM A 370 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). Production-welded test plates prepared as required by W4.00 of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix W (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), must include impact test specimens of weld metal and heat-affected zone. As an alternate, anchor legs may be fabricated of stainless steel, ASTM A 240/A 240M Types 304, 304L, 316 or 316L, for which impact tests are not required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)-(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
