                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial denial authority. The DA officials are designated as the Army's only IDAs. Only an IDA, his or her delegate, or the Secretary of the Army can deny FOIA requests for DA records. Each IDA will act on direct and referred requests for records within his or her area of functional responsibility. (See the proper AR in the 10 series for full discussions of these areas. Included are records created or kept within the IDA's area of responsibility; records retired by, or referred to, the IDA's headquarters or office; and records of predecessor organizations. If a request involves the areas of more than one IDA, the IDA to whom the request was originally addressed will normally respond to it; however, the affected IDAs may consult on such requests and agree on responsibility for them. IDAs will complete all required coordination at initial denial level. This includes classified records retired to the NARA when a mandatory declassification review is necessary. Requests and/or responsive documents should not be sent to the DA FOIA/PA Office for initial denial authority or to forward to other offices within the DA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FOIA requesters may ultimately appeal if they are dissatisfied with adverse determinations. It is crucial to forward complete packets to the IDAs. Ensure cover letters list all attachments and describe from where the records were obtained, i.e., a PA system of records (including the applicable systems notice), or other. If a FOIA

action is complicated, include a chronology of events to assist the IDA in understanding what happened in the course of processing the FOIA request. If a file does not include documentation described below, include the tab, and insert a page marked ``not applicable'' or ``not used.'' The order and contents of FOIA file attachments follow: (Tab A or 1) The original FOIA request and envelope (if applicable); (Tab B or 2) The response letter; (Tab C or 3) Copies of all records entirely released, single-sided; (Tab D or 4) Copies of administrative processing documents, including extension letters and ``no records'' certificates, in chronological order; (Tab E or 5) Copies of all records partially released or entirely denied, single-sided. For partially released records, mark in yellow highlighter (or other readable highlighter) those portions withheld; and (Tab F or 6) Legal opinions(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The initial determination of whether to make a record available or grant a fee waiver upon request may be made by any suitable official designated by the Army Activity in published regulations. The presence of the marking ``FOUO'' does not relieve the designated official of the responsibility to review the requested record for the purpose of determining whether an exemption under this part is applicable and should be invoked. IDAs may delegate all or part of their authority to a division chief under its supervision within the Agency in the grade of 05/civilian equivalent. Requests for delegation authority below this level must be submitted, after coordination, to the DA FOIA/PA Office, with detailed justification, for approval. Such delegations must not slow FOIA actions. If an IDA's delegate denies a FOIA or fee waiver request, the delegate must clearly state that he or she is acting for the IDA and identify the IDA by name and position in the written response to the requester. IDAs will send only the names, offices, and telephone numbers of their delegates to the DA, FOIA/PA Office. IDAs will keep this information current.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The officials designated by Army Activities to make initial determinations should consult with public affairs officers (PAOs) to become familiar with subject matters that are considered to be newsworthy, and advise PAOs of all requests from news media representatives. In addition, the officials should inform PAOs in advance when they intend to withhold or partially withhold a record, if it appears that the withholding action may be challenged in the media. A FOIA release or denial action, appeal, or court review may generate public or press interest. In such case, the IDA (or delegate) should consult the Chief of Public Affairs or the command or organization PAO. The IDA should inform the PAO contacted of the issue and obtain advice and recommendations on handling its public affairs aspect. Any advice or recommendations requested or obtained should be limited to this aspect. Coordination must be completed within the statutory 20 working day FOIA response limit. (The point of contact for the Army Chief of Public Affairs is HQDA (SAPA-OSR), Washington DC 20310-1500). If the request involves actual or potential litigation against the United States, release must be coordinated with The Judge Advocate General (TJAG).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following officials are designated IDAs for the areas of responsibility outlined below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army is authorized to act for the Secretary of the Army on requests for all records maintained by the Office of the Secretary of the Army and its serviced activities as well as requests requiring the personal attention of the Secretary of the Army.

These will be published in the Federal Register. You may contact the DA, FOIA/PA Office to obtain current information on special delegations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reasons for not releasing a record. The following are reasons for not complying with a request for a record under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No records. A reasonable search of files failed to identify responsive records. The records custodian will prepare a detailed no records certificate. This certificate must include, at a minimum, what areas or offices were searched and how the search was conducted (manually, by computer, etc.). The certificate will be signed by the records custodian and will include his or her grade and title. The original certificate will be forwarded to the IDA. Preprinted ``check-the-block'' or ``fill-in-the-blank'' no records certificates are not authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Referrals. The request is transferred to another Army Activity or DoD Component, or to another Federal Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Request withdrawn. The request is withdrawn by the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fee-related reason. The requester is unwilling to pay fees associated with a request; the requester is past due in the payment of fees from a previous FOIA request; or the requester disagrees with the fee estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Records not reasonably described. A record has not been described with sufficient particularity to enable the Army or DoD Component to locate it by conducting a reasonable search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Not a proper FOIA request for some other reason. The requester has failed unreasonably to comply with procedural requirements, other than fee-related, imposed by this part or Army Activity supplementing regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Not an agency record. The information requested is not a record within the meaning of the FOIA and this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Duplicate request. The request is a duplicate request (e.g., a requester asks for the same information more than once). This includes identical requests received via different means (e.g., electronic mail, facsimile, mail, and courier) at the same or different times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Other (specify). Any other reason a requester does not comply with published rules other than those outlined in paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Partial or total denial. The record is denied in whole or in part in accordance with procedures set forth in the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Denial tests. To deny a requested record that is in the possession and control of an Army Activity, it must be determined that the record is exempt under one or more of the exemptions of the FOIA. An outline of the FOIA's exemptions is contained in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reasonably segregable portions. Although portions of some records may be denied, the remaining reasonably segregable portions must be released to the requester when it reasonably can be assumed that a skillful and knowledgeable person could not reconstruct the excised information. Unless indicating the extent of the deletion would harm an interest protected by an exemption, the amount of deleted information shall be indicated on the released portion of paper records by use of brackets or darkened areas indicating removal of information. In no case shall the deleted areas be left ``white'' without the use of brackets to show the bounds of deleted information. In the case of electronic deletion, or deletion in audiovisual or microfiche records, if technically feasible, the amount of redacted information shall be indicated at the place in the record such deletion was made, unless including the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption under which the deletion is made. This may be done by use of brackets, shaded areas, or some other identifiable technique that will clearly show the limits of the deleted information. When a record is denied in whole, the response advising the requester of that determination will specifically state that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Response to requester. Whenever possible, initial determinations to release or deny a record normally shall be made and the decision reported to the requester within 20 working days after receipt of a proper request by the official designated to respond. When an Army Activity has a significant number of pending requests which prevent a response determination within the 20 working day period, the requester shall be so notified in an interim response, and advised whether their request qualifies for the fast track or slow track within the Army Activity's multitrack processing system. Requesters who do not meet the criteria for fast track processing shall be given the opportunity to limit the scope of their request in order to qualify for fast track processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a decision is made to release a record, a copy should be made available promptly to the requester once he has complied with preliminary procedural requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a request for a record is denied in whole or in part, the official designated to respond shall inform the requester in writing of the name and title or position of the official who made the determination, and shall explain to the requester the basis for the determination in sufficient detail to permit the requester to make a decision concerning appeal. The requester specifically shall be informed of the exemptions on which the denial is based, inclusive of a brief statement describing what the exemption(s) cover. When the initial denial is based in whole or in part on a security classification, the explanation should include a summary of the applicable Executive Order criteria for classification, as well as an explanation, to the extent reasonably feasible, of how those criteria apply to the particular record in question. The requester shall also be advised of the opportunity and procedures for appealing an unfavorable determination to a higher final authority within the Army Activity. The IDA will inform the requester of his or her right to appeal, in whole or part, the denial of the FOIA

or fee waiver request and that the appeal must be sent through the IDA to the Secretary of the Army (ATTN: OGC).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The final response to the requester should contain information concerning the fee status of the request, consistent with the provisions of subpart F, of this part. When a requester is assessed fees for processing a request, the requester's fee category shall be specified in the response letter. Activities also shall provide the requester with a complete cost breakdown (e.g., 115 pages of office reproduction at $0.15 per page; 5 minutes of computer search time at $43.50 per minute, 3 hours of professional level search at $44 per hour, etc.) in the response letter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The explanation of the substantive basis for a denial shall include specific citation of the statutory exemption applied under provisions of this part; e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1). Merely referring to a classification; to a ``FOUO'' marking on the requested record; or to this part or an Army Activity's regulation does not constitute a proper citation or explanation of the basis for invoking an exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the time for response becomes an issue, the official responsible for replying shall acknowledge to the requester the date of the receipt of the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When denying a request for records, in whole or in part, an Army Activity shall make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of the records denied and provide this estimate to the requester, unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by an exemption of the FOIA. This estimate should be in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation, unless the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When denying a request for records in accordance with a statute qualifying as a FOIA exemption 3 statute, Army Activities shall, in addition to stating the particular statute relied upon to deny the information, also state whether a court has upheld the decision to withhold the information under the particular statute, and a concise description of the scope of the information being withheld.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Extension of time. In unusual circumstances, when additional time is needed to respond to the initial request, the Army Activity shall acknowledge the request in writing within 20 working days, describe the circumstances requiring the delay, and indicate the anticipated date for a substantive response that may not exceed 10 additional working days, except as provided below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to a request for which a written notice has extended the time limits by 10 additional working days, and the Activity determines that it cannot make a response determination within that additional 10 working day period, the requester shall be notified and provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the extended time limit, or an opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. Refusal by the requester to reasonably modify the request or arrange for an alternative time frame shall be considered a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist with respect to Army Activity's request backlogs. Exceptional circumstances do not include a delay that results from predictable activity backlogs, unless the Army Activity demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unusual circumstances that may justify delay are: The need to search for and collect the requested records from other facilities that are separate from the office determined responsible for a release or denial decision on the requested information; the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are requested in a single request; and the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more Army Activities or DoD Components having a substantial subject-matter interest in the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Army Activities may aggregate certain requests by the same requester,

or by a group of requesters acting in concert, if the Army Activity reasonably believes that such requests actually constitute a single request, which would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances set forth in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, and the requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated. If the requests are aggregated under these conditions, the requester or requesters shall be so notified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In cases where the statutory time limits cannot be met and no informal extension of time has been agreed to, the inability to process any part of the request within the specified time should be explained to the requester with a request that he agree to await a substantive response by an anticipated date. It should be made clear that any such agreement does not prejudice the right of the requester to appeal the initial decision after it is made. Army Activities are reminded that the requester still retains the right to treat this delay as a de facto denial with full administrative remedies. Only the responsible IDA can extend it, and the IDA must first coordinate with the OGC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> As an alternative to the taking of formal extensions of time the negotiation by the cognizant FOIA coordinating office of informal extensions in time with requesters is encouraged where appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Misdirected requests. Misdirected requests shall be forwarded promptly to the Army Activity or other Federal Agency with the responsibility for the records requested. The period allowed for responding to the request misdirected by the requester shall not begin until the request is received by the Army Activity that manages the records requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Records of non-U.S. Government source. When a request is received for a record that falls under exemption 4, that was obtained from a non-U.S. Government source, or for a record containing information clearly identified as having been provided by a non-U.S. Government source, the source of the record or information [also known as ``the submitter'' for matters pertaining to proprietary data under 5 U.S.C. 552, FOIA, Exemption (b)(4)] and E.O. 12600], shall be notified promptly of that request and afforded reasonable time (14 calendar days) to present any objections concerning the release, unless it is clear that there can be no valid basis for objection. This practice is required for those FOIA requests for data not deemed clearly exempt from disclosure under exemption (b)(4) of 5 U.S.C. 552, The FOIA. If, for example, the record or information was provided with actual or presumptive knowledge of the non-U.S. Government source and established that it would be made available to the public upon request, there is no obligation to notify the source. Any objections shall be evaluated. The final decision to disclose information claimed to be exempt under exemption (b)(4) shall be made by an official equivalent in rank to the official who would make the decision to withhold that information under FOIA. When a substantial issue has been raised, the Army Activity may seek additional information from the source of the information and afford the source and requester reasonable opportunities to present their arguments on the legal and substantive issues involved prior to making an agency determination. When the source seeks a restraining order or take court action to prevent release of the record or information, the requester shall be notified, and action on the request normally shall not be taken until after the outcome of that court action is known. When the requester brings court action to compel disclosure, the submitter shall be promptly notified of this action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the submitted information is a proposal in response to a solicitation for a competitive proposal, and the proposal is in the possession and control of DA (see 10 U.S.C. 2305(g)), the proposal shall not be disclosed, and no submitter notification and subsequent analysis is required. The proposal shall be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2305(g) and exemption (b)(3) of the FOIA. This statute does not apply to bids, unsolicited proposals, or any proposal that is set forth or incorporated by reference in a contract between an Army Activity and

the offeror that submitted the proposal. In such situations, normal submitter notice shall be conducted except for sealed bids that are opened and read to the public. The term, proposal, means information contained in or originating from any proposal, including a technical, management, or cost proposal submitted by an offeror in response to solicitation for a competitive proposal, but does not include an offeror's name or total price or unit prices when set forth in a record other than the proposal itself. Submitter notice, and analysis as appropriate, are required for exemption (b)(4) matters that are not specifically incorporated in 10 U.S.C. 2305(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the record or information was submitted on a strictly voluntary basis, absent any exercised authority that prescribes criteria for submission, and after consultation with the submitter, it is absolutely clear that the record or information would customarily not be released to the public, the submitter need not be notified. Examples of exercised authorities prescribing criteria for submission are statutes, Executive Orders, regulations, invitations for bids, requests for proposals, and contracts. Records or information submitted under these authorities are not voluntary in nature. When it is not clear whether the information was submitted on a voluntary basis, absent any exercised authority, and whether it would customarily be released to the public by the submitter, notify the submitter and ask that it describe its treatment of the information, and render an objective evaluation. If the decision is made to release the information over the objection of the submitter, notify the submitter and afford the necessary time to allow the submitter to seek a restraining order, or take court action to prevent release of the record or information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The coordination provisions of this section also apply to any non-U.S. Government record in the possession and control of the Army or DoD from multi-national organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), United Nations Commands, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the Inter-American Defense Board, or foreign governments. Coordination with foreign governments under the provisions of this section may be made through Department of State, or the specific foreign embassy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> File of initial denials.
