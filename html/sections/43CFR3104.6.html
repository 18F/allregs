                            <p class="depth0">All bonds shall be filed in the proper BLM office on a current form approved by the Director. A single copy executed by the principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable surety is sufficient. A bond filed on a form not currently in use shall be acceptable, unless such form has been declared obsolete by the Director prior to the filing of such bond. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 3104.2 and 3104.3(a) of this title, bonds or bond riders shall be filed in the Bureau State office having jurisdiction of the lease or operations covered by the bond or rider. Nationwide bonds may be filed in any Bureau State office (See Sec. 1821.2-1).
