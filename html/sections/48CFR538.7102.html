Administrator of General Services to provide to State and local governments the use of Federal Supply Schedules of the GSA for purchase of products and services to be used to facilitate recovery from a major disaster declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) or to facilitate recovery from terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. Section 833 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine which products and services qualify before the Administrator provides for the use of the Federal Supply Schedules. Use of Federal supply schedules by State and local governments is voluntary. Agreement of a schedule contractor to offer recovery purchasing under the contract and acceptance of any order for recovery purchasing from a State or local government is voluntary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State and local governments are authorized to use Federal Supply Schedules to procure products and services determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security to be used to facilitate recovery from major disasters, terrorism, or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack.
