For purposes of  calculating the length of a quiet zone, the presence of a wayside horn  at a highway-grade crossing within a quiet zone shall be considered in  the same manner as a grade crossing treated with an SSM. A grade  crossing equipped with a wayside horn shall not be considered in  calculating the Quiet Zone Risk Index or Crossing Corridor Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A public authority installing a wayside horn at a grade crossing  within a quiet zone shall provide written notice that a wayside horn is  being installed to all railroads operating over the public highway-rail  grade crossings within the quiet zone, the highway or traffic control  authority or law enforcement authority having control over vehicular  traffic at the crossings within the quiet zone, the landowner having  control over any private crossings within the quiet zone, the State  agency responsible for grade crossing safety, the State agency  responsible for highway and road safety, and the Associate  Administrator.

Appendix A to Part 222--Approved Supplementary Safety Measures</p><p class="depth0">A. Requirements and Effectiveness Rates for Supplementary Safety</p><p class="depth0">Measures</p><p class="depth0">This section provides a list of approved supplementary safety  measures (SSMs) that may be installed at highway-rail grade crossings  within quiet zones for risk reduction credit. Each SSM has been assigned  an effectiveness rate, which may be subject to adjustment as research  and demonstration projects are completed and data is gathered and  refined. Sections B and C govern the process through which risk  reduction credit for pre-existing SSMs can be determined.</p><p class="depth0">1. Temporary Closure of a Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossing: Close  the crossing to highway traffic during designated quiet periods. (This  SSM can only be implemented within Partial Quiet Zones.)</p><p class="depth0">Effectiveness: 1.0.</p><p class="depth0">Because an effective closure system prevents vehicle entrance onto  the crossing, the probability of a collision with a train at the  crossing is zero during the period the crossing is closed. Effectiveness  would therefore equal 1. However, analysis should take into  consideration that traffic would need to be redistributed among adjacent  crossings or grade separations for the purpose of estimating risk  following the silencing of train horns, unless the particular  ``closure'' was accomplished by a grade separation.</p><p class="depth0">Required:</p><p class="depth0">a. The closure system must completely block highway traffic on all  approach lanes to the crossing.</p><p class="depth0">b. The closure system must completely block adjacent pedestrian  crossings.</p><p class="depth0">c. Public highway-rail grade crossings located within New Partial  Quiet Zones shall be closed from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. every day. Public  highway-rail grade crossings located within Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones  may only be closed during one period each 24 hours.</p><p class="depth0">d. Barricdes and signs used for closure of the roadway shall conform  to the standards contained in the MUTCD.</p><p class="depth0">e. Daily activation and deactivation of the system is the  responsibility of the public authority responsible for maintenance of  the street or highway crossing the railroad tracks. The public authority  may provide for third party activation and deactivation; however, the  public authority shall remain fully responsible for compliance with the  requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">f. The system must be tamper and vandal resistant to the same extent  as other traffic control devices.</p><p class="depth0">g. The closure system shall be equipped with a monitoring device  that contains an indicator which is visible to the train crew prior to  entering the crossing. The indicator shall illuminate whenever the  closure device is deployed.</p><p class="depth0">Recommended:</p><p class="depth0">Signs for alternate highway traffic routes should be erected in  accordance with MUTCD and State and local standards and should inform  pedestrians and motorists that the streets are closed, the period for  which they are closed, and that alternate routes must be used.</p><p class="depth0">2. Four-Quadrant Gate System: Install gates at a crossing sufficient  to fully block highway traffic from entering the crossing when the gates  are lowered, including at least one gate for each direction of traffic  on each approach.</p><p class="depth0">Effectiveness:</p><p class="depth0">Four-quadrant gates only, no presence detection: .82.</p><p class="depth0">Four-quadrant gates only, with presence detection: .77.</p><p class="depth0">Four-quadrant gates with traffic of at least 60 feet (with or  without presence detection): .92.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The higher effectiveness rate for four-quadrant gates without  presence detection does not mean that they are inherently safer than  four-quadrant gates with presence detection. Four-quadrant gates with  presence detection have been assigned a lower effectiveness rate because  motorists may learn to delay the lowering of the exit gates by driving  onto the opposing lane of traffic immediately after an opposing car has  driven over the grade crossing. Since the presence detection will keep  the exit gate raised, other motorists at the crossing who observe this  scenario may also be tempted to take advantage of the raised exit gate  by driving around the lowered entrance gates, thus increasing the  potential for a crossing collision.</p><p class="depth0">It should, however, be noted that there are site-specific  circumstances (such as nearby highway intersections that could cause  traffic to back up and stop on the grade crossing), under which the use  of presence detection would be advisable. For this reason, the various  effectiveness rates assigned to four-quadrant gate systems should not be  the sole determining factor as to whether presence detection would be  advisable. A site-specific study should be performed to determine the  best application for each proposed installation. Please refer to  paragraphs (f) and (g) for more information.</p><p class="depth0">Required:</p><p class="depth0">Four-quadrant gate systems shall conform to the standards for four- quadrant gates contained in the MUTCD and shall, in addition, comply  with the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. When a train is approaching, all highway approach and exit lanes  on both sides of the highway-rail crossing must be spanned by gates,  thus denying to the highway user the option of circumventing the  conventional approach lane gates by switching into the opposing  (oncoming) traffic lane in order to enter the crossing and cross the  tracks.</p><p class="depth0">b. Crossing warning systems must be activated by use of constant  warning time devices unless existing conditions at the crossing would  prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time devices.</p><p class="depth0">c. Crossing warning systems must be equipped with power-out  indicators.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Requirements b and c apply only to New Quiet Zones or New  Partial Quiet Zones. Constant warning time devices and power-out  indicators are not required to be added to existing warning systems in  Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. However, if  existing automatic warning device systems in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and  Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones are renewed, or new automatic warning  device systems are installed, power-out indicators and constant warning  time devices are required, unless existing conditions at the crossing  would prevent the proper operation of the constant warning devices.</p><p class="depth0">d. The gap between the ends of the entrance and exit gates (on the  same side of the railroad tracks) when both are in the fully lowered, or  down, position must be less than two feet if no median is present. If  the highway approach is equipped with a median or a channelization  device between the approach and exit lanes, the lowered gates must reach  to within one foot of the median or channelization device, measured  horizontally across the road from the end of the lowered gate to the  median or channelization device or to a point over the edge of the  median or channelization device. The gate and the median top or  channelization device do not have to be at the same elevation.</p><p class="depth0">e. ``Break-away'' channelization devices must be frequently  monitored to replace broken elements.</p><p class="depth0">Recommendations for new installations only:</p><p class="depth0">f. Gate timing should be established by a qualified traffic engineer  based on site specific determinations. Such determination should  consider the need for and timing of a delay in the descent of the exit  gates (following descent of the conventional entrance gates). Factors to  be considered may include available storage space between the gates that  is outside the fouling limits of the track(s) and the possibility that  traffic flows may be interrupted as a result of nearby intersections.</p><p class="depth0">g. A determination should be made as to whether it is necessary to  provide vehicle presence detectors (VPDs) to open or keep open the exit  gates until all vehicles are clear of the crossing. VPD should be  installed on one or both sides of the crossing and/or in the surface  between the rails closest to the field. Among the factors that should be  considered are the presence of intersecting roadways near the crossing,  the priority that the traffic crossing the railroad is given at such  intersections, the types of traffic control devices at those  intersections, and the presence and timing of traffic signal preemption.</p><p class="depth0">h. Highway approaches on one or both sides of the highway-rail  crossing may be provided with medians or channelization devices between  the opposing lanes. Medians should be defined by a non-traversable curb  or traversable curb, or by reflectorized channelization devices, or by  both.</p><p class="depth0">i. Remote monitoring (in addition to power-out indicators, which are  required) of the status of these crossing systems is preferable. This is  especially important in those areas in which qualified railroad signal  department personnel are not readily available.</p><p class="depth0">3. Gates With Medians or Channelization Devices: Install medians or  channelization devices on both highway approaches to a public highway- rail grade crossing denying to the highway user the option of  circumventing the approach lane gates by switching into the opposing  (oncoming) traffic lane and driving around the lowered gates to cross  the tracks.</p><p class="depth0">Effectiveness:</p><p class="depth0">Channelization devices--.75.</p><p class="depth0">Non-traversable curbs with or without channelization devices-- .80.</p><p class="depth0">Required:</p><p class="depth0">a. Opposing traffic lanes on both highway approaches to the crossing  must be separated by either: (1) medians bounded by non-traversable  curbs or (2) channelization devices.</p><p class="depth0">b. Medians or channelization devices must extend at least 100 feet  from the gate arm, or if there is an intersection within 100 feet of the  gate, the median or channelization device must extend at least 60 feet  from the gate arm.</p><p class="depth0">c. Intersections of two or more streets, or a street and an alley,  that are within 60 feet of the gate arm must be closed or relocated.  Driveways for private, residential properties (up to four units) within  60 feet of the gate arm are not considered to be intersections under  this part and need not be closed. However, consideration should be given  to taking steps to ensure that motorists exiting the driveways are not  able to move against the flow of traffic to circumvent the purpose of  the median and drive around lowered gates. This may be accomplished by  the posting of ``no left turn'' signs or other means of notification.  For the purpose of this part, driveways accessing commercial properties  are   considered to be intersections and are not allowed. It should be noted  that if a public authority can not comply with the 60 feet or 100 feet  requirement, it may apply to FRA for a quiet zone under Sec. 222.39(b),  ``Public authority application to FRA.'' Such arrangement may qualify  for a risk reduction credit in calculation of the Quiet Zone Risk Index.  Similarly, if a public authority finds that it is feasible to only  provide channelization on one approach to the crossing, it may also  apply to FRA for approval under Sec. 222.39(b). Such an arrangement may  also qualify for a risk reduction credit in calculation of the Quiet  Zone Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0">d. Crossing warning systems must be activated by use of constant  warning time devices unless existing conditions at the crossing would  prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time devices.</p><p class="depth0">e. Crossing warning systems must be equipped with power-out  indicators. Note: Requirements d and e apply only to New Quiet Zones and  New Partial Quiet Zones. Constant warning time devices and power-out  indicators are not required to be added to existing warning systems in  Pre-Rule Quiet Zones or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. However, if  existing automatic warning device systems in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and  Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones are renewed, or new automatic warning  device systems are installed, power-out indicators and constant warning  time devices are required, unless existing conditions at the crossing  would prevent the proper operation of the constant warning devices.</p><p class="depth0">f. The gap between the lowered gate and the curb or channelization  device must be one foot or less, measured horizontally across the road  from the end of the lowered gate to the curb or channelization device or  to a point over the curb edge or channelization device. The gate and the  curb top or channelization device do not have to be at the same  elevation.</p><p class="depth0">g. ``Break-away'' channelization devices must be frequently  monitored to replace broken elements.</p><p class="depth0">4. One Way Street with Gate(s): Gate(s) must be installed such that  all approaching highway lanes to the public highway-rail grade crossing  are completely blocked.</p><p class="depth0">Effectiveness: .82.</p><p class="depth0">Required:</p><p class="depth0">a. Gate arms on the approach side of the crossing should extend  across the road to within one foot of the far edge of the pavement. If a  gate is used on each side of the road, the gap between the ends of the  gates when both are in the lowered, or down, position must be no more  than two feet.</p><p class="depth0">b. If only one gate is used, the edge of the road opposite the gate  mechanism must be configured with a non-traversable curb extending at  least 100 feet.</p><p class="depth0">c. Crossing warning systems must be activated by use of constant  warning time devices unless existing conditions at the crossing would  prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time devices.</p><p class="depth0">d. Crossing warning systems must be equipped with power-out  indicators.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Requirements c and d apply only to New Quiet Zones and New  Partial Quiet Zones. Constant warning time devices and power-out  indicators are not required to be added to existing warning systems in  Pre-Rule Quiet Zones or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. If automatic  warning systems are, however, installed or renewed in a Pre-Rule Quiet  or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone, power-out indicators and constant  warning time devices shall be installed, unless existing conditions at  the crossing would prevent the proper operation of the constant warning  time devices.</p><p class="depth0">5. Permanent Closure of a Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossing:  Permanently close the crossing to highway traffic.</p><p class="depth0">Effectiveness: 1.0.</p><p class="depth0">Required:</p><p class="depth0">a. The closure system must completely block highway traffic from  entering the grade crossing.</p><p class="depth0">b. Barricades and signs used for closure of the roadway shall  conform to the standards contained in the MUTCD.</p><p class="depth0">c. The closure system must be tamper and vandal resistant to the  same extent as other traffic control devices.</p><p class="depth0">d. Since traffic will be redistributed among adjacent crossings, the  traffic counts for adjacent crossings shall be increased to reflect the  diversion of traffic from the closed crossing.  B. Credit for Pre-Existing SSMs in New Quiet Zones and New Partial Quiet</p><p class="depth0">Zones</p><p class="depth0">A community that has implemented a pre-existing SSM at a public  grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the Risk  Index With Horns as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculate the current risk index for the grade crossing that is  equipped with a qualifying, pre-existing SSM. (See appendix D. FRA's  web-based Quiet Zone Calculator may be used to complete this  calculation.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that  was avoided by implementing the pre-existing SSM at the public grade  crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index by one  minus the SSM effectiveness rate. (For example, the risk index for a  crossing equipped with pre-existing channelization devices would be  divided by .25.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Add the current risk indices for the other public grade crossings  located within the proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of  crossings. The resulting risk index   will be the new Risk Index With Horns for the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">C. Credit for Pre-Existing SSMs in Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule</p><p class="depth0">Partial Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">A community that has implemented a pre-existing SSM at a public  grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the Risk  Index With Horns as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Calculate the current risk index for the grade crossing that is  equipped with a qualifying, pre-existing SSM. (See appendix D. FRA's  web-based Quiet Zone Calculator may be used to complete this  calculation.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Reduce the current risk index for the grade crossing to reflect  the risk reduction that would have been achieved if the locomotive horn  was routinely sounded at the crossing. The following list sets forth the  estimated risk reduction for certain types of crossings:</p><p class="depth0">a. Risk indices for passive crossings shall be reduced by 43%;</p><p class="depth0">b. Risk indices for grade crossings equipped with automatic flashing  lights shall be reduced by 27%; and</p><p class="depth0">c. Risk indices for gated crossings shall be reduced by 40%.</p><p class="depth0">3. Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that  was avoided by implementing the pre-existing SSM at the public grade  crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index by one  minus the SSM effectiveness rate. (For example, the risk index for a  crossing equipped with pre-existing channelization devices would be  divided by .25.)</p><p class="depth0">4. Adjust the risk indices for the other crossings that are included  in the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone by reducing  the current risk index to reflect the risk reduction that would have  been achieved if the locomotive horn was routinely sounded at each  crossing. Please refer to step two for the list of approved risk  reduction percentages by crossing type.</p><p class="depth0">5. Add the new risk indices for each crossing located within the  proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of crossings. The resulting  risk index will be the new Risk Index With Horns for the quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 222--Alternative Safety Measures</p><p class="depth0">Introduction</p><p class="depth0">A public authority seeking approval of a quiet zone under public  authority application to FRA (Sec. 222.39(b)) may include ASMs listed in  this appendix in its proposal. This appendix addresses three types of  ASMs: Modified SSMs, Non-Engineering ASMs, and Engineering ASMs.  Modified SSMs are SSMs that do not fully comply with the provisions  listed in appendix A. As provided in section I.B. of this appendix,  public authorities can obtain risk reduction credit for pre-existing  modified SSMs under the final rule. Non-engineering ASMs consist of  programmed enforcement, public education and awareness, and photo  enforcement programs that may be used to reduce risk within a quiet  zone. Engineering ASMs consist of engineering improvements that address  underlying geometric conditions, including sight distance, that are the  source of increased risk at crossings.</p><p class="depth0">I. Modified SSMs</p><p class="depth0">A. Requirements and Effectiveness Rates for Modified SSMs</p><p class="depth0">1. If there are unique circumstances pertaining to a specific  crossing or number of crossings which prevent SSMs from being fully  compliant with all of the SSM requirements listed in appendix A, those  SSM requirements may be adjusted or revised. In that case, the SSM, as  modified by the public authority, will be treated as an ASM under this  appendix B, and not as a SSM under appendix A. After reviewing the  estimated safety effect of the modified SSM and the proposed quiet zone,  FRA will approve the proposed quiet zone if FRA finds that the Quiet  Zone Risk Index will be reduced to a level at or below either the Risk  Index With Horns or the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.</p><p class="depth0">2. The public authority must provide estimates of effectiveness.  These estimates may be based upon adjustments from the effectiveness  levels provided in appendix A or from actual field data derived from the  crossing sites. The specific crossing and applied mitigation measure  will be assessed to determine the effectiveness of the modified SSM. FRA  will continue to develop and make available effectiveness estimates and  data from experience under the final rule.</p><p class="depth0">3. If one or more of the requirements associated with an SSM as  listed in appendix A is revised or deleted, data or analysis supporting  the revision or deletion must be provided to FRA for review. The  following engineering types of ASMs may be included in a proposal for  approval by FRA for creation of a quiet zone: (1) Temporary Closure of a  Public Highway-Rail Grade Crossing, (2) Four-Quadrant Gate System, (3)  Gates With Medians or Channelization Devices, and (4) One-Way Street  With Gate(s).</p><p class="depth0">B. Credit for Pre-Existing Modified SSMs in New Quiet Zones and New</p><p class="depth0">Partial Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">A community that has implemented a pre-existing modified SSM at a  public grade crossing can receive risk reduction credit by inflating the  Risk Index With Horns as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1.

Adjust the risk index by accounting for the increased risk that  was avoided by implementing the pre-existing modified SSM at the public  grade crossing. This adjustment can be made by dividing the risk index  by one minus the FRA-approved modified SSM effectiveness rate.</p><p class="depth0">4. Add the current risk indices for the other public grade crossings  located within the proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of  crossings. The resulting risk index will be the new Risk Index With  Horns for the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">C.

Adjust the risk indices for the other crossings that are included  in the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone by reducing  the current risk index to reflect the risk reduction that would have  been achieved if the locomotive horn was routinely sounded at each  crossing. Please refer to step two for the list of approved risk  reduction percentages by crossing type.</p><p class="depth0">6. Add the new risk indices for each crossing located within the  proposed quiet zone and divide by the number of crossings. The resulting  risk index will be the new Risk Index With Horns for the quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">II. Non-Engineering ASMs</p><p class="depth0">A. The following non-engineering ASMs may be used in the creation of  a Quiet Zone: (The method for determining the effectiveness of the non- engineering ASMs, the implementation of the quiet zone, subsequent  monitoring requirements, and dealing with an unacceptable effectiveness  rate is provided in paragraph B.)</p><p class="depth0">1. Programmed Enforcement: Community and law enforcement officials  commit to a systematic and measurable crossing monitoring and traffic  law enforcement program at the public highway-rail grade crossing, alone  or in combination with the Public Education and Awareness ASM.</p><p class="depth0">Required:</p><p class="depth0">a. Subject to audit, a statistically valid baseline violation rate  must be established through automated or systematic manual monitoring or  sampling at the subject crossing(s); and</p><p class="depth0">b. A law enforcement effort must be defined, established and  continued along with continual or regular monitoring that provides a  statistically valid violation rate that indicates the effectiveness of  the law enforcement effort.</p><p class="depth0">c. The public authority shall retain records pertaining to  monitoring and sampling efforts at the grade crossing for a period of  not less than five years. These records shall be made available, upon  request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.</p><p class="depth0">2. Public Education and Awareness: Conduct, alone or in combination  with programmed law enforcement, a program of public education and  awareness directed at motor vehicle drivers, pedestrians and residents  near the railroad to emphasize the risks associated with public highway- rail grade crossings and applicable requirements of state and local  traffic laws at those crossings.</p><p class="depth0">Requirements:</p><p class="depth0">a. Subject to audit, a statistically valid baseline violation rate  must be established through automated or systematic manual monitoring or  sampling at the subject crossing(s); and</p><p class="depth0">b. A sustainable public education and awareness program must be  defined, established and continued along with continual or regular  monitoring that provides a statistically valid violation rate that  indicates the effectiveness of the public education and   awareness effort. This program shall be provided and supported primarily  through local resources.</p><p class="depth0">c. The public authority shall retain records pertaining to  monitoring and sampling efforts at the grade crossing for a period of  not less than five years. These records shall be made available, upon  request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.</p><p class="depth0">3. Photo Enforcement: This ASM entails automated means of gathering  valid photographic or video evidence of traffic law violations at a  public highway-rail grade crossing together with follow-through by law  enforcement and the judiciary.</p><p class="depth0">Requirements:</p><p class="depth0">a. State law authorizing use of photographic or video evidence both  to bring charges and sustain the burden of proof that a violation of  traffic laws concerning public highway-rail grade crossings has  occurred, accompanied by commitment of administrative, law enforcement  and judicial officers to enforce the law;</p><p class="depth0">b. Sanction includes sufficient minimum fine (e.g., $100 for a first  offense, ``points'' toward license suspension or revocation) to deter  violations;</p><p class="depth0">c. Means to reliably detect violations (e.g., loop detectors, video  imaging technology);</p><p class="depth0">d. Photographic or video equipment deployed to capture images  sufficient to document the violation (including the face of the driver,  if required to charge or convict under state law).</p><p class="depth0">Note: This does not require that each crossing be continually  monitored. The objective of this option is deterrence, which may be  accomplished by moving photo/video equipment among several crossing  locations, as long as the motorist perceives the strong possibility that  a violation will lead to sanctions. Each location must appear identical  to the motorist, whether or not surveillance equipment is actually  placed there at the particular time. Surveillance equipment should be in  place and operating at each crossing at least 25 percent of each  calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth0">e. Appropriate integration, testing and maintenance of the system to  provide evidence supporting enforcement;</p><p class="depth0">f. Public awareness efforts designed to reinforce photo enforcement  and alert motorists to the absence of train horns;</p><p class="depth0">g. Subject to audit, a statistically valid baseline violation rate  must be established through automated or systematic manual monitoring or  sampling at the subject crossing(s); and</p><p class="depth0">h. A law enforcement effort must be defined, established and  continued along with continual or regular monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">i. The public authority shall retain records pertaining to  monitoring and sampling efforts at the grade crossing for a period of  not less than five years. These records shall be made available, upon  request, to FRA as provided by 49 U.S.C. 20107.</p><p class="depth0">B. The effectiveness of an ASM will be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Establish the quarterly (three months) baseline violation rates  for each crossing in the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">a. A violation in this context refers to a motorist not complying  with the automatic warning devices at the crossing (not stopping for the  flashing lights and driving over the crossing after the gate arms have  started to descend, or driving around the lowered gate arms). A  violation does not have to result in a traffic citation for the  violation to be considered.</p><p class="depth0">b. Violation data may be obtained by any method that can be shown to  provide a statistically valid sample. This may include the use of video  cameras, other technologies (e.g., inductive loops), or manual  observations that capture driver behavior when the automatic warning  devices are operating.</p><p class="depth0">c. If data is not collected continuously during the quarter,  sufficient detail must be provided in the application in order to  validate that the methodology used results in a statistically valid  sample. FRA recommends that at least a minimum of 600 samples (one  sample equals one gate activation) be collected during the baseline and  subsequent quarterly sample periods.</p><p class="depth0">d. The sampling methodology must take measures to avoid biases in  their sampling technique. Potential sampling biases could include:  Sampling on certain days of the week but not others; sampling during  certain times of the day but not others; sampling immediately after  implementation of an ASM while the public is still going through an  adjustment period; or applying one sample method for the baseline rate  and another for the new rate.</p><p class="depth0">e. The baseline violation rate should be expressed as the number of  violations per gate activations in order to normalize for unequal gate  activations during subsequent data collection periods.</p><p class="depth0">f. All subsequent quarterly violation rate calculations must use the  same methodology as stated in this paragraph unless FRA authorizes  another methodology.</p><p class="depth0">2. The ASM should then be initiated for each crossing. Train horns  are still being sounded during this time period.</p><p class="depth0">3. In the calendar quarter following initiation of the ASM,  determine a new quarterly violation rate using the same methodology as  in paragraph (1) above.</p><p class="depth0">4. Determine the violation rate reduction for each crossing by the  following formula:  Violation rate reduction = (new rate - baseline rate)/baseline rate</p><p class="depth0">5. Determine the effectiveness rate of the ASM for each crossing by  multiplying the violation rate reduction by .78.</p><p class="depth0">6. Using the effectiveness rates for each grade crossing treated by  an ASM, determine the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If and when the Quiet Zone  Risk Index for the proposed quiet zone has been reduced to a level at,  or below, the Risk Index With Horns or the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold, the public authority may apply to FRA for approval of the  proposed quiet zone. Upon receiving written approval of the quiet zone  application from FRA, the public authority may then proceed with  notifications and implementation of the quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">7. Violation rates must be monitored for the next two calendar  quarters and every second quarter thereafter. If, after five years from  the implementation of the quiet zone, the violation rate for any quarter  has never exceeded the violation rate that was used to determine the  effectiveness rate that was approved by FRA, violation rates may be  monitored for one quarter per year.</p><p class="depth0">8. In the event that the violation rate is ever greater than the  violation rate used to determine the effectiveness rate that was  approved by FRA, the public authority may continue the quiet zone for  another quarter. If, in the second quarter the violation rate is still  greater than the rate used to determine the effectiveness rate that was  approved by FRA, a new effectiveness rate must be calculated and the  Quiet Zone Risk Index re-calculated using the new effectiveness rate. If  the new Quiet Zone Risk Index indicates that the ASM no longer fully  compensates for the lack of a train horn, or that the risk level is  equal to, or exceeds the National Significant Risk Threshold, the  procedures for dealing with unacceptable effectiveness after  establishment of a quiet zone should be followed.</p><p class="depth0">III. Engineering ASMs</p><p class="depth0">A. Engineering improvements, other than modified SSMs, may be used  in the creation of a Quiet Zone. These engineering improvements, which  will be treated as ASMs under this appendix, may include improvements  that address underlying geometric conditions, including sight distance,  that are the source of increased risk at the crossing.</p><p class="depth0">B. The effectiveness of an Engineering ASM will be determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">1. Establish the quarterly (three months) baseline violation rate  for the crossing at which the Engineering ASM will be applied.</p><p class="depth0">a. A violation in this context refers to a motorist not complying  with the automatic warning devices at the crossing (not stopping for the  flashing lights and driving over the crossing after the gate arms have  started to descend, or driving around the lowered gate arms). A  violation does not have to result in a traffic citation for the  violation to be considered.</p><p class="depth0">b. Violation data may be obtained by any method that can be shown to  provide a statistically valid sample. This may include the use of video  cameras, other technologies (e.g. inductive loops), or manual  observations that capture driver behavior when the automatic warning  devices are operating.</p><p class="depth0">c. If data is not collected continuously during the quarter,  sufficient detail must be provided in the application in order to  validate that the methodology used results in a statistically valid  sample. FRA recommends that at least a minimum of 600 samples (one  sample equals one gate activation) be collected during the baseline and  subsequent quarterly sample periods.</p><p class="depth0">d. The sampling methodology must take measures to avoid biases in  their sampling technique. Potential sampling biases could include:  Sampling on certain days of the week but not others; sampling during  certain times of the day but not others; sampling immediately after  implementation of an ASM while the public is still going through an  adjustment period; or applying one sample method for the baseline rate  and another for the new rate.</p><p class="depth0">e. The baseline violation rate should be expressed as the number of  violations per gate activations in order to normalize for unequal gate  activations during subsequent data collection periods.</p><p class="depth0">f. All subsequent quarterly violation rate calculations must use the  same methodology as stated in this paragraph unless FRA authorizes  another methodology.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Engineering ASM should be initiated at the crossing. Train  horns are still being sounded during this time period.</p><p class="depth0">3. In the calendar quarter following initiation of the Engineering  ASM, determine a new quarterly violation rate using the same methodology  as in paragraph (1) above.</p><p class="depth0">4. Determine the violation rate reduction for the crossing by the  following formula:  Violation rate reduction = (new rate - baseline rate)/baseline rate</p><p class="depth0">5. Using the Engineering ASM effectiveness rate, determine the Quiet  Zone Risk Index. If and when the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the proposed  quiet zone has been reduced to a risk level at or below the Risk Index  With Horns or the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, the public  authority may apply to FRA for approval of the quiet zone. Upon  receiving written approval of the quiet zone application from FRA, the  public authority may then proceed with notifications and implementation  of the quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">6. Violation rates must be monitored for the next two calendar  quarters. Unless otherwise provided in FRA's notification of quiet zone  approval, if the violation rate for these two calendar quarters does not  exceed   the violation rate that was used to determine the effectiveness rate  that was approved by FRA, the public authority can cease violation rate  monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">7. In the event that the violation rate over either of the next two  calendar quarters are greater than the violation rate used to determine  the effectiveness rate that was approved by FRA, the public authority  may continue the quiet zone for a third calendar quarter. However, if  the third calendar quarter violation rate is also greater than the rate  used to determine the effectiveness rate that was approved by FRA, a new  effectiveness rate must be calculated and the Quiet Zone Risk Index re- calculated using the new effectiveness rate. If the new Quiet Zone Risk  Index exceeds the Risk Index With Horns and the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold, the procedures for dealing with unacceptable  effectiveness after establishment of a quiet zone should be followed.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix C to Part 222--Guide to Establishing Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">Introduction</p><p class="depth0">This Guide to Establishing Quiet Zones (Guide) is divided into five  sections in order to address the variety of methods and conditions that  affect the establishment of quiet zones under this rule.</p><p class="depth0">Section I of the Guide provides an overview of the different ways in  which a quiet zone may be established under this rule. This includes a  brief discussion on the safety thresholds that must be attained in order  for train horns to be silenced and the relative merits of each. It also  includes the two general methods that may be used to reduce risk in the  proposed quiet zone, and the different impacts that the methods have on  the quiet zone implementation process. This section also discusses  Partial (e.g. night time only quiet zones) and Intermediate Quiet Zones.  An Intermediate Quiet Zone is one where horn restrictions were in place  after October 9, 1996, but as of December 18, 2003.</p><p class="depth0">Section II of the Guide provides information on establishing New  Quiet Zones. A New Quiet Zone is one at which train horns are currently  being sounded at crossings. The Public Authority Designation and Public  Authority Application to FRA methods will be discussed in depth.</p><p class="depth0">Section III of the Guide provides information on establishing Pre- Rule Quiet Zones. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone is one where train horns were  not routinely sounded as of October 9, 1996 and December 18, 2003. The  differences between New and Pre-Rule Quiet Zones will be explained.  Public Authority Designation and Public Authority Application to FRA  methods also apply to Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.</p><p class="depth0">Section IV of the Guide deals with the required notifications that  must be provided by public authorities when establishing both New and  continuing Pre-Rule or Intermediate Quiet Zones.</p><p class="depth0">Section V of the Guide provides examples of quiet zone  implementation.</p><p class="depth0">Section I--Overview</p><p class="depth0">In order for a quiet zone to be qualified under this rule, it must  be shown that the lack of the train horn does not present a significant  risk with respect to loss of life or serious personal injury, or that  the significant risk has been compensated for by other means. The rule  provides four basic ways in which a quiet zone may be established.  Creation of both New Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Quiet Zones are based on  the same general guidelines; however, there are a number of differences  that will be noted in the discussion on Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.</p><p class="depth0">A. Qualifying Conditions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> One of the following four conditions or scenarios must be met in  order to show that the lack of the train horn does not present a  significant risk, or that the significant risk has been compensated for  by other means:</p><p class="depth0">a. One or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at  each public crossing in the quiet zone; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold without implementation of  additional safety measures at any crossings in the quiet zone; or</p><p class="depth0">c. Additional safety measures are implemented at selected crossings  resulting in the Quiet Zone Risk Index being reduced to a level equal  to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold; or</p><p class="depth0">d. Additional safety measures are taken at selected crossings  resulting in the Quiet Zone Risk Index being reduced to at least the  level of the Risk Index With Horns (that is, the risk that would exist  if train horns were sounded at every public crossing in the quiet zone).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is important to consider the implications of each approach  before deciding which one to use. If a quiet zone is qualified based on  reference to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (i.e. the Quiet  Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold--see the second and third scenarios above), then an  annual review will be done by FRA to determine if the Quiet Zone Risk  Index remains equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold. Since the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet  Zone Risk Index may change from year to year, there is no guarantee that  the quiet zone will remain qualified. The circumstances that cause the  disqualification   may not be subject to the control of the public authority. For example,  an overall national improvement in safety at gated crossings may cause  the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold to fall. This may cause the  Quiet Zone Risk Index to become greater than the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold. If the quiet zone is no longer qualified, then the  public authority will have to take additional measures, and may incur  additional costs that might not have been budgeted, to once again lower  the Quiet Zone Risk Index to at least the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold in order to retain the quiet zone. Therefore, while the  initial cost to implement a quiet zone under the second or third  scenario may be lower than the other options, these scenarios also carry  a degree of uncertainty about the quiet zone's continued existence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The use of the first or fourth scenarios reduces the risk level  to at least the level that would exist if train horns were sounding in  the quiet zone. These methods may have higher initial costs because more  safety measures may be necessary in order to achieve the needed risk  reduction. Despite the possibility of greater initial costs, there are  several benefits to these methods. The installation of SSMs at every  crossing will provide the greatest safety benefit of any of the methods  that may be used to initiate a quiet zone. With both of these methods  (first and fourth scenarios), the public authority will never need to be  concerned about the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, annual  reviews of the Quiet Zone Risk Index, or failing to be qualified because  the Quiet Zone Risk Index is higher than the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold. Public authorities are strongly encouraged to carefully  consider both the pros and cons of all of the methods and to choose the  method that will best meet the needs of its citizens by providing a  safer and quieter community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the purposes of this Guide, the term ``Risk Index with  Horns'' is used to represent the level of risk that would exist if train  horns were sounded at every public crossing in the proposed quiet zone.  If a public authority decides that it would like to fully compensate for  the lack of a train horn and not install SSMs at each public crossing in  the quiet zone, it must reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level that  is equal to, or less than, the Risk Index with Horns. The Risk Index  with Horns is similar to the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold in  that both are targets that must be reached in order to establish a quiet  zone under the rule. Quiet zones that are established by reducing the  Quiet Zone Risk Index to at least the level of the Nationwide  Significant Risk Threshold will be reviewed annually by FRA to determine  if they still qualify under the rule to retain the quiet zone. Quiet  zones that are established by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index to at  least the level of the Risk Index with Horns will not be subject to  annual reviews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The use of FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator is recommended  to aid in the decision making process (http://www.fra.dot.gov/us/ content/1337). The Quiet Zone Calculator will allow the public authority  to consider a variety of options in determining which SSMs make the most  sense. It will also perform the necessary calculations used to determine  the existing risk level and whether enough risk has been mitigated in  order to create a quiet zone under this rule.</p><p class="depth0">B. Risk Reduction Methods</p><p class="depth0">FRA has established two general methods to reduce risk in order to  have a quiet zone qualify under this rule. The method chosen impacts the  manner in which the quiet zone is implemented.</p><p class="depth0">1. Public Authority Designation (SSMs)--The Public Authority  Designation method (Sec. 222.39(a)) involves the use of SSMs (see  appendix A) at some or all crossings within the quiet zone. The use of  only SSMs to reduce risk will allow a public authority to designate a  quiet zone without approval from FRA. If the public authority installs  SSMs at every crossing within the quiet zone, it need not demonstrate  that they will reduce the risk sufficiently in order to qualify under  the rule since FRA has already assessed the ability of the SSMs to  reduce risk. In other words, the Quiet Zone Calculator does not need to  be used. However, if only SSMs are installed within the quiet zone, but  not at every crossing, the public authority must calculate that  sufficient risk reduction will be accomplished by the SSMs. Once the  improvements are made, the public authority must make the required  notifications (which includes a copy of the report generated by the  Quiet Zone Calculator showing that the risk in the quiet zone has been  sufficiently reduced), and the quiet zone may be implemented. FRA does  not need to approve the plan as it has already assessed the ability of  the SSMs to reduce risk.</p><p class="depth0">2. Public Authority Application to FRA (ASMs)--The Public Authority  Application to FRA method (Sec. 222.39(b)) involves the use ASMs (see  appendix B). ASMs include modified SSMs that do not fully comply with  the provisions found in appendix A (e.g., shorter than required traffic  channelization devices), non-engineering ASMs (e.g., programmed law  enforcement), and engineering ASMs (i.e., engineering improvements other  than modified SSMs). If the use of ASMs (or a combination of ASMs and  SSMs) is elected to reduce risk, then the public authority must provide  a Notice of Intent and then apply to FRA for approval of the quiet zone.  The application must contain sufficient data and analysis to confirm  that the proposed ASMs do indeed provide the necessary risk   reduction. FRA will review the application and will issue a formal  approval if it determines that risk is reduced to a level that is  necessary in order to comply with the rule. Once FRA approval has been  received and the safety measures fully implemented, the public authority  would then provide a Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment and the quiet  zone may be implemented. The use of non-engineering ASMs will require  continued monitoring and analysis throughout the existence of the quiet  zone to ensure that risk continues to be reduced.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculating Risk Reduction--The following should be noted when  calculating risk reductions in association with the establishment of a  quiet zone. This information pertains to both New Quiet Zones and Pre- Rule Quiet Zones and to the Public Authority Designation and Public  Authority Application to FRA methods.</p><p class="depth0">Crossing closures: If any public crossing within the quiet zone is  proposed to be closed, include that crossing when calculating the Risk  Index with Horns. The effectiveness of a closure is 1.0. However, be  sure to increase the traffic counts at other crossings within the quiet  zone and recalculate the risk indices for those crossings that will  handle the traffic diverted from the closed crossing. It should be noted  that crossing closures that are already in existence are not considered  in the risk calculations.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A proposed New Quiet Zone contains four crossings: A, B, C  and D streets. A, B and D streets are equipped with flashing lights and  gates. C Street is a passive crossbuck crossing with a traffic count of  400 vehicles per day. It is decided that C Street will be closed as part  of the project. Compute the risk indices for all four streets. The  calculation for C Street will utilize flashing lights and gates as the  warning device. Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk Index by averaging  the risk indices for all four of the crossings. This value will also be  the Risk Index with Horns since train horns are currently being sounded.  To calculate the Quiet Zone Risk Index, first re-calculate the risk  indices for B and D streets by increasing the traffic count for each  crossing by 200. (Assume for this example that the public authority  decided that the traffic from C Street would be equally divided between  B and D streets.) Increase the risk indices for A, B and D streets by  66.8% and divide the sum of the three remaining crossings by four. This  is the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index and accounts for the risk reduction  caused by closing C Street.</p><p class="depth0">Grade Separation: Grade separated crossings that were in existence  before the creation of a quiet zone are not included in any of the  calculations. However, any public crossings within the quiet zone that  are proposed to be treated by grade separation should be treated in the  same manner as crossing closures. Highway traffic that may be diverted  from other crossings within the quiet zone to the new grade separated  crossing should be considered when computing the Quiet Zone Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A proposed New Quiet Zone contains four crossings: A, B, C  and D streets. All streets are equipped with flashing lights and gates.  C Street is a busy crossing with a traffic count of 25,000 vehicles per  day. It is decided that C Street will be grade separated as part of the  project and the existing at-grade crossing closed. Compute the risk  indices for all four streets. Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk  Index, which will also be the Risk Index with Horns, by averaging the  risk indices for all four of the crossings. To calculate the Quiet Zone  Risk Index, first re-calculate the risk indices for B and D streets by  decreasing the traffic count for each crossing by 1,200. (The public  authority decided that 2,400 motorists will decide to use the grade  separation at C Street in order to avoid possible delays caused by  passing trains.) Increase the risk indices for A, B and D streets by  66.8% and divide the sum of the three remaining crossings by four. This  is the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index and accounts for the risk reduction  caused by the grade separation at C Street.</p><p class="depth0">Pre-Existing SSMs: Risk reduction credit may be taken by a public  authority for a SSM that was previously implemented and is currently in  place in the quiet zone. If an existing improvement meets the criteria  for a SSM as provided in appendix A, the improvement is deemed a Pre- Existing SSM. Risk reduction credit is obtained by inflating the Risk  Index With Horns to show what the risk would have been at the crossing  if the pre-existing SSM had not been implemented. Crossing closures and  grade separations that occurred prior to the implementation of the quiet  zone are not Pre-Existing SSMs and do not receive any risk reduction  credit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A proposed New Quiet Zone has one crossing that is  equipped with flashing lights and gates and has medians 100 feet in  length on both sides of the crossing. The medians conform to the  requirements in appendix A and qualify as a Pre-Existing SSM. The risk  index as calculated for the crossing is 10,000. To calculate the Risk  Index With Horns for this crossing, you divide the risk index by  difference between one and the effectiveness rate of the pre-existing  SSM (10,000 / (1-0.75) = 40,000). This value (40,000) would then be  averaged in with the risk indices of the other crossings to determine  the proposed quiet zone's Risk Index With Horns. To calculate the Quiet  Zone Risk Index, the original risk index is increased by 66.8% to  account for the additional risk attributed to the absence of the train  horn (10,000 x 1.668 = 16,680). This value (16,680) is then averaged   into the risk indices of the other crossings that have also been  increased by 66.8%. The resulting average is the Quiet Zone Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone consisting of four crossings has  one crossing that is equipped with flashing lights and gates and has  medians 100 feet in length on both sides of the crossing. The medians  conform to the requirements in appendix A and qualify as a Pre-Existing  SSM. The risk index as calculated for the crossing is 20,000. To  calculate the Risk Index With Horns for this crossing, first reduce the  risk index by 40 percent to reflect the risk reduction that would be  achieved if train horns were routinely sounded (20,000 x 0.6 = 12,000).  Next, divide the resulting risk index by difference between one and the  effectiveness rate of the pre-existing SSM (12,000 / (1 - 0.75) =  48,000). This value (48,000) would then be averaged with the adjusted  risk indices of the other crossings to determine the pre-rule quiet  zone's Risk Index With Horns. To calculate the Quiet Zone Risk Index,  the original risk index (20,000) is then averaged into the risk original  indices of the other crossings. The resulting average is the Quiet Zone  Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0">Pre-Existing Modified SSMs: Risk reduction credit may be taken by a  public authority for a modified SSM that was previously implemented and  is currently in place in the quiet zone. Modified SSMs are Alternative  Safety Measures which must be approved by FRA. If an existing  improvement is approved by FRA as a modified SSM as provided in appendix  B, the improvement is deemed a Pre-Existing Modified SSM. Risk reduction  credit is obtained by inflating the Risk Index With Horns to show what  the risk would have been at the crossing if the pre-existing SSM had not  been implemented. The effectiveness rate of the modified SSM will be  determined by FRA. The public authority may provide information to FRA  to be used in determining the effectiveness rate of the modified SSM.  Once an effectiveness rate has been determined, follow the procedure  previously discussed for Pre-Existing SSMs to determine the risk values  that will be used in the quiet zone calculations.</p><p class="depth0">Wayside Horns: Crossings with wayside horn installations will be  treated as a one for one substitute for the train horn and are not to be  included when calculating the Crossing Corridor Risk Index, the Risk  Index with Horns or the Quiet Zone Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0">Example: A proposed New Quiet Zone contains four crossings: A, B, C  and D streets. All streets are equipped with flashing lights and gates.  It is decided that C Street will have a wayside horn installed. Compute  the risk indices for A, B and D streets. Since C Street is being treated  with a wayside horn, it is not included in the calculation of risk.  Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk Index by averaging the risk indices  for A, B and D streets. This value is also the Risk Index with Horns.  Increase the risk indices for A, B and D streets by 66.8% and average  the results. This is the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index for the proposed  quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">C. Partial Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">A Partial Quiet Zone is a quiet zone in which locomotive horns are  not routinely sounded at public crossings for a specified period of time  each day. For example, a quiet zone during only the nighttime hours  would be a partial quiet zone. Partial quiet zones may be either New or  Pre-Rule and follow the same rules as 24 hour quiet zones. New Partial  Quiet Zones must be in effect during the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. All  New Partial Quiet Zones must comply with all of the requirements for New  Quiet Zones. For example, all public grade crossings that are open  during the time that horns are silenced must be equipped with flashing  lights and gates that are equipped with constant warning time (where  practical) and power out indicators. Risk is calculated in exactly the  same manner as for New Quiet Zones. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is  calculated for the entire 24-hour period, even though the train horn  will only be silenced during the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.</p><p class="depth0">A Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone is a partial quiet zone at which train  horns were not sounding as of October 9, 1996 and on December 18, 2003.  All of the regulations that pertain to Pre-Rule Quiet Zones also pertain  to Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is calculated  for the entire 24-hour period for Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones, even  though train horns are only silenced during the nighttime hours. Pre- Rule Partial Quiet Zones may qualify for automatic approval in the same  manner as Pre-Rule Quiet Zones with one exception. If the Quiet Zone  Risk Index is less than twice the National Significant Risk Threshold,  and there have been no relevant collisions during the time period when  train horns are silenced, then the Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone is  automatically qualified. In other words, a relevant collision that  occurred during the period of time that train horns were sounded will  not disqualify a Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone that has a Quiet Zone Risk  Index that is less than twice the National Significant Risk Index. Pre- Rule Partial Quiet Zones must provide the notification as required in  Sec. 222.43 in order to keep train horns silenced. A Pre-Rule Partial  Quiet Zone may be converted to a 24 hour New Quiet Zone by complying  with all of the New Quiet Zone regulations.</p><p class="depth0">D. Intermediate Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">An Intermediate Quiet Zone is one where horn restrictions were in  place after October 9, 1996, but as of December 18, 2003 (the  publication date of the Interim Final Rule). Intermediate Quiet Zones  and Intermediate Partial Quiet Zones will be able to keep train horns  silenced until June 24, 2006, provided notification is made per  Sec. 222.43. This will enable public authority to have additional time  to make the improvement necessary to come into compliance with the rule.  Intermediate Quiet Zones must conform to all the requirements for New  Quiet Zones by June 24, 2006. Other than having the horn silenced for an  additional year, Intermediate Quiet Zones are treated exactly like New  Quiet Zones.</p><p class="depth0">Section II--New Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">FRA has established several approaches that may be taken in order to  establish a New Quiet Zone under this rule. Please see the preceding  discussions on ``Qualifying Conditions'' and ``Risk Reduction Methods''  to assist in the decision-making process on which approach to take. This  following discussion provides the steps necessary to establish New Quiet  Zones and includes both the Public Authority Designation and Public  Authority Application to FRA methods. It must be remembered that in a  New Quiet Zone all public crossings must be equipped with flashing  lights and gates. The requirements are the same regardless of whether a  24-hour or partial quiet zone is being created.</p><p class="depth0">A. Requirements for Both Public Authority Designation and Public</p><p class="depth0">Authority Application</p><p class="depth0">The following steps are necessary when establishing a New Quiet  Zone. This information pertains to both the Public Authority Designation  and Public Authority Application to FRA methods.</p><p class="depth0">1. The public authority must provide a written Notice of Intent  (Sec. 222.43(a)(1) and Sec. 222.43(b)) to the railroads that operate  over the proposed quiet zone, the State agency responsible for highway  and road safety and the State agency responsible for grade crossing  safety. The purpose of this Notice of Intent is to provide an  opportunity for the railroads and the State agencies to provide comments  and recommendations to the public authority as it is planning the quiet  zone. They will have 60 days to provide these comments to the public  authority. The quiet zone cannot be created unless the Notice of Intent  has been provided. FRA encourages public authorities to provide the  required Notice of Intent early in the quiet zone development process.  The railroads and State agencies can provide an expertise that very well  may not be present within the public authority. FRA believes that it  will be very useful to include these organizations in the planning  process. For example, including railroads and State agencies in the  inspections of the crossing will help ensure accurate Inventory  information for the crossings. The railroad can provide information on  whether the flashing lights and gates are equipped with constant warning  time and power out indicators. Pedestrian crossings and private  crossings with public access, industrial or commercial use that are  within the quiet zone must have a diagnostic team review and be treated  according to the team's recommendations. Railroads and the State agency  responsible for grade crossing safety must be invited to the diagnostic  team review. Note: Please see Section IV for details on the requirements  of a Notice of Intent.</p><p class="depth0">2. Determine all public, private and pedestrian at-grade crossings  that will be included within the quiet zone. Also, determine any  existing grade-separated crossings that fall within the quiet zone. Each  crossing must be identified by the U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory number  and street or highway name. If a crossing does not have a U.S. DOT  Crossing Inventory number, then contact FRA's Office of Safety (202-493- 6299) for assistance.</p><p class="depth0">3. Ensure that the quiet zone will be at least one-half mile in  length. (Sec. 222.35(a)(1)) If more than one New Quiet Zone or New  Partial Quiet Zone will be created within a single political  jurisdiction, ensure that each New Quiet Zone or New Partial Quiet Zone  will be separated by at least one public highway-rail grade crossing.  (Sec. 222.35(a)(1)(iii))</p><p class="depth0">4. A complete and accurate Grade Crossing Inventory Form must be on  file with FRA for all crossings (public, private and pedestrian) within  the quiet zone. An inspection of each crossing in the proposed quiet  zone should be performed and the Grade Crossing Inventory Forms updated,  as necessary, to reflect the current conditions at each crossing.</p><p class="depth0">5. Every public crossing within the quiet zone must be equipped with  active warning devices comprising both flashing lights and gates. The  warning devices must be equipped with power out indicators. Constant  warning time circuitry is also required unless existing conditions would  prevent the proper operation of the constant warning time circuitry. FRA  recommends that these automatic warning devices also be equipped with at  least one bell to provide an audible warning to pedestrians. If the  warning devices are already equipped with a bell (or bells), the bells  may not be removed or deactivated. The plans for the quiet zone may be  made assuming that flashing lights and gates are at all public  crossings; however the quiet zone may not be implemented until all  public crossings are actually equipped with the flashing lights and  gates. (Secs. 222.35(b)(1) and 222.35(b)(2))</p><p class="depth0">6. Private crossings must have cross-bucks and ``STOP'' signs on  both approaches to the crossing. Private crossings with public access,  industrial or commercial use must have a diagnostic team review and be  treated according to the team's recommendations. The public authority  must invite the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety and  all affected railroads to participate in the diagnostic review.  (Secs. 222.25(b) and (c))</p><p class="depth0">7. Each highway approach to every public and private crossing must  have an advance warning sign (in accordance with the MUTCD) that advises  motorists that train horns are not sounded at the crossing, unless the  public or private crossing is equipped with a wayside horn.  (Sec. 222.35(c))</p><p class="depth0">8. Each pedestrian crossing must be reviewed by a diagnostic team  and equipped or treated in accordance with the recommendation of the  diagnostic team. The public authority must invite the State agency  responsible for grade crossing safety and all affected railroads to  participate in the diagnostic review. At a minimum, each approach to  every pedestrian crossing must be equipped with a sign that conforms to  the MUTCD and advises pedestrians that train horns are not sounded at  the crossing. (Sec. 222.27)</p><p class="depth0">B. New Quiet Zones--Public Authority Designation</p><p class="depth0">Once again it should be remembered that all public crossings must be  equipped with automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights  and gates in accordance with Sec. 222.35(b). In addition, one of the  following conditions must be met in order for a public authority to  designate a new quiet zone without FRA approval:</p><p class="depth0">a. One or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at  each public crossing in the quiet zone (Sec. 222.39(a)(1)); or</p><p class="depth0">b. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold without SSMs installed at any  crossings in the quiet zone (Sec. 222.39(a)(2)(i)); or</p><p class="depth0">c. SSMs are installed at selected crossings, resulting in the Quiet  Zone Risk Index being reduced to a level equal to, or less than, the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (Sec. 222.39(a)(2)(ii)); or</p><p class="depth0">d. SSMs are installed at selected crossings, resulting in the Quiet  Zone Risk Index being reduced to a level of risk that would exist if the  horn were sounded at every crossing in the quiet zone (i.e., the Risk  Index with Horns) (Sec. 222.39(a)(3)).</p><p class="depth0">Steps necessary to establish a New Quiet Zone using the Public  Authority Application to FRA method:</p><p class="depth0">1. If one or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at  each public crossing in the quiet zone, the requirements for a public  authority designation quiet zone will have been met. It is not necessary  for the same SSM to be used at each crossing. However, before any  improvements are implemented, the public authority must provide a Notice  of Intent, which will trigger a 60-day comment period. During the 60-day  comment period, railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone and  State agencies responsible for grade crossing, highway and road safety  may submit comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements to the  public authority. Once the necessary improvements have been installed,  Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment shall be provided and the quiet zone  implemented in accordance with the rule. If SSMs are not installed at  each public crossing, proceed on to Step 2 and use the risk reduction  method.</p><p class="depth0">2. To begin, calculate the risk index for each public crossing  within the quiet zone (See appendix D. FRA's web-based Quiet Zone  Calculator may be used to do this calculation). If flashing lights and  gates have to be installed at any public crossings, calculate the risk  indices for such crossings as if lights and gates were installed. (Note:  Flashing lights and gates must be installed prior to initiation of the  quiet zone.) If the Inventory record does not reflect the actual  conditions at the crossing, be sure to use the conditions that currently  exist when calculating the risk index. Note: Private crossings and  pedestrian crossings are not included when computing the risk for the  proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">3. The Crossing Corridor Risk Index is then calculated by averaging  the risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone.  Since train horns are routinely being sounded for crossings in the  proposed quiet zone, this value is also the Risk Index with Horns.</p><p class="depth0">4. In order to calculate the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index, first  adjust the risk index at each public crossing to account for the  increased risk due to the absence of the train horn. The absence of the  horn is reflected by an increased risk index of 66.8% at gated  crossings. The initial Quiet Zone Risk Index is then calculated by  averaging the increased risk index for each public crossing within the  proposed quiet zone. At this point the Quiet Zone Risk Index will equal  the Risk Index with Horns multiplied by 1.668.</p><p class="depth0">5. Compare the Quiet Zone Risk Index to the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than,  the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, then the public authority may  decide to designate a quiet zone and provide the Notice of Intent,  followed by the Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment. With this approach,  FRA will annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold  and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the  quiet zone rises above the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA   will notify the Public Authority so that appropriate measures can be  taken. (See Sec. 222.51(a)).</p><p class="depth0">6. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is greater than the Nationwide  Significant Risk Threshold, then select an appropriate SSM for a  crossing. Reduce the inflated risk index calculated in Step 4 for that  crossing by the effectiveness rate of the chosen SSM. (See appendix A  for the effectiveness rates for the various SSMs). Recalculate the Quiet  Zone Risk Index by averaging the revised inflated risk index with the  inflated risk indices for the other public crossings. If this new Quiet  Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold, the quiet zone would qualify for public authority  designation. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is still higher than the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, treat another public crossing  with an appropriate SSM and repeat the process until the Quiet Zone Risk  Index is equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold. Once this result is obtained, the quiet zone will qualify for  establishment by public authority designation. Early in the quiet zone  development process, a Notice of Intent should be provided by the public  authority, which will trigger a 60-day comment period. During this 60- day comment period, railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone  and State agencies responsible for grade crossing, highway and road  safety may provide comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements  described in the Notice of Intent. Once all the necessary safety  improvements have been implemented, Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment  must be provided. With this approach, FRA will annually recalculate the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If  the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone rises above the Nationwide  Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will notify the public authority so that  appropriate measures can be taken. (See Sec. 222.51(a)).</p><p class="depth0">7. If the public authority wishes to reduce the risk of the quiet  zone to the level of risk that would exist if the horn were sounded at  every crossing within the quiet zone, the public authority should  calculate the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index as in Step 4. The objective  is to now reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to the level of the Risk  Index with Horns by adding SSMs at the crossings. The difference between  the Quiet Zone Risk Index and the Risk Index with Horns is the amount of  risk that will have to be reduced in order to fully compensate for lack  of the train horn. The use of the Quiet Zone Calculator will aid in  determining which SSMs may be used to reduce the risk sufficiently.  Follow the procedure stated in Step 6, except that the Quiet Zone Risk  Index must be equal to, or less than, the Risk Index with Horns instead  of the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. Once this risk level is  attained, the quiet zone will qualify for establishment by public  authority designation. Early in the quiet zone development process, a  Notice of Intent should be provided by the public authority, which will  trigger a 60-day comment period. During this 60-day comment period,  railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone and State agencies  responsible for grade crossing, highway and road safety may provide  comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements described in the Notice  of Intent. Once all the necessary safety improvements have been  implemented, Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment must be provided. One  important distinction with this option is that the public authority will  never need to be concerned with the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold or the Quiet Zone Risk Index. The rule's intent is to make the  quiet zone as safe as if the train horns were sounding. If this is  accomplished, the public authority may designate the crossings as a  quiet zone and need not be concerned with possible fluctuations in the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or annual risk reviews.</p><p class="depth0">C. New Quiet Zones--Public Authority Application to FRA</p><p class="depth0">A public authority must apply to FRA for approval of a quiet zone  under three conditions. First, if any of the SSMs selected for the quiet  zone do not fully conform to the design standards set forth in appendix  A. These are referred to as modified SSMs in appendix B. Second, when  programmed law enforcement, public education and awareness programs, or  photo enforcement is used to reduce risk in the quiet zone, these are  referred to as non-engineering ASMs in appendix B. It should be  remembered that non-engineering ASMs will require periodic monitoring as  long as the quiet zone is in existence. Third, when engineering ASMs are  used to reduce risk. Please see appendix B for detailed explanations of  ASMs and the periodic monitoring of non-engineering ASMs.</p><p class="depth0">The public authority is strongly encouraged to submit the  application to FRA for review and comment before the appendix B  treatments are initiated. This will enable FRA to provide comments on  the proposed ASMs to help guide the application process. If non- engineering ASMs or engineering ASMs are proposed, the public authority  also may wish to confirm with FRA that the methodology it plans to use  to determine the effectiveness rates of the proposed ASMs is  appropriate. A quiet zone that utilizes a combination of SSMs from  appendix A and ASMs from appendix B must make a Public Authority  Application to FRA. A complete and thoroughly documented application  will help to expedite the approval process.</p><p class="depth0">The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps  necessary to establish a new quiet zone using the Public Authority  Application to FRA method. Once again it should be remembered that all  public crossings must be equipped with automatic warning devices  consisting of flashing lights and gates in accordance with  Sec. 222.35(b).</p><p class="depth0">1. Gather the information previously mentioned in the section on  ``Requirements for both Public Authority Designation and Public  Authority Application.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing as directed in  Step 2--Public Authority Designation.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculate the Crossing Corridor Risk Index, which is also the  Risk Index with Horns, as directed in Step 3--Public Authority  Designation.</p><p class="depth0">4. Calculate the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index as directed in Step  4--Public Authority Designation.</p><p class="depth0">5. Begin to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index through the use of ASMs  and SSMs. Follow the procedure provided in Step 6--Public Authority  Designation until the Quiet Zone Risk Index has been reduced to equal  to, or less than, either the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or  the Risk Index with Horns. (Remember that the public authority may  choose which level of risk reduction is the most appropriate for its  community.) Effectiveness rates for ASMs should be provided as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Modified SSMs--Estimates of effectiveness for modified SSMs may  be based upon adjustments from the effectiveness rates provided in  appendix A or from actual field data derived from the crossing sites.  The application must provide an estimated effectiveness rate and the  rationale for the estimate.</p><p class="depth0">b. Non-engineering ASMs--Effectiveness rates are to be calculated in  accordance with the provisions of appendix B, paragraph II B.</p><p class="depth0">c. Engineering ASMs--Effectiveness rates are to be calculated in  accordance with the provisions of appendix B, paragraph III B.</p><p class="depth0">6. Once it has been determined through analysis that the Quiet Zone  Risk Index will be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns, the  public authority must provide a Notice of Intent. The mailing of the  Notice of Intent will trigger a 60-day comment period, during which  railroads operating within the proposed quiet zone and State agencies  responsible for grade crossing, highway and road safety may provide  comments on the proposed quiet zone improvements. After reviewing any  comments received, the public authority may make application to FRA for  a quiet zone under Sec. 222.39(b). FRA will review the application to  determine the appropriateness of the proposed effectiveness rates, and  whether or not the proposed application demonstrates that the quiet zone  meets the requirements of the rule. When submitting the application to  FRA for approval, the application must contain the following  (Sec. 222.39(b)(1)):</p><p class="depth0">a. Sufficient detail concerning the present safety measures at all  crossings within the proposed quiet zone. This includes current and  accurate crossing inventory forms for each public, private, and  pedestrian grade crossing.</p><p class="depth0">b. Detailed information on the safety improvements that are proposed  to be implemented at public, private and pedestrian grade crossings  within the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">c. Membership and recommendations of the diagnostic team (if any)  that reviewed the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">d. Statement of efforts taken to address comments submitted by  affected railroads, the State agency responsible for grade crossing  safety, and the State agency responsible for highway and road safety,  including a list of any objections raised by the railroads or State  agencies.</p><p class="depth0">e. A commitment to implement the proposed safety measures.</p><p class="depth0">f. Demonstrate through data and analysis that the proposed measures  will reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level equal to, or less than,  either the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with  Horns.</p><p class="depth0">g. A copy of the application must be provided to: All railroads  operating over the public highway-rail grade crossings within the quiet  zone; the highway or traffic control or law enforcement authority having  jurisdiction over vehicular traffic at grade crossings within the quiet  zone; the landowner having control over any private crossings within the  quiet zone; the State agency responsible for highway and road safety;  the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety; and the  Associate Administrator. (Sec. 222.39(b)(3))</p><p class="depth0">7. Upon receiving written approval from FRA of the quiet zone  application, the public authority may then provide the Notice of Quiet  Zone Establishment and implement the quiet zone. If the quiet zone is  qualified by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index to a level at, or below,  the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will annually recalculate  the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk Index.  If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone rises above the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will notify the public  authority so that appropriate measures can be taken. (See  Sec. 222.51(a))</p><p class="depth0">Note: The provisions stated above for crossing closures, grade  separations, wayside horns, pre-existing SSMs and pre-existing   modified SSMs apply for Public Authority Application to FRA as well.</p><p class="depth0">Section III--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">Pre-Rule Quiet Zones are treated slightly differently from New Quiet  Zones in the rule. This is a reflection of the statutory requirement to  ``take into account the interest of communities that have in effect  restrictions on the sounding of a locomotive horn at highway-rail grade  crossings. * * *'' (49 U.S.C. 20153(i)) It also recognizes the  historical experience of train horns not being sounded at Pre-Rule Quiet  Zones.</p><p class="depth0">Overview</p><p class="depth0">Pre-Rule Quiet Zones that are not established by automatic approval  (see discussion that follows) must meet the same requirements as New  Quiet Zones as provided in Sec. 222.39. In other words, risk must be  reduced through the use of SSMs or ASMs so that the Quiet Zone Risk  Index for the quiet zone has been reduced to either the risk level which  would exist if locomotive horns sounded at all crossings in the quiet  zone (i.e. the Risk Index with Horns) or to a risk level equal to, or  less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold. There are four  differences in the requirements between Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and New  Quiet Zones that must be noted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> First, since train horns have not been routinely sounded in the  Pre-Rule Quiet Zone, it is not necessary to increase the risk indices of  the public crossings to reflect the additional risk caused by the lack  of a train horn. Since the train horn has already been silenced, the  added risk caused by the lack of a horn is reflected in the actual  collision history at the crossings. Collision history is an important  part in the calculation of the severity risk indices. In other words,  the Quiet Zone Risk Index is calculated by averaging the existing risk  index for each public crossing without the need to increase the risk  index by 66.8%. For Pre-Rule Quiet Zones, the Crossing Corridor Risk  Index and the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index have the same value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Second, since train horns have been silenced at the crossings,  it will be necessary to mathematically determine what the risk level  would have been at the crossings if train horns had been routinely  sounded. These revised risk levels then will be used to calculate the  Risk Index with Horns. This calculation is necessary to determine how  much risk must be eliminated in order to compensate for the lack of the  train horn. This will allow the public authority to have the choice to  reduce the risk to at least the level of the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold or to fully compensate for the lack of the train horn.</p><p class="depth0">To calculate the Risk Index with Horns, the first step is to divide  the existing severity risk index for each crossing by the appropriate  value as shown in Table 1. This process eliminates the risk that was  caused by the absence of train horns. The table takes into account that  the train horn has been found to produce different levels of  effectiveness in preventing collisions depending on the type of warning  device at the crossing. (Note: FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator  will perform this computation automatically for Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.)  The Risk Index with Horns is the average of the revised risk indices.  The difference between the calculated Risk Index with Horns and the  Quiet Zone Risk Index is the amount of risk that would have to be  reduced in order to fully compensate for the lack of train horns.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Risk Index Divisor Values ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Flashing    Lights &</p><p class="depth0">Passive     lights       gates ------------------------------------------------------------------------ U.S.................................      1.749       1.309       1.668 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3))</em>. For New Quiet Zones,  all crossings must be equipped with automatic warning devices consisting  of flashing lights and gates. Crossings without gates must have gates  installed. The severity risk index for that crossing is then calculated  to establish the risk index that is used in the Risk Index with Horns.  The Risk Index with Horns is then increased by 66.8% to adjust for the  lack of the train horn. The adjusted figure is the initial Quiet Zone  Risk Index. There is no credit received for the risk reduction that is  attributable to warning device upgrades in New Quiet Zones.</p><p class="depth0">For Pre-Rule Quiet Zones, the Risk Index with Horns is calculated  from the initial risk indices which use the warning devices that are  currently installed. If a public authority elects to upgrade an existing  warning device as part of its quiet zone plan, the accident prediction  value for that crossing will be re-calculated based on the upgraded  warning device. (Once again, FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator can  do the actual computation.) The new accident prediction value is then  used in the severity risk index formula to determine the risk index for  the crossing. This adjusted risk index is then used to compute the new  Quiet Zone Risk Index. This computation allows the risk reduction  attributed to the warning device upgrades to be used in establishing a  quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The fourth difference is that Pre-Rule Quiet Zones have  different minimum requirements under Sec. 222.35. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone  may be less than one-half mile in length if that was its length as of  October 9,   1996 (Sec. 222.35(a)(2)). A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not have to have  automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and gates at  every public crossing (Sec. 222.35(b)(3)). The existing crossing safety  warning systems in place as of December 18, 2003 may be retained but  cannot be downgraded. It also is not necessary for the automatic warning  devices to be equipped with constant warning time devices or power out  indicators; however, when the warning devices are upgraded, constant  warning time and power out indicators will be required if reasonably  practical (Sec. 222.35(b)(3)). Advance warning signs that notify the  motorist that train horns are not sounded do not have to be installed on  each approach to public, private, and pedestrian grade crossings within  the quiet zone until June 24, 2008. (Secs. 222.27(d) and 222.35(c))  Similarly, STOP signs and crossbucks do not have to be installed on each  approach to private crossings within the quiet zone until June 24, 2008.  (Sec. 222.25(c)).</p><p class="depth0">A. Requirements for Both Public Authority Designation and Public</p><p class="depth0">Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones</p><p class="depth0">The following is necessary when establishing a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone.  This information pertains to Automatic Approval, the Public Authority  Designation and Public Authority Application to FRA methods.</p><p class="depth0">1. Determine all public, private and pedestrian at-grade crossings  that will be included within the quiet zone. Also determine any existing  grade separated crossings that fall within the quiet zone. Each crossing  must be identified by the U.S. DOT Crossing Inventory number and street  name. If a crossing does not have a U.S. DOT crossing number, then  contact FRA for assistance.</p><p class="depth0">2. Document the length of the quiet zone. It is not necessary that  the quiet zone be at least one-half mile in length. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones  may be shorter than one-half mile. However, the addition of a new  crossing that is not a part of an existing Pre-Rule Quiet Zone to a  quiet zone nullifies its pre-rule status, and the resulting New Quiet  Zone must be at least one-half mile. The deletion of a crossing from a  Pre-Rule Quiet Zone (except through closure or grade separation) must  result in a quiet zone that is at least one-half mile in length. It is  the intent of the rule to allow adjacent Pre-Rule Quiet Zones to be  combined into one large pre-rule quiet zone if the respective public  authorities desire to do so. (Sec. 222.35(a)(2))</p><p class="depth0">3. A complete and accurate Grade Crossing Inventory Form must be on  file with FRA for all crossings (public, private and pedestrian) within  the quiet zone. An inspection of each crossing in the proposed quiet  zone should be performed and the Grade Crossing Inventory Forms updated,  as necessary, to reflect the current conditions at each crossing.</p><p class="depth0">4. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones must retain, and may upgrade, the existing  grade crossing safety warning systems. Unlike New Quiet Zones, it is not  necessary that every public crossing within a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone be  equipped with active warning devices comprising both flashing lights and  gates. Existing warning devices need not be equipped with power out  indicators and constant warning time circuitry. If warning devices are  upgraded to flashing lights, or flashing lights and gates, the upgraded  equipment must include, as is required for New Quiet Zones, power out  indicators and constant warning time devices (if reasonably practical).  (Sec. 222.35(b)(3))</p><p class="depth0">5. By June 24, 2008, private crossings must have cross-bucks and  ``STOP'' signs on both approaches to the crossing. (Sec. 222.25(c))</p><p class="depth0">6. By June 24, 2008, each approach to a public, private, and  pedestrian crossing must be equipped with an advance warning sign that  conforms to the MUTCD and advises pedestrians and motorists that train  horns are not sounded at the crossing. (Secs. 222.27(d), 222.35(c))</p><p class="depth0">7. It will be necessary for the public authority to provide a Notice  of Quiet Zone Continuation in order to prevent the resumption of  locomotive horn sounding when the rule becomes effective. A detailed  discussion of the requirements of Sec. 222.43(c) is provided in Section  IV of this appendix. The Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation must be  provided to the appropriate parties by all Pre-Rule Quiet Zones that  have not established quiet zones by automatic approval. This should be  done no later than June 3, 2005 to ensure that train horns will not  start being sounded on June 24, 2005. A Pre-Rule Quiet Zone may provide  a Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation before it has determined whether or  not it qualifies for automatic approval. Once it has been determined  that the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone will be established by automatic approval,  the Public Authority must provide the Notice of Quiet Zone  Establishment. This must be accomplished no later than December 24,  2005. If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone will not be established by automatic  approval, the Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation will enable the train  horns to be silenced until June 24, 2008. (Please refer to  Sec. 222.41(c) for more information.)</p><p class="depth0">B. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Automatic Approval</p><p class="depth0">In order for a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone to be established under this rule  (Sec. 222.41(a)), one of the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth0">a. One or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at  each public crossing in the quiet zone;</p><p class="depth0">b. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold;</p><p class="depth0">c. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold but   less than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and there have  been no relevant collisions at any public grade crossing within the  quiet zone for the preceding five years; or</p><p class="depth0">d. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than, the Risk  Index With Horns.</p><p class="depth0">Additionally, the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone must be in compliance with the  minimum requirements for quiet zones (Sec. 222.35) and the notification  requirements in Sec. 222.43.</p><p class="depth0">The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps  necessary to determine if a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone qualifies for automatic  approval.</p><p class="depth0">1. All of the items listed in Requirements for Both Public Authority  Designation and Public Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones  previously mentioned are to be accomplished. Remember that a Pre-Rule  Quiet Zone may be less than one-half mile in length if that was its  length as of October 9, 1996. Also, a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not have  to have automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and  gates at every public crossing.</p><p class="depth0">2. If one or more SSMs as identified in appendix A are installed at  each public crossing in the quiet zone, the quiet zone qualifies and the  public authority may provide the Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment. If  the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not qualify by this step, proceed on to the  next step.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing within the  quiet zone (See appendix D.) Be sure that the risk index is calculated  using the formula appropriate for the type of warning device that is  actually installed at the crossing. Unlike New Quiet Zones, it is not  necessary to calculate the risk index using flashing lights and gates as  the warning device at every public crossing. (FRA's web-based Quiet Zone  Calculator may be used to simplify the calculation process). If the  Inventory record does not reflect the actual conditions at the crossing,  be sure to use the conditions that currently exist when calculating the  risk index.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Quiet Zone Risk Index is then calculated by averaging the  risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone.  (Note: The initial Quiet Zone Risk Index and the Crossing Corridor Risk  Index are the same for Pre-Rule Quiet Zones.)</p><p class="depth0">5. Compare the Quiet Zone Risk Index to the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is equal to, or less than,  the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, then the quiet zone  qualifies, and the public authority may provide the Notice of Quiet Zone  Establishment. With this approach, FRA will annually recalculate the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk. If the  Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone is found to be above the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, FRA will notify the public  authority so that appropriate measures can be taken (See  Sec. 222.51(b)). If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone is not established by this  step, proceed on to the next step.</p><p class="depth0">6. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant  Risk Threshold but less than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold and there have been no relevant collisions at any public grade  crossing within the quiet zone for the preceding five years, then the  quiet zone qualifies for automatic approval. However, in order to  qualify on this basis, the public authority must provide a Notice of  Quiet Zone Establishment by December 24, 2005. (Note: A relevant  collision means a collision at a highway-rail grade crossing between a  train and a motor vehicle, excluding the following: a collision  resulting from an activation failure of an active grade crossing warning  system; a collision in which there is no driver in the motor vehicle; or  a collision where the highway vehicle struck the side of the train  beyond the fourth locomotive unit or rail car.) With this approach, FRA  will annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and  the Quiet Zone Risk. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone is  above two times the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, or a relevant  collision has occurred during the preceding year, FRA will notify the  public authority so that appropriate measures can be taken (See  Sec. 222.51(b)).</p><p class="depth0">If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone is not established by automatic approval,  continuation of the quiet zone may require implementation of SSMs or  ASMs to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index for the quiet zone to a risk  level equal to, or below, either the risk level which would exist if  locomotive horns sounded at all crossings in the quiet zone (i.e. the  Risk Index with Horns) or the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold.  This is the same methodology used to create New Quiet Zones with the  exception of the four differences previously noted. A review of the  previous discussion on the two methods used to establish quiet zones may  prove helpful in determining which would be the most beneficial to use  for a particular Pre-Rule Quiet Zone.</p><p class="depth0">C. Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Public Authority Designation</p><p class="depth0">The following discussion is meant to provide guidance on the steps  necessary to establish a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone using the Public Authority  Designation method.</p><p class="depth0">1. The public authority must provide a Notice of Intent  (Secs. 222.43(a)(1) and 222.43(b)) to the railroads that operate within  the proposed quiet zone, the State agency responsible for highway and  road safety and the State agency responsible for grade crossing safety.  This notice must be mailed by February 24, 2008, in order to continue  existing locomotive horn restrictions beyond June 24, 2008 without  interruption. The purpose of   this Notice of Intent is to provide an opportunity for the railroads and  the State agencies to provide comments and recommendations to the public  authority as it is planning the quiet zone. They will have 60 days to  provide these comments to the public authority. The Notice of Intent  must be provided, if new SSMs or ASMs will be implemented within the  quiet zone. FRA encourages public authorities to provide the required  Notice of Intent early in the quiet zone development process. The  railroads and State agencies can provide an expertise that very well may  not be present within the public authority. FRA believes that it will be  very useful to include these organizations in the planning process. For  example, including them in the inspections of the crossing will help  ensure accurate Inventory information for the crossings. Note: Please  see Section IV for details on the requirements of a Notice of Intent.</p><p class="depth0">2. All of the items listed in ``Requirements for Both Public  Authority Designation and Public Authority Application--Pre-Rule Quiet  Zones'' previously mentioned are to be accomplished. Remember that a  Pre-Rule Quiet Zone may be less than one-half mile in length if that was  its length as of October 9, 1996. Also, a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone does not  have to have automatic warning devices consisting of flashing lights and  gates at every public crossing.</p><p class="depth0">3. Calculate the risk index for each public crossing within the  quiet zone as in Step 3--Pre-Rule Quiet Zones--Automatic Approval.</p><p class="depth0">4. The Crossing Corridor Risk Index is then calculated by averaging  the risk index for each public crossing within the proposed quiet zone.  Since train horns are not being sounded for crossings, this value is  actually the initial Quiet Zone Risk Index.</p><p class="depth0">5. Calculate Risk Index with Horns by the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. For each public crossing, divide the risk index that was  calculated in Step 2 by the appropriate value in Table 1. This produces  the risk index that would have existed had the train horn been sounded.</p><p class="depth0">b. Average these reduced risk indices together. The resulting  average is the Risk Index with Horns.</p><p class="depth0">6. Begin to reduce the Quiet Zone Risk Index through the use of SSMs  or by upgrading existing warning devices. Follow the procedure provided  in Step 6--Public Authority Designation until the Quiet Zone Risk Index  has been reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns. A  public authority may elect to upgrade an existing warning device as part  of its Pre-Rule Quiet Zone plan. When upgrading a warning device, the  accident prediction value for that crossing must be re-calculated for  the new warning device. Determine the new risk index for the upgraded  crossing by using the new accident prediction value in the severity risk  index formula. This new risk index is then used to compute the new Quiet  Zone Risk Index. (Remember that FRA's web-based Quiet Zone Calculator  will be able to do the actual computations.) Once the Quiet Zone Risk  Index has been reduced to a level equal to, or less than, either the  Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold or the Risk Index with Horns, the  quiet zone may be established by the Public Authority Designation  method, and the public authority may provide the Notice of Quiet Zone  Establishment once all the necessary improvements have been installed.  If the quiet zone is established by reducing the Quiet Zone Risk Index  to a risk level equal to, or less than, the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold, FRA will annually recalculate the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold and the Quiet Zone Risk Index. If the Quiet Zone Risk Index  for the quiet zone rises above the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold, FRA will notify the public authority so that appropriate  measures can be taken (See Sec. 222.51(b)).</p><p class="depth0">7. If the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone will not be established before June  24, 2008, the public authority must file a detailed plan for quiet zone  improvements with the Associate Administrator by June 24, 2008. By  providing a Notice of Intent (see Step 1 above) and a detailed plan for  quiet zone improvements, existing locomotive horn restrictions may  continue until June 24, 2010. (If a comprehensive State-wide  implementation plan and funding commitment are also provided and safety  improvements are initiated within at least one Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or  Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone, existing locomotive horn restrictions may  continue until June 24, 2013.) (See Sec. 222.41(c) for more  information.)</p><p class="depth0">Note: The provisions stated above for crossing closures, grade  separations, wayside horns, pre-existing SSMs and pre-existing modified  SSMs apply for Public Authority Application to FRA as well.</p><p class="depth0">D.

FRA will review the application to determine the  appropriateness of the proposed effectiveness rates, and whether or not  the proposed application demonstrates that the quiet zone meets the  requirements of the rule.

Introduction</p><p class="depth0">The public authority is responsible for providing notification to  parties that will be affected by the quiet zone. There are several  different types of notifications and a public authority may have to make  more than one notification during the entire process of complying with  the regulation. The notification process is to ensure that interested  parties are made aware in a timely manner of the establishment or  continuation of quiet zones. It will also provide an opportunity for  State agencies and affected railroads to provide input to the public  authority during the development of quiet zones. Specific information is  to be provided so that the crossings in the quiet zone can be  identified. Providing the appropriate notification is important because  once the rule becomes effective, railroads will be obligated to sound  train horns when approaching all public crossings unless notified in  accordance with the rule that a New Quiet Zone has been established or  that a Pre-Rule or Intermediate Quiet Zone is being continued.</p><p class="depth0">B. Notice of Intent--Sec. 222.43(b)</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of the Notice of Intent is to provide notice to the  railroads and State agencies that the public authority is planning on  creating a New Quiet Zone or implementing new SSMs or ASMs within a Pre- Rule Quiet Zone.

The third column,  ``Crossing Risk Index w/o Horns'', is the risk index for each crossing  after it has been inflated by 66.8% to account for the lack of train  horns.   The fourth column, ``SSM Eff'', is the effectiveness of the SSM at the  crossing. A zero indicates that no SSM has been applied. The last  column, ``Crossing Risk Index w/o Horns Plus SSM'', is the inflated risk  index for the crossing after being reduced by the implementation of the  SSM. At the bottom of the table are two values. The first is the Risk  Index with Horns (``RIWH'') which represents the average initial amount  of risk in the proposed quiet zone with the train horn sounding. The  second is the Quiet Zone Risk Index (``QZRI''), which is the average  risk in the proposed quiet zone taking into consideration the increased  risk caused by the lack of train horns and the reductions in risk  attributable to the installation of SSMs. For this example it is assumed  that the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold is 17,030.

There are four public crossings in the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone.  Three of the crossings are equipped with flashing lights and gates, and  the fourth (Z Street) is passively signed with a STOP sign. The length  of the quiet zone is 0.6 mile, and there are no private crossings within  the proposed zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The tables that follow are very similar to the tables in Example  1. The street name is shown in the first column, and the existing risk  index for each crossing (``Crossing Risk Index w/o Horns'') in the  second. This is a change from the first example because the risk is  calculated without train horns sounding because of the existing ban on  whistles. The third column, ``Crossing Risk Index w/ Horns'', is the  risk index for each crossing after it has been adjusted to reflect what  the risk would have been had train horns been sounding. This is  mathematically done by dividing the existing risk index for the three  gated crossing by 1.668. The risk at the passive crossing at Z Street is  divided by 1.749. (See the above discussion in ``Pre-Rule Quiet Zones-- Establishment Overview'' for more information.) The fourth column, ``SSM  Eff'', is the effectiveness of the SSM at the crossing. A zero indicates  that no SSM has been applied. The last column, ``Crossing Risk Index w/o  Horns Plus SSM'', is the risk index without horns for the crossing after  being reduced for the implementation of the SSM. At the bottom of the  table are two values. The first is the Risk Index with Horns (RIWH),  which represents the average initial amount of risk in the proposed  quiet zone with the train horn sounding. The second is the Quiet Zone  Risk Index (``QZRI''), which is the average risk in the proposed quiet  zone taking into consideration the increased risk caused by the lack of  train horns and reductions in risk attributable to the installation of  SSMs. Once again it is assumed that the Nationwide Significant Risk  Threshold is 17,030. The Quiet Zone Risk Index must be reduced to either  the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold (17,030) or to the Risk Index  with Horns in order to qualify under the rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Table 5 shows the existing conditions in the proposed quiet  zone.

Since the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold is  less than the calculated Risk Index with Horns, the public authority's  goal will be to reduce the risk to at least value of the Risk Index with  Horns.

They allow  users to rank candidate crossings for safety improvements by collision  probability. There are three formulas, one for each warning device  category:</p><p class="depth0">1. automatic gates with flashing lights;</p><p class="depth0">2. flashing lights with no gates; and</p><p class="depth0">3. passive warning devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The prediction formulas can be used to derive the following for  each crossing:</p><p class="depth0">1. the predicted collisions (PC)</p><p class="depth0">2. the probability of a fatal collision given that a collision  occurs (P(FC[verbar]C))</p><p class="depth0">3. the probability of a casualty collision given that a collision  occurs (P(CC[verbar]C))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The following factors are the determinants of the number of  predicted collisions per year:</p><p class="depth0">1. average annual daily traffic</p><p class="depth0">2. total number of trains per day</p><p class="depth0">3. number of highway lanes</p><p class="depth0">4. number of main tracks</p><p class="depth0">5. maximum timetable train speed</p><p class="depth0">6. whether the highway is paved or not</p><p class="depth0">7. number of through trains per day during daylight hours</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The resulting basic prediction is improved in two ways. It is  enriched by the particular crossing's collision history for the previous  five years and it is calibrated by resetting normalizing constants. The  normalizing constants are reset so that the sum of the predicted  accidents in each warning device group (passive, flashing lights, gates)  for the top twenty percent most hazardous crossings exactly equals the  number of accidents which occurred in a recent period for the top twenty  percent of that group. This adjustment factor allows the formulas to  stay current with collision trends. The calibration also corrects for  errors such as data entry errors. The final output is the predicted  number of collisions (PC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The severity formulas answer the question, ``What is the chance  that a fatality (or casualty) will happen, given that a collision has  occurred?'' The fatality formula calculates the probability of a fatal  collision given that a collision occurs (i.e., the probability of a  collision in which a fatality occurs) P(FC[verbar]C). Similarly, the  casualty formula calculates the probability of a casualty collision  given that a collision occurs P(CC[verbar]C). As casualties consist of  both fatalities and injuries, the probability of a non-fatal injury  collision is found by subtracting the probability of a fatal collision  from the probability of a casualty collision. To convert the probability  of a fatal or casualty collision to the number of expected fatal or  casualty collisions, that probability is multiplied by the number of  predicted collisions (PC).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For the prediction and severity index formulas, please see the  following DOT publications: Summary of the DOT Rail-Highway Crossings  Resource Allocation Procedure--Revised, June 1987, and the Rail-Highway  Crossing Resource Allocation Procedure: User's Guide, Third Edition,  August 1987. Both documents are in the docket for this rulemaking and  also available through the National Technical Information Service  located in Springfield, Virginia 22161.</p><p class="depth0">Risk Index</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The risk index is basically the predicted cost to society of the  casualties that are expected to result from the predicted collisions at  a crossing. It incorporates three outputs of the DOT prediction  formulas. The two components of a risk index are:  1. Predicted Cost of Fatalities = PC x P(FC[verbar]C) x (Average Number</p><p class="depth0">of Fatalities Observed In Fatal Collisions) x $3 million 2.

Certain records will be excluded, including records  pertaining to incidents where the driver was not in the motor vehicle or  where the motor vehicle struck the train beyond the fourth locomotive or  rail car that entered the crossing. FRA believes that sounding the train  horn would not be very effective at preventing such incidents. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ The data used to make these exclusions is contained in blocks  18--Position of Car Unit in Train; 19--Circumstance: Rail Equipment  Struck/Struck by Highway User; 28--Number of Locomotive Units; and 29-- Number of Cars on the current FRA Form 6180-57 Highway-Rail Grade  Crossing Accident/Incident Report.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Collisions in the group containing the gated crossings  nationwide where horns were routinely sounded will then be identified as  fatal, injury only or no casualty. Collisions will be identified as  fatal if one or more deaths occurred, regardless of whether injuries  were also sustained. Collisions will be identified as injury only when  injuries, but no fatalities, resulted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The collisions (incidents) will be summarized by year for the  five-year period preceding the year in which the risk index is being  updated. The fatality rate for each year will be calculated by dividing  the number of fatalities by the number of fatal incidents. The injury  rate will be calculated by dividing the number of injuries in injury  only incidents by the number of injury only incidents. FRA will publish  updated fatality and injury rates on an annual basis in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Per guidance from DOT, $3 million is the value placed on  preventing a fatality. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) developed by  the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine categorizes  injuries into six levels of severity. Each AIS level is assigned a value  of injury avoidance as a fraction of the value of avoiding a fatality .  FRA rates collisions that occur at train speeds in excess of 25 mph as  an AIS level 5 ($2,287,500) and injuries that result from collisions  involving trains traveling under 25 mph as an AIS level 2 ($46,500).  About half of grade crossing collisions occur at speeds greater than 25  mph. Therefore, FRA estimates that the value of preventing the average  injury resulting from a grade crossing collision is $1,167,000 (the  average of an AIS-5 injury and an AIS-2 injury).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Notice that the quantity [PC*P(FC[verbar]C)] represents the  expected number of fatal collisions. Similarly, {PC*[P(CC[verbar]C)- P(FC[verbar]C)]{time}  represents the expected number of injury  collisions. These are then multiplied by their respective average number  of fatalities and injuries (from the table above) to develop the number  of expected casualties.

Horn shall be directed toward approaching traffic.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix F to Part 222--Diagnostic Team Considerations</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this part, a diagnostic team is a group of  knowledgeable representatives of parties of interest in a highway-rail   grade crossing, organized by the public authority responsible for that  crossing who, using crossing safety management principles, evaluate  conditions at a grade crossing to make determinations or recommendations  for the public authority concerning the safety needs at that crossing.  Crossings proposed for inclusion in a quiet zone should be reviewed in  the field by a diagnostic team composed of railroad personnel, public  safety or law enforcement, engineering personnel from the State agency  responsible for grade crossing safety, and other concerned parties.</p><p class="depth0">This diagnostic team, using crossing safety management principles,  should evaluate conditions at a grade crossing to make determinations  and recommendations concerning safety needs at that crossing. The  diagnostic team can evaluate a crossing from many perspectives and can  make recommendations as to what safety measures authorized by this part  might be utilized to compensate for the silencing of the train horns  within the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">All Crossings Within a Proposed Quiet Zone</p><p class="depth0">The diagnostic team should obtain and review the following  information about each crossing within the proposed quiet zone:</p><p class="depth0">1. Current highway traffic volumes and percent of trucks;</p><p class="depth0">2. Posted speed limits on all highway approaches;</p><p class="depth0">3. Maximum allowable train speeds, both passenger and freight;</p><p class="depth0">4. Accident history for each crossing under consideration;</p><p class="depth0">5. School bus or transit bus use at the crossing; and</p><p class="depth0">6. Presence of U.S. DOT grade crossing inventory numbers clearly  posted at each of the crossings in question.</p><p class="depth0">The diagnostic team should obtain all inventory information for each  crossing and should check, while in the field, to see that inventory  information is up-to-date and accurate. Outdated inventory information  should be updated as part of the quiet zone development process.</p><p class="depth0">When in the field, the diagnostic team should take note of the  physical characteristics of each crossing, including the following  items:</p><p class="depth0">1. Can any of the crossings within the proposed quiet zone be closed  or consolidated with another adjacent crossing? Crossing elimination  should always be the preferred alternative and it should be explored for  crossings within the proposed quiet zone.</p><p class="depth0">2. What is the number of lanes on each highway approach? Note the  pavement condition on each approach, as well as the condition of the  crossing itself.</p><p class="depth0">3. Is the grade crossing surface smooth, well graded and free  draining?</p><p class="depth0">4. Does the alignment of the railroad tracks at the crossing create  any problems for road users on the crossing? Are the tracks in  superelevation (are they banked on a curve?) and does this create a  conflict with the vertical alignment of the crossing roadway?</p><p class="depth0">5. Note the distance to the nearest intersection or traffic signal  on each approach (if within 500 feet or so of the crossing or if the  signal or intersection is determined to have a potential impact on  highway traffic at the crossing because of queuing or other special  problems).</p><p class="depth0">6. If a roadway that runs parallel to the railroad tracks is within  100 feet of the railroad tracks when it crosses an intersecting road  that also crosses the tracks, the appropriate advance warning signs  should be posted as shown in the MUTCD.</p><p class="depth0">7. Is the posted highway speed (on each approach to the crossing)  appropriate for the alignment of the roadway and the configuration of  the crossing?</p><p class="depth0">8. Does the vertical alignment of the crossing create the potential  for a ``hump crossing'' where long, low-clearance vehicles might get  stuck on the crossing?</p><p class="depth0">9. What are the grade crossing warning devices in place at each  crossing? Flashing lights and gates are required for each public  crossing in a New Quiet Zone. Are all required warning devices, signals,  pavement markings and advance signing in place, visible and in good  condition for both day and night time visibility?</p><p class="depth0">10. What kind of train detection is in place at each crossing? Are  these systems old or outmoded; are they in need of replacement,  upgrading, or refurbishment?</p><p class="depth0">11. Are there sidings or other tracks adjacent to the crossing that  are often used to store railroad cars, locomotives, or other equipment  that could obscure the vision of road users as they approach the  crossings in the quiet zone? Clear visibility may help to reduce  automatic warning device violations.</p><p class="depth0">12. Are motorists currently violating the warning devices at any of  the crossings at an excessive rate?</p><p class="depth0">13. Do collision statistics for the corridor indicate any potential  problems at any of the crossings?</p><p class="depth0">14. If school buses or transit buses use crossings within the  proposed quiet zone corridor, can they be rerouted to use a single  crossing within or outside of the quiet zone?</p><p class="depth0">Private Crossings Within a Proposed Quiet Zone</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the items discussed above, a diagnostic team should  note the following issues when examining any private crossings within a  proposed quiet zone:</p><p class="depth0">1. How often is the private crossing used?</p><p class="depth0">2. What kind of signing or pavement markings are in place at the  private crossing?</p><p class="depth0">3. What types of vehicles use the private crossing?</p><p class="depth0">School buses</p><p class="depth0">Large trucks</p><p class="depth0">Hazmat carriers</p><p class="depth0">Farm equipment</p><p class="depth0">4. What is the volume, speed and type of train traffic over the  crossing?</p><p class="depth0">5. Do passenger trains use the crossing?</p><p class="depth0">6. Do approaching trains sound the horn at the private crossing?</p><p class="depth0">State or local law requires it?</p><p class="depth0">Railroad safety rule requires it?</p><p class="depth0">7. Are there any nearby crossings where train horns sound that might  also provide some warning if train horns were not sounded at the private  crossing?</p><p class="depth0">8. What are the approach (corner) sight distances?</p><p class="depth0">9. What is the clearing sight distance for all approaches?</p><p class="depth0">10. What are the private roadway approach grades?</p><p class="depth0">11. What are the private roadway pavement surfaces?</p><p class="depth0">Pedestrian Crossings Within a Proposed Quiet Zone</p><p class="depth0">In addition to the items discussed in the section titled, ``All  crossings within a proposed quiet zone'', a diagnostic team should note  the following issues when examining any pedestrian crossings within a  proposed quiet zone:</p><p class="depth0">1. How often is the pedestrian crossing used?</p><p class="depth0">2. What kind of signing or pavement markings are in place at the  pedestrian crossing?</p><p class="depth0">3. What is the volume, speed, and type of train traffic over the  crossing?</p><p class="depth0">4. Do approaching trains sound the horn at the pedestrian crossing?</p><p class="depth0">State or local law requires it?</p><p class="depth0">Railroad safety rule requires it?</p><p class="depth0">5. Are there any crossings where train horns sound that might also  provide some warning if train horns were not sounded at the pedestrian  crossing?</p><p class="depth0">6.
