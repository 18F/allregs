Fabric filters equipped with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or other secondary filter are allowed to monitor less frequently, as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must perform semiannual inspections and maintenance to ensure proper performance of each fabric filter. This includes inspection of structural and filter integrity. You must record the results of these inspections.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You must install, maintain, and operate a pressure drop monitoring device to measure the differential pressure drop across the fabric filter during all times when the process is operating. The pressure drop shall be recorded at least once per day. If a pressure drop is observed outside of the normal operational ranges, you must record the incident and take immediate corrective actions. You must also record the corrective actions taken. You must submit a monitoring system performance report in accordance with Sec. 63.10(e)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You must conduct a visible emissions observation at least once per day to verify that no visible emissions are occurring at the discharge point to the atmosphere from any emissions source subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If visible emissions are detected, you must record the incident and conduct an opacity measurement in accordance with 40 CFR 60.374(b)(3). You must record the results of each opacity measurement. If the measurement exceeds the applicable opacity standard in 40 CFR 60.372(a)(7) or (8), you must submit this information in an excess emissions report required under Sec. 63.10(e)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Fabric filters equipped with a HEPA filter or other secondary filter are allowed to monitor less frequently, as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If you are using a pressure drop monitoring device to measure the differential pressure drop across the fabric filter in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, you must record the pressure drop at least once per week.
