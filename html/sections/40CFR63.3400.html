section to the Administrator:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must submit an initial notification as required by Sec. 63.9(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial notification for existing affected sources must be submitted no later than 1 year before the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.3330(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial notification for new and reconstructed affected sources must be submitted as required by Sec. 63.9(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of this subpart, a title V or part 70 permit application may be used in lieu of the initial notification required under Sec. 63.9(b), provided the same information is contained in the permit application as required by Sec. 63.9(b) and the State to which the permit application has been submitted has an approved operating permit program under part 70 of this chapter and has received delegation of authority from the EPA to implement and enforce this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you are using a permit application in lieu of an initial notification in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the permit application must be submitted by the same due date specified for the initial notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must submit a semiannual compliance report according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance report dates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first compliance report must cover the period beginning on the compliance date that is specified for your

specified for your affected source in Sec. 63.3330.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The first compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date follows the end of the calendar half immediately following the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in Sec. 63.3330.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each subsequent

submitting semiannual reports pursuant to Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or Sec. 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of according to the dates in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Statement by a responsible official with that official's name, title, and signature certifying the accuracy of the content of the report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Date of report and beginning and ending dates of the reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If there are no deviations from any emission limitations (emission limit or operating limit) that apply to you, a statement that there were no deviations from the emission limitations during the reporting period, and that no CMS was inoperative, inactive, malfunctioning, out-of-control, repaired, or adjusted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For each deviation from an emission limitation (emission limit or operating limit) that applies to you and that occurs at an affected source where you are not using a CEMS to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, the compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, and:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The total operating time of each affected source during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Information on the number, duration, and cause of deviations (including unknown cause), if applicable, and the

and other calibration checks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> For each deviation from an emission limit occurring at an affected source where you are using a CEMS to comply with the emission limit in this subpart, you must include the information in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) and (vi)(A) through (J) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date and time that each malfunction started and stopped.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The date and time that each CEMS and CPMS, if applicable, was inoperative except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks.</p><p

period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> A breakdown of the total duration of the deviations during the reporting period into those that are due to startup, shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> A summary of the total duration (in hours) of CEMS and CPMS downtime during the reporting period and the total duration of CEMS and CPMS downtime as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> A breakdown of the total duration of CEMS and CPMS downtime during the reporting period into periods

that are due to monitoring equipment malfunctions, nonmonitoring equipment malfunctions, quality assurance/quality control calibrations, other known causes, and other unknown causes.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> The date of the latest CEMS and CPMS certification or audit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> A description of any changes in CEMS, CPMS, or controls since the last reporting period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must submit a Notification of Performance Tests as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.7 and 63.9(e) if you are complying with the emission standard using a control device and you are required to conduct a performance test of the control device. This notification and the site-specific test plan required under Sec. 63.7(c)(2) must identify the operating parameters to be monitored to ensure that the capture efficiency of the capture system and the control efficiency of the control device determined during the performance test are maintained. Unless EPA objects to the parameter or requests changes, you may consider the parameter approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must submit a Notification of Compliance Status as specified in Sec. 63.9(h).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must submit performance test reports as specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(2) if you are using a control device to comply with the emission standard and you have not obtained a waiver from the performance test requirement or you are not exempted from this requirement by Sec. 63.3360(b). The performance test reports must be submitted as part of the notification of compliance status required in Sec. 63.3400(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You must submit startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports as specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5), except that the provisions in subpart A of this part pertaining to startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions do not apply unless a control device is used to comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction of an affected source (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are not consistent with the procedures specified in the affected source's SSMP required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3), the owner or operator must state such information in the report.
