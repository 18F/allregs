                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under the FOIA, there are four categories of requesters: Commercial  use requesters, educational and non-commercial scientific institutions,  representatives of the news media, and all other requesters. The fees  for each of these categories are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Commercial use requesters. When the Department receives a  request for documents for commercial use as defined in Sec. 171.11(l),  it will assess charges that recover the full direct costs of searching  for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the record sought.  Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search  time or 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. The Department may  recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is  ultimately no disclosure of records (see Sec. 171.16(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Educational and non-commercial scientific institution  requesters. The Department shall provide documents to requesters in this  category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the  first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a  requester must show that the request is being made as authorized by and  under the auspices of a qualifying institution, as defined in Sec.  171.11(m) and (n), and that the records are not sought for a commercial  use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from  an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non- commercial scientific institution) research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Representatives of the news media. The Department shall provide  documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction  alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for  inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in Sec.  171.11(o), and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A  request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the  requester shall not be considered to be a commercial use request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All other requesters. The Department shall charge requesters who  do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full  reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are  responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of  reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished  without charge.</p>
