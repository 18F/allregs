See Secs. 600.308 and 600.310 for specifications that apply for vehicles powered by electricity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Vehicle description. Where the fuel economy label is physically incorporated with the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act label, no further vehicle description is needed. If the fuel economy label is separate from the Automobile Information Disclosure Act label, describe the vehicle in a location on the label that does not interfere with the other required information. In cases where the vehicle description may not easily fit on the label, the manufacturer may request Administrator approval of modifications to the label format to accommodate this information. Include the following items in the vehicle description, if applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Model year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle car line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Engine displacement, in cubic inches, cubic centimeters, or liters whichever is consistent with the customary description of that engine.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transmission class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other descriptive information, as necessary, such as number of engine cylinders, to distinguish otherwise identical model types or, in the case of specific labels, vehicle configurations, as approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Gas guzzler provisions. For vehicles requiring a tax statement under Sec. 600.513, add the phrase ``$x gas guzzler tax'', where $x is the value of the tax. The tax value required by this paragraph (h) is based on the combined fuel economy value for the model type calculated according to Sec. 600.513 and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mpg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Alternative label provisions for special cases. The Administrator may approve modifications to the style guidelines if space is limited. The Administrator may also prescribe special label format and information requirements for vehicles that are not specifically described in this subpart, such as hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines or hybrid electric vehicles that have engines operating on fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel. The Administrator may also approve alternate wording of statements on the label if that is necessary or appropriate for a given fuel or combination of fuels. The revised labeling specifications will conform to the principles established in this subpart, with any appropriate modifications or additions to reflect the vehicle's unique characteristics. See 49 U.S.C. 32908(b)(1)(F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Rounding. Unless the regulation specifies otherwise, do not round intermediate values, but round final calculated values identified in this subpart to the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Updating information. EPA will periodically publish updated information that is needed to comply with the labeling requirements in this subpart. This includes the annual mileage rates

and fuel-cost information, the ``best and worst'' values needed for calculating relative ratings for individual vehicles, and the various rating criteria as specified in Sec. 600.311.

Sec. 600.311-12  Determination of values for fuel economy labels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Fuel economy. Determine city and highway fuel economy values as described in Sec. 600.210-12(a) and (b). Determine combined fuel economy values as described in Sec. 600.210-12(c). Note that the label for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles requires separate values for combined fuel economy for vehicle operation before and after the vehicle's battery is fully discharged; we generally refer to these modes as ``Blended Electric+Gas'' (or ``Electric Only'', as applicable) and ``Gas only''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> CO2 emission rate. Determine the engine-related CO2 emission rate as described in Sec. 600.210-12(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fuel consumption rate. Calculate the fuel consumption rate as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For vehicles with engines that are not plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in gallons per 100 miles (or gasoline gallon equivalent per 100 miles for fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel) with the following formula, rounded to the first decimal place:
Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG
Where:
MPG = The value for combined fuel economy from Sec. 600.210-12(c),</p><p class="depth0">rounded to the nearest whole mpg.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate two separate fuel consumption rates as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the fuel consumption rate based on engine operation after the battery is fully discharged as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the fuel consumption rate during operation before the battery is fully discharged in kW-hours per 100 miles as described in SAE J1711 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 600.011), as described in Sec. 600.116.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For electric vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in kW-hours

per 100 miles with the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole number:

Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG
Where:
MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this</p><p class="depth0">section, in miles per kW-hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, calculate the fuel consumption rate in kilograms of hydrogen per 100 miles with the following formula, rounded to the nearest whole number:

Fuel Consumption Rate = 100/MPG
Where:
MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this</p><p class="depth0">section, in miles per kilogram of hydrogen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings. Determine a vehicle's fuel economy and greenhouse gas ratings as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For gasoline-fueled vehicles that are not plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (including flexible fuel vehicles that operate on gasoline), establish a single rating based only on the vehicle's combined fuel economy from paragraph (a) of this section. For all other vehicles, establish a fuel economy rating based on the vehicle's combined fuel economy and establish a separate greenhouse gas rating based on combined CO2 emission rates from paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> We will establish the fuel economy rating based on fuel consumption values specified in paragraph (c) of this section. We will establish the value dividing the 5 and 6 ratings based on the fuel consumption corresponding to the projected achieved Corporate Average Fuel Economy level for the applicable model year. This is intended to prevent below-average vehicles from getting an above-average fuel economy rating for the label. We will establish the remaining cutpoints based on a statistical evaluation of available information from the certification database for all model types. Specifically, the mean value plus two standard deviations will define the point between the 1 and 2 ratings. The mean value minus two standard deviations will define the point between the 9 and 10 ratings. The 1 rating will apply for any vehicle with higher fuel consumption rates than the 2 rating; similarly, the 10 rating will apply for any vehicle with lower fuel consumption rates than the 9 rating. We will calculate range values for the remaining intermediate ratings by dividing the range into equal intervals. We will convert the resulting range intervals to equivalent miles-per-gallon values. We will define the greenhouse gas ratings by converting the values from the fuel economy rating intervals to equivalent CO2 emission rates using the conventional conversion factor for gasoline (8887 g CO2 per gallon of consumed fuel).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Annual fuel cost. Calculate annual fuel costs as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, calculate the total annual fuel cost with the following formula, rounded to nearest $50:

Annual Fuel Cost = Fuel Price/MPG x Average Annual Miles
Where:
Fuel Price = The estimated fuel price provided by EPA for the type of</p><p class="depth0">fuel required for the vehicle. The units are dollars per</p><p class="depth0">gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel, dollars per gasoline</p><p class="depth0">gallon equivalent for natural gas, dollars per kW-hr for plug-</p><p class="depth0">in electricity, and dollars per kilogram of hydrogen for</p><p class="depth0">hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.MPG = The combined fuel economy value from paragraph (a) of this</p><p class="depth0">section. The units are miles per gallon for gasoline and</p><p class="depth0">diesel fuel, miles per gasoline gallon equivalent for natural</p><p class="depth0">gas, miles per kW-hr for plug-in electricity, and miles per</p><p class="depth0">kilogram of hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.Average Annual Miles = The estimated annual mileage figure provided by</p><p class="depth0">EPA, in miles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For dual fuel vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles, disregard operation on the alternative fuel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, calculate annual fuel cost as described in this paragraph (e)(3). This description applies for vehicles whose engine starts only after the battery is fully discharged. Use good engineering judgment to extrapolate this for calculating annual fuel cost for vehicles that use combined power from the battery and the engine before the battery is fully discharged. Calculate annual fuel cost as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the charge-depleting ranges for city and highway operation as described in paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section. Adjust each of these values for 5-cycle operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate multi-day individual utility factors (UF) as described in Sec. 600.116 corresponding to the driving ranges from paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Calculate values for the vehicle's average fuel economy over the charge-depleting range (in miles per kW-hr) for city and highway operation as described in Sec. 600.210. Adjust each of these values for 5-cycle operation. Convert these to $/mile values by dividing the appropriate fuel price from paragraph (e)(1) of this section by the average fuel economy determined in this paragraph (e)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Calculate values for the vehicle's average fuel economy over the charge-sustaining range (in miles per gallon) for city and highway operation as described in Sec. 600.210-12. Adjust each of these values for 5-cycle operation. Convert these to $/mile values by dividing the appropriate fuel price from paragraph (e)(1) of this section by the average fuel economy determined in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Calculate a composite $/mile value for city driving using the following equation:

$/mile = $/mileCD x UF + $/mileCS x (1-UF)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Repeat the calculation in paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section for highway driving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Calculate the annual fuel cost based on the combined values for city and highway driving using the following equation:
Annual fuel cost = ($/milecity x 0.55 + $/milehwy x 0.45) x Average Annual Miles</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Round the annual fuel cost to the nearest $50 by dividing the unrounded annual fuel cost by 50, then rounding the result to the nearest whole number, then multiplying this rounded result by 50 to determine the annual fuel cost to be used for purposes of labeling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Fuel savings. Calculate an estimated five-year cost increment relative to an average vehicle by multiplying the annual fuel cost from paragraph (e) of this section by 5 and subtracting this value from the average five-year fuel cost. We will calculate the average five-year fuel cost from the annual fuel cost equation in paragraph (e) of this section based on a gasoline-fueled vehicle with a mean fuel economy value, consistent with the value dividing the 5 and 6 ratings under paragraph (d) of this section. The average five-year fuel cost for model year 2012 is $12,600 for a 22-mpg vehicle that drives 15,000 miles per year with gasoline priced at $3.70 per gallon. We may periodically update this five year reference fuel cost for later model years to better characterize the fuel economy for an average vehicle. Round the calculated five-year cost increment to the nearest $50. Negative values represent a cost increase compared to the average vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Smog rating. Establish a rating for exhaust emissions other than CO2 based on the applicable emission standards for the appropriate model year as shown in Tables 1 through 3 of this section. For Independent Commercial Importers that import vehicles not subject to Tier 2 or Tier 3 emission standards, the vehicle's smog rating is 1. Similarly, if a manufacturer certifies vehicles to emission standards that are less stringent than all the identified standards for any reason, the vehicle's smog rating is 1. If EPA or California emission standards change in the future, we may revise the emission levels corresponding to each rating for future model years as appropriate to reflect the changed standards. If this occurs, we would publish the revised ratings as described in Sec. 600.302-12(k), allowing sufficient lead time to make the changes; we would also expect to initiate a rulemaking to update the smog rating in the regulation.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 of Sec.  600.311-12--Criteria for Establishing Smog Rating for Model Year 2025 and Later----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">U.S. EPA Tier 3 Emission       California Air Resources Board LEV III</p><p class="depth0">Rating                          Standard                          Emission Standard----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1..................................

Starting in the 2013 model year, SUVs will be divided between small sport utility vehicles and standard sport utility vehicles. Pickup trucks and SUVs are separated by car line on the basis of gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). For a product line with more than one GVWR, establish the characteristic GVWR value for the product line by calculating the arithmetic average of all distinct GVWR values less than or equal to 8,500 pounds available for that product line. The Administrator may determine that specific light trucks should be most appropriately placed in a different class or in the special purpose vehicle class as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, based on the features and characteristics of the specific vehicle, consumer information provided by the manufacturer, and other information available to consumers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Small pickup trucks.
