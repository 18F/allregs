Sec. 3009.171-4  Determination of ownership, control, or operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Whether an individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern is determined on the specific facts of the case, with reference to the factors identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. Prior to contract award, such individual must provide any additional documentation to the contracting officer upon the contracting officer's request for the agency's use in determining ownership, control, or operation. The refusal to provide or to timely provide such documentation may serve as grounds for the contracting officer to refuse making contract award to the business concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any financial, voting, operational, or employment interest in the business concern of a spouse, child, or other family member of, or person sharing a household with, the individual will be imputed to the individual in determining whether and the extent to which the individual owns, controls, or operates the business concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An individual owns, controls, or operates a business concern by fulfilling or holding the following types of roles or interests with respect to the business concern:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Director or officer, including incumbents of boards and offices that perform duties ordinarily performed by

a chairman or member of a board of directors, a secretary, treasurer, president, a vice president, or other chief official of a business concern, including Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or Chief contracting official.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Officials of comparable function and status to those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection as exist in partnerships of all kind and other business organizations, including sole proprietorships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A general partner in a general or limited partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An individual with a limited partnership interest of 25% or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An individual that has the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Power to vote, directly or indirectly, 25% or more interest in any class of voting stock of the business concern;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ability to direct in any manner the election of a majority of the business concern's directors or trustees; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ability to exercise a controlling influence over the business concern's management, policies, or decision making.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Generally, the existence of one or more of the roles or interests set forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection, including roles or interests attributed to the individual, will be sufficient to determine that the individual owns, controls or operates the business concern. However, specific facts of the case may warrant a different determination by the contracting officer, where, for example, an indicator in paragraph (c) of this subsection, in light of all of the facts and circumstances, suggests that the individual lacks sufficient authority or autonomy to exert authority customarily associated with ownership or control or the assertion of operational prerogatives (e.g. the individual is one of twenty on a board of directors, plays no other role, and holds no other interest). Conversely, ownership, control, or the ability to operate the business concern, if it exists in fact, can be reflected by other roles or interests.

Sec. 3009.171-7  Contract award approval procedures for contractors with</p><p class="depth0">felony convictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The HCA has sole discretion to approve a request to permit award of a contract for FPS guard services to a business concern owned, controlled, or operated by an individual convicted of a felony, for any reason permitted by this regulation. This authority is not delegable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A business concern owned, operated or controlled by an individual convicted of any felony (including a serious felony) may submit an award request to the contracting officer. The basis for such request shall be that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this regulation; that such individual does not or no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a serious felony no longer poses the contract risk the Act and this regulation were designed to guard against. The business concern shall bear the burden of proof for award requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A copy of the award approval request with supporting documentation or a previously approved award request shall be attached with the bid or proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An award approval request shall contain the basis for the request, including, at a minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name and date of birth of individual convicted of a felony;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A full description of which roles or interests indicate that the individual owns, controls, or operates, or may own control or operate the business concern;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Date sentenced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Statute/Charge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Docket/Case Number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Court/Jurisdiction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The nature and circumstances surrounding the conviction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Protective measures taken by the individual or business concern to reduce or eliminate the risk of further misconduct;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Whether the individual has made full restitution for the felony; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Whether the individual has accepted responsibility for past misconduct resulting in the felony conviction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the contracting officer is unable to affirmatively determine that the subject felony is not a serious felony as defined in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.171-5; that such individual no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or that the commission of a serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and would be consistent with the mission of FPS, then the contracting officer shall deny the award approval request and not forward such request to the HCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For a felony that meets any of the following conditions, the contracting officer shall refer the award request, with a copy of the contracting officer's determination, to the HCA with a recommendation for approval:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The subject felony is not a serious felony as defined by this regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The convicted individual does not or no longer owns, controls or operates the business concern; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The commission of a serious felony no longer calls into question the individual or business concern's integrity or business ethics and that an award would be consistent with the mission of the FPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The HCA shall make a final written decision on the award approval request following referral and after any necessary additional inquiry.
