                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This rule governs on-site, in-person promotional  activities, including educational activities, by pharmaceutical company  representatives at VA medical facilities. It does not apply to the  distribution of information and materials through other means.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Criteria-for-use means clinical criteria developed by the Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) at a National level that describe how certain  drugs may be used. VA's criteria-for-use are available to the public at  www.pbm.va.gov. Exceptions may be applied at the local level for  operational reasons.</p><p class="depth0">Drug or drugs means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia,  official Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, official  National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,  treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or  any function of the body of man or other animals; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Articles intended for use as a component of any article  specified in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Drug-related supplies means supplies related to the use of a drug,  such as test strips or testing devices, inhalers, spacers, insulin  syringes, and tablet splitters.</p><p class="depth0">New molecular entity refers to a drug product containing an active  ingredient that has never before received U.S. Food and Drug  Administration approval.</p><p class="depth0">Non-promotable drugs are drugs designated by VA as non-promotable on  http://www.pbm.va.gov. A list of the drugs or drug-related supplies  classified by VA as non-promotable may be requested by contacting the VA  medical facility's Chief of Pharmacy Services.</p><p class="depth0">Non-VANF drugs or drug-related supplies means drugs or drug-related  supplies that do not appear on the VANF.</p><p class="depth0">Pharmaceutical company representative means any individual employed  by or contracted to represent a pharmaceutical manufacturer or retailer.</p><p class="depth0">VA medical facility means any property under the charge and control  of VA used to provide medical benefits, including Community-Based  Outpatient Clinics and similar facilities.</p><p class="depth0">VA National Formulary (VANF) drugs and/or drug-related supplies  means any drug or drug-related supply that appears on the VA National  Formulary (VANF). The VANF is available at www.pbm.va.gov, or may be  requested by contacting the VA medical facility's Chief of Pharmacy  Services.</p><p class="depth0">Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) means one of the networks  of VA medical facilities located in a particular region as designated by  VA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Promotion of drugs and drug-related supplies. Notwithstanding  Sec.  1.218(a)(8), VA will allow promotion of VANF drugs and drug- related supplies, and non-VANF drugs and drug-related supplies with  criteria-for-use, on-site and in-person at VA medical facilities if all  of the following are true:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Drugs or drug-related supplies are discussed, displayed and  represented accurately;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The promotion has significant educational value and does not  inappropriately divert VA staff from other activities that VA staff  would otherwise perform during duty hours, including patient care and  other educational activities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The drug or drug-related supply has not been classified by VA as  non-promotable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Promotion of non-VANF drugs and drug-related supplies without  criteria-for-use. Non-VANF drugs and drug-related supplies without  criteria-for-use may be promoted only if the requirements of paragraphs  (c)(1) through (3) of this section are met and the promotion is  specifically permitted by the VISN Pharmacist Executive, or Chief of  Pharmacy Services, or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Promotion of a new molecular entity. A new molecular entity may  be promoted only if the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of  this section are met and the promotion is specifically permitted by the  VISN Pharmacist Executive, or Chief of Pharmacy Services, or designee.  Such permission will be automatically revoked if the new molecular  entity is subsequently designated non-promotable. Such permission must  be reconsidered if the new molecular entity is denied VANF status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Educational programs and associated materials. For purposes of  this section, an educational program is a pre-scheduled event or meeting  during which a pharmaceutical company representative provides  information about a drug or drug-related supply. All educational  programs and associated materials must receive prior approval from the  person at the VA medical facility to whom such approval authority has  been delegated under local policy, usually the Chief of Pharmacy  Services. All materials associated with a proposed educational program  must be provided at least 60 days before the proposed date of the  educational program or distribution of associated materials, unless VA  agrees in an individual case to a different date, so that a  determination of their suitability can be made. The approval authority  will deem suitable any educational program and associated materials if  it is part of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or other duty  imposed by the Food and Drug Administration. Otherwise, educational  programs and associated materials will be deemed suitable if the  approval authority determines that they conform to the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Industry sponsorship must be disclosed in the introductory  remarks and in the announcement brochure. Sponsorship includes any  contribution, whether in the form of staple goods, personnel, or  financing, intended to support the educational program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If industry-sponsored and non-sponsored sources of data or other  analytical information exist for FDA-approved uses of a particular drug,  a direct comparison between the two sources must be disclosed in the  introductory remarks and in the announcement brochure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The educational program does not solicit protected health  information or patient participation in pharmaceutical company-sponsored  programs, except as may be required by Federal laws and regulations such  as an educational program that is part of a risk evaluation and  mitigation strategy required by the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Patient educational materials must not contain the name or logo  of the pharmaceutical manufacturer or be used for promotion of a  specific medication, unless the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Service  determines that the logo or name is inconspicuous and legal requirements  (e.g., trademark requirements) make their removal impractical. However,  this requirement does not apply to labeling required by the Food and  Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Educational programs and associated materials regarding a drug,  drug-related supply, or a new therapeutic indication for a drug that is  already on the VANF but has not yet been reviewed by VA, must be  submitted by the pharmaceutical company or pharmaceutical company  representative to the VA medical facility's Chief of Pharmacy Services  or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Educational programs and associated materials focusing primarily  on non-VANF drugs or drug-related supplies without criteria-for-use are  permitted only if those drugs or drug-related supplies may be promoted  under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Providing gifts, drugs or other promotional items to VA  employees or facilities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. No pharmaceutical company  representative may give, and   no VA employee may receive, any item (including but not limited to  promotional materials, continuing education materials, textbooks,  entertainment, and gratuities) that exceeds the value permissible for  acceptance under government ethical rules (5 CFR 2635.204(a)). However,  such items may be donated to a medical center library or individual  department for use by all employees, in accordance with medical center  policy. Gifts in support of VA staff official travel may be accepted by  the Department subject to advance legal review in accordance with 31  U.S.C. 1353, 41 CFR part 304, and VA policy regarding such gifts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Samples of drugs and drug-related supplies. Pharmaceutical  company representatives must submit samples of drugs and drug-related  supplies for approval to the person at the medical facility to whom such  responsibility is delegated under local policy, usually the Director.  All usage information pertaining to these drugs or drug-related supplies  must be forwarded to the VISN Pharmacist Executive or VISN Formulary  Committee. All samples of drugs or drug-related supplies must be  delivered to the Office of the Chief of Pharmacy Services for proper  storage, documentation and dispensing. Drug or drug-related supply  samples may not be provided to VA staff for their personal use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Donations of food. Pharmaceutical company representatives may  not provide food items of any type or any value to VA staff (including  volunteers and without compensation employees) or bring food items into  VA medical facilities for use by non-VA staff (e.g., employees of  affiliates).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Conduct of pharmaceutical company representatives. In addition  to the other provisions in this section, pharmaceutical company  representatives must conform to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contacts must be by appointment only. In order to minimize the  potential for disruption of patient care activities, a pharmaceutical  company representative must schedule an appointment before each visit.  Access to VA medical facilities by a pharmaceutical company  representative without an appointment is not permitted under any  circumstances. VA medical facilities may develop a list of individuals  or departments that may not be called-on by pharmaceutical company  representatives. A pharmaceutical company representative must not  attempt to make appointments with, or leave any materials for,  individuals or departments on the list. The list may be obtained at the  VA medical facility office of the Chief of Pharmacy Services. A  pharmaceutical company representative visiting a VA medical facility for  a scheduled appointment may not leave promotional materials for, or  initiate requests for meetings with, other VA staff; however,  pharmaceutical company representatives may respond to requests initiated  by VA staff during the visit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Paging VA employees. A pharmaceutical company representative may  not use the public address (paging) system to locate any VA employee.  Contacts using the electronic paging system (beepers) are permissible  only if specifically requested by the VA employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Marketing to students. Pharmaceutical company representatives  are prohibited from marketing to medical, pharmacy, nursing and other  health profession students, including residents. Exceptions may be  permitted when approved by, and conducted in the presence of, the staff  member providing clinical supervision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Attendance at conferences. A pharmaceutical company  representative may not attend a medical center conference where  information regarding individual patients is discussed or presented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Patient care areas. Pharmaceutical company representatives  generally may not wait for scheduled appointments or make presentations  in patient-care areas, but may briefly travel through them, when  necessary, to meet in a staff member's office. Patient-care areas  include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Patient rooms and ward areas where patients may be encountered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clinic examination rooms;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nurses stations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Intensive care units;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Operating room suites;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Urgent care centers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Emergency rooms (but not staff offices that may be located in  them); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Ambulatory treatment centers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Distribution of materials. Pharmaceutical company  representatives may only distribute materials on-site at the time and  location of a scheduled appointment or educational program. In no  circumstances may materials be left in patient care areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Non-compliance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. The visiting privileges of a  pharmaceutical company representative or multiple representatives may be  limited, suspended, or revoked by the written order of the Director of  the VA medical center of jurisdiction if the Director determines the  pharmaceutical company representative(s) failed to comply with the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of interim action. The Director will notify the  pharmaceutical company representative of the noncompliance and of the  Director's interim action under paragraph (i)(4) of this section. The  Director will also notify the supervisor of the pharmaceutical company  representative(s) if there have been multiple instances of misconduct.  The notice will offer 30 days to provide a response; however, the  interim action will be enforced effective the date of the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Final written order. At the end of the 30-day period for a  response, or after the Director receives a timely response, the Director  will issue to the pharmaceutical company representative and supervisor a  final written order either confirming the action taken as indicated in  the notice, or specifying another action to be taken under paragraph  (i)(4) of this section. The written order may also state that the  Director has determined that no further action is required. Any final  written order issued by the Director shall include a summary of the  circumstances of the violation, a listing of the specific provisions of  this section that the pharmaceutical company representative(s) violated,  and the bases for the Director's determination regarding the appropriate  action. Notice concerning a final written order suspending or  permanently revoking the visiting privileges of multiple pharmaceutical  company representatives shall include specific notice concerning the  right to review of the Director's order by the Under Secretary for  Health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Actions. Actions that may be imposed under this section include  limitation, suspension, or permanent revocation of visiting privileges  at one or more VA medical facilities. In determining the appropriate  action, the Director shall consider the requirements of this section,  the circumstances of the improper conduct, any prior acts of misconduct  by the same pharmaceutical company representative, any response  submitted by the pharmaceutical company representative or their  supervisor under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, and any prior written  orders issued or other actions taken with respect to similar acts of  misconduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Review. The pharmaceutical company may request the Under  Secretary's review within 30 days of the date of the Director's final  written order by submitting a written request to the Director. The  Director shall forward the initial notice, any response, the final  written order, and the request for review to the Under Secretary for a  final VA decision. VA will enforce the Director's final written order  while it is under review by the Under Secretary. The Director will  provide the individual who made the request written notice of the Under  Secretary's decision.
