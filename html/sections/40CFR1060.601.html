                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> do not apply to  fuel caps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> New replacement fuel tanks and fuel lines must meet the  requirements of this part 1060 if they are intended to be used with  nonroad engines or equipment regulated under this part 1060, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability of standards between January 1, 2012 and December  31, 2019. Manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and importers must  clearly state on the packaging for all replacement components that could  reasonably be used with nonroad engines how such components may be used  consistent with the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section. It is  presumed that such components are intended for use with nonroad engines  regulated under this part 1060 unless the components, or the packaging  for such components, clearly identify appropriate restrictions. This  requirement does not apply for components that are clearly not intended  for use with fuels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicability of standards after January 1, 2020. Starting  January 1, 2020 it is presumed that replacement components will be used  with nonroad engines regulated under this part 1060 if they can  reasonably be used with such engines. Manufacturers, distributors,  retailers, and importers are therefore obligated to take reasonable  steps to ensure that any uncertified components are not used to replace  certified   components. This would require labeling the components and may also  require restricting the sales and requiring the ultimate purchaser to  agree to not use the components inappropriately. This requirement does  not apply for components that are clearly not intended for use with  fuels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicability of the tampering prohibition. If a fuel tank or  fuel line needing replacement was certified to meet the emission  standards in this part with a family emission limit below the otherwise  applicable standard, the new replacement fuel tank or fuel line must be  certified to current emission standards, but need not be certified with  the same or lower family emission limit to avoid violating the tampering  prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manufacturers that generate or use evaporative emission credits  related to Marine SI engines in 40 CFR part 1045 or Small SI engines in  40 CFR part 1054 are subject to the emission standards for which they  are generating or using evaporative emission credits. These engines or  equipment must therefore be covered by a valid certificate of conformity  showing compliance with emission-credit provisions before being  introduced into U.S. commerce to avoid violating the prohibition of 40  CFR 1068.101(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If there is no valid certificate of conformity for any given  evaporative emission standard for new equipment, the manufacturers of  the engine, equipment and fuel-system components are each liable for  violations of the prohibited acts with respect to the fuel systems and  fuel-system components they have introduced into U.S. commerce,  including fuel systems and fuel-system components installed in engines  or equipment at the time the engines or equipment are introduced into  U.S. commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If new evaporative emission standards apply in a given model  year, your equipment in that model year must have fuel-system components  that are certified to the new standards, except that you may continue to  use up your normal inventory of earlier fuel-system components that were  built before the date of the new or changed standards. For example, if  your normal inventory practice is to keep on hand a one-month supply of  fuel tanks based on your upcoming production schedules, and a new tier  of standards starts to apply for the 2012 model year, you may order fuel  tanks based on your normal inventory requirements late in the fuel tank  manufacturer's 2011 model year and install those fuel tanks in your  equipment, regardless of the date of installation. Also, if your model  year starts before the end of the calendar year preceding new standards,  you may use fuel-system components from the previous model year (or  uncertified components if no standards were in place) for those units  you produce before January 1 of the year that new standards apply. If  emission standards do not change in a given model year, you may continue  to install fuel-system components from the previous model year without  restriction. You may not circumvent the provisions of 40 CFR  1068.101(a)(1) by stockpiling fuel-system components that were built  before new or changed standards take effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If equipment manufacturers hold certificates of conformity for  their equipment but they use only fuel-system components that have been  certified by other companies, they may satisfy their defect-reporting  obligations by tracking the information described in 40 CFR  1068.501(b)(1) related   to possible defects, reporting this information to the appropriate  component manufacturers, and keeping these records for eight years. Such  equipment manufacturers will not be considered in violation of 40 CFR  1068.101(b)(6) for failing to perform investigations, make calculations,  or submit reports to EPA as specified in 40 CFR 1068.501. See Sec.   1060.5(a).  [73 FR 59298, Oct. 8, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23027, Apr. 30, 2010]</p>
