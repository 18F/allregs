                            <p class="depth0">Irradiators whose construction begins after July 1, 1993, must meet  the design requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Shielding. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall design  shielding walls to meet generally accepted building code requirements  for reinforced concrete and design the walls, wall penetrations, and  entranceways to meet the radiation shielding requirements of Sec.  36.25. If the irradiator will use more than 2 x 10\17\ becquerels (5  million curies) of activity, the licensee shall evaluate the effects of  heating of the shielding walls by the irradiator sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foundations. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall  design the foundation, with consideration given to soil characteristics,  to ensure it is adequate to support the weight of the facility shield  walls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pool integrity. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall design  the pool to assure that it is leak resistant, that it is strong enough  to bear the weight of the pool water and shipping casks, that a dropped  cask would not fall on sealed sources, that all outlets or pipes meet  the requirements of Sec. 36.33(b), and that metal components are  metallurgically compatible with other components in the pool.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Water handling system. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall  verify that the design of the water purification system is adequate to  meet the requirements of Sec. 36.33(e). The system must be designed so  that water leaking from the system does not drain to unrestricted areas  without being monitored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Radiation monitors. For all irradiators, the licensee shall  evaluate the location and sensitivity of the monitor to detect sources  carried by the product conveyor system as required by Sec. 36.29(a).  The licensee shall verify that the product conveyor is designed to stop  before a source on the product conveyor would cause a radiation  overexposure to any person. For pool irradiators, if the licensee uses  radiation monitors to detect contamination under Sec. 36.59(b), the  licensee shall   verify that the design of radiation monitoring systems to detect pool  contamination includes sensitive detectors located close to where  contamination is likely to concentrate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Source rack. For pool irradiators, the licensee shall verify  that there are no crevices on the source or between the source and  source holder that would promote corrosion on a critical area of the  source. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall determine that  source rack drops due to loss of power will not damage the source rack  and that source rack drops due to failure of cables (or alternate means  of support) will not cause loss of integrity of sealed sources. For  panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall review the design of the  mechanism that moves the sources to assure that the likelihood of a  stuck source is low and that, if the rack sticks, a means exists to free  it with minimal risk to personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Access control. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall  verify from the design and logic diagram that the access control system  will meet the requirements of Sec. 36.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fire protection. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall  verify that the number, location, and spacing of the smoke and heat  detectors are appropriate to detect fires and that the detectors are  protected from mechanical and radiation damage. The licensee shall  verify that the design of the fire extinguishing system provides the  necessary discharge patterns, densities, and flow characteristics for  complete coverage of the radiation room and that the system is protected  from mechanical and radiation damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Source return. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall  verify that the source rack will automatically return to the fully  shielded position if offsite power is lost for more than 10 seconds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Seismic. For panoramic irradiators to be built in seismic areas,  the licensee shall design the reinforced concrete radiation shields to  retain their integrity in the event of an earthquake by designing to the  seismic requirements of an appropriate source such as American Concrete  Institute Standard ACI 318-89, ``Building Code Requirements for  Reinforced Concrete,'' Chapter 21, ``Special Provisions for Seismic  Design,'' or local building codes, if current.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Wiring. For panoramic irradiators, the licensee shall verify  that electrical wiring and electrical equipment in the radiation room  are selected to minimize failures due to prolonged exposure to  radiation.</p>
