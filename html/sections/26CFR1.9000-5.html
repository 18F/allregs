                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Years other than years affected by a net operating loss  carryback. If the taxpayer files a timely statement in accordance with  the provisions of Sec. 1.9000-3, the amount of the increase in tax  shown on such statement for a taxable year shall, except as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section, be considered for all purposes of the  Code, as tax shown on the return for such year. In general, such  increase shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as if it had  been tax shown on the return as originally filed. The provisions of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. A taxpayer filed his return showing a tax liability  computed under the methods of accounting provided by sections 452 and  462 as $1,000 and filed the statement in accordance with Sec. 1.9000-3  showing an increase in tax liability of $200. The tax computed as though  sections 452 and 462 had not been enacted is $1,200, and the difference  of $200 is the increase in the tax attributable to the repeal of  sections 452 and 462. This increase is considered to be tax shown on the  return for such taxable year. Additions to the tax for fraud or  negligence under section 6653 will be determined by reference to $1,200  (that is, $1,000 plus $200) as the tax shown on the return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Years affected by a net operating loss carryback. In the case of  a year which is affected by a net operating loss carryback from a year  to which an election under section 452 or 462 applies, that portion of  the amount of increase in tax shown on the statement for the year to  which the loss is carried back which is attributable to a decrease in  such net operating loss shall not be treated as tax shown on the return.</p>
