                                Sec. 780.142  Practices on a farm not related to farming operations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Practices performed on a farm in connection with nonfarming operations performed on or off such farm do not meet the requirement stated in Sec. 780.141. For example, if a farmer operates a gravel pit on his farm, none of the practices performed in connection with the operation of such gravel pit would be within section 3(f). Whether or not some practices are performed in connection with farming operations conducted on the farm where they are performed must be determined with reference to the purpose of the farmer for whom the practice is performed. Thus, land clearing operations may or may not be connected with such farming operations depending on whether or not the farmer intends to devote the cleared land to farm use.</p>
