                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Single-lumen silicone gel-filled breast  prosthesis. A single-lumen silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis is a  silicone rubber shell made of polysiloxane(s), such as  polydimethylsiloxane and polydiphenylsiloxane. The shell either contains  a fixed amount cross-linked   polymerized silicone gel, filler, and stabilizers or is filled to the  desired size with injectable silicone gel at time of implantation. The  device is intended to be implanted to augment or reconstruct the female  breast.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Double-lumen silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis. A double  lumen silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis is a silicone rubber inner  shell and a silicone rubber outer shell, both shells made of  polysiloxane(s), such as polydimethylsiloxane and polydiphenylsiloxane.  The inner shell contains fixed amounts of cross-linked polymerized  silicone gel, fillers, and stabilizers. The outer shell is inflated to  the desired size with sterile isotonic saline before or after  implantation. The device is intended to be implanted to augment or  reconstruct the female breast.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Polyurethane covered silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis. A  polyurethane covered silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis is an inner  silicone rubber shell made of polysiloxane(s), such as  polydimethylsiloxane and polydiphenylsiloxane, with an outer silicone  adhesive layer and an outer covering of polyurethane; contained within  the inner shell is a fixed amount of cross-linked polymerized silicone  gel, fillers, and stabilizers and an inert support structure  compartmentalizing the silicone gel. The device is intended to be  implanted to augment or reconstruct the female breast.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date premarket approval application (PMA) is required. A PMA is  required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before  July 9, 1991 for any silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis that was in  commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has on or before  July 9, 1991 been found to be substantially equivalent to a silicone  gel-filled breast prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before  May 28, 1976. Any other silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis shall have  an approved PMA in effect before being placed in commercial  distribution.
