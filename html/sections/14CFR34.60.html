                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 3,  Appendix 5, and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16, as applicable, to  demonstrate whether engines meet the applicable gaseous emission  standards specified in subpart C of this part. Measure the emissions of  all regulated gaseous pollutants. Use the equipment and procedures  specified in Appendix 2 and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 to determine  whether engines meet the applicable smoke standard specified in subpart  C of this part. The compliance demonstration consists of establishing a  mean value from testing the specified number of engines, then   calculating a ``characteristic level'' by applying a set of statistical  factors that take into account the number of engines tested. Round each  characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the  corresponding emission standard. For turboprop engines, use the  procedures specified for turbofan engines, consistent with good  engineering judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use a test fuel that meets the specifications described in  Appendix 4 of ICAO Annex 16. The test fuel must not have additives whose  purpose is to suppress smoke, such as organometallic compounds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prepare test engines by including accessories that are available  with production engines if they can reasonably be expected to influence  emissions. The test engine may not extract shaft power or bleed service  air to provide power to auxiliary gearbox-mounted components required to  drive aircraft systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test engines must reach a steady operating temperature before  the start of emission measurements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In consultation with the EPA, the FAA may approve alternative  procedures for measuring emissions, including testing and sampling  methods, analytical techniques, and equipment specifications that differ  from those specified in this part. Manufacturers and operators may  request approval of alternative procedures by written request with  supporting justification to the FAA Aircraft Certification Office and to  the Designated EPA Program Officer. To be approved, one of the following  conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The engine cannot be tested using the specified procedures; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The alternative procedure is shown to be equivalent to, or more  accurate or precise than, the specified procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The following landing and takeoff (LTO) cycles apply for  emissions testing and for calculating weighted LTO values:</p><p class="depth2">LTO Test Cycles and Time in Mode ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Class</p><p class="depth2">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Mode                            TP                    TF, T3, T8                    TSS</p><p class="depth2">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">TIM (min)     % of rO     TIM (min)     % of rO     TIM (min)     % of rO ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Taxi/idle.........................         26.0            7         26.0            7         26.0          5.8 Takeoff...........................          0.5          100          0.7          100          1.2          100 Climbout..........................          2.5           90          2.2           85          2.0           65 Descent...........................
