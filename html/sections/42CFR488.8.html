                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Performance review. In accordance with section 1875(b) of the  Act, CMS evaluates the performance of each CMS-approved accreditation  program on an ongoing basis. This review includes, but is not limited to  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review of the organization's survey activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Analysis of the results of the validation surveys under Sec.  488.9(a)(1), including the rate of disparity between certifications of  the accrediting organization and certifications of the SA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review of the organization's continued fulfillment of the  requirements in Sec. 488.5(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comparability review. CMS assesses the equivalency of an  accrediting organization's CMS-approved program requirements to the  comparable Medicare requirements if the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS imposes new Medicare certification requirements or changes  its survey process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> CMS provides written notice of the changes to the affected  accrediting organization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CMS specifies in its written notice a timeframe, not less than  30 calendar days from the date of the notice, for the accrediting  organization to submit its proposed equivalent changes, including its  implementation timeframe, for CMS review. CMS may extend the deadline  after due consideration of a written request for extension by the  accrediting organization, submitted prior to the original deadline.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After completing the comparability review CMS provides written  notification to the organization whether or not the accreditation  program, including the proposed revisions and implementation timeframe,  continues to meet or exceed all applicable Medicare requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If, no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of the  organization's proposed changes, CMS does not provide the written notice  to the organization required in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section,  then the revised program will be deemed to meet or exceed all applicable  Medicare requirements and to have continued CMS approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If an organization fails to submit its proposed changes within  the required timeframe, or fails to implement the proposed changes that  have been determined by CMS or deemed to be comparable, CMS may open an  accreditation program review in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An accrediting organization proposes to adopt new requirements  or to change its survey process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An accrediting organization must provide written notice to CMS  of any proposed changes in its accreditation requirements or survey  process and must not implement any changes before receiving CMS's  approval, except as provided below.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If, no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of the  organization's proposed changes, CMS does not provide written notice to  the organization that the accreditation program, including the proposed  revisions, continues or does not continue to meet or exceed all  applicable Medicare requirements, then the revised program will be  deemed to meet or exceed all applicable Medicare requirements and to  have continued CMS approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If an organization implements changes that have neither been  determined by CMS nor deemed to be comparable to the applicable Medicare  requirements, CMS may open an accreditation program review in accordance  with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> CMS-approved accreditation program review. If a comparability or  performance review reveals evidence of substantial non-compliance of an  accrediting organization's CMS-approved accreditation program with the  requirements of this subpart, CMS may initiate an accreditation program  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an accreditation program review is initiated, CMS provides  written notice to the organization indicating that its CMS-approved  accreditation program approval may be in jeopardy and that an  accreditation program review is being initiated. The notice provides all  of the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A statement of the instances, rates or patterns of non- compliance identified, as well as other related information, if  applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A description of the process to be followed during the review,  including a description of the opportunities for the accrediting  organization to offer factual information related to CMS's findings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the possible actions that may be imposed by  CMS based on the findings of the accreditation program review.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The actions the accrediting organization must take to address  the identified deficiencies including a timeline for implementation not  to exceed 180 calendar days after receipt of the notice that CMS is  initiating an accreditation program review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CMS reviews the accrediting organization's plan of correction  for acceptability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If CMS determines as a result of the accreditation program  review or a review of an application for renewal of an existing CMS- approved accreditation program that the accrediting organization has  failed to meet any of the requirements of this subpart, CMS may place  the accrediting organization's CMS-approved accreditation program on  probation for a period up to 180 calendar days to implement corrective  actions, not to exceed the accrediting organization's current term of  approval. In the case of a renewal application where CMS has placed the  accreditation program on probation, CMS indicates that any approval of  the application is conditional while the program is placed on probation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within 60 calendar days after the end of any probationary  period, CMS issues a written determination to the accrediting  organization as to whether or not a CMS-approved accreditation program  continues to meet the requirements of this subpart, including the  reasons for the determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If CMS has determined that the accrediting organization does  not meet the requirements, CMS withdraws approval of the CMS-approved  accreditation program. The notice of determination provided to the  accrediting organization includes notice of the removal of approval,  reason for the removal, including the effective date determined in  accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> CMS publishes in the Federal Register a notice of its decision  to withdraw approval of a CMS-approved accreditation program, including  the reasons for the withdrawal, effective 60 calendar days from the date  of publication of the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Immediate jeopardy. If at any time CMS determines that the  continued approval of a CMS-approved accreditation program of any  accrediting organization poses an immediate jeopardy to the patients of  the entities accredited under that program, or the continued approval  otherwise constitutes a significant hazard to the public health, CMS may  immediately withdraw the approval of a CMS-approved accreditation  program of that accrediting organization and publish a notice of the  removal, including the reasons for it, in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification of providers or suppliers. An accrediting  organization whose CMS approval of its accreditation program has been  withdrawn must notify, in writing, each of its accredited providers or  suppliers of the withdrawal of CMS approval and the implications in  accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section for the providers' or  suppliers' deemed status no later than 30 calendar days after the notice  is published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request for reconsideration. Any accrediting organization  dissatisfied with a determination to withdraw CMS approval of its  accreditation program may request a reconsideration of that  determination in accordance with subpart D of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Continuation of deemed status--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Involuntary termination.  After CMS removes approval of an accrediting organization's  accreditation program, an affected provider's or supplier's deemed   status continues in effect for 180 calendar days after the removal of  the approval if the provider or supplier submits an application to  another CMS-approved accreditation program within 60 calendar days from  the date of publication of the removal notice in the Federal Register.  The provider or supplier must also provide written notice to the SA that  it has submitted an application for accreditation under another CMS- approved accreditation program within this same 60-calendar day  timeframe. Failure to comply with the timeframe requirements specified  in this section will place the provider or supplier under the SAs  authority for continued participation in Medicare and on-going  monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Voluntary termination by accrediting organization. When an  accrediting organization has voluntarily terminated its CMS-approved  accreditation program and provides its accredited providers and  suppliers the notice required at Sec. 488.5(a)(17), an affected  provider's or supplier's deemed status continues in effect for 180  calendar days after the termination effective date if the provider or  supplier submits an application to another CMS-approved accreditation  program within 60 calendar days from the date of the notice from the  accrediting organization. The provider or supplier must also provide  written notice to the SA that it has submitted an application for  accreditation under another CMS-approved accreditation program within  this same 60-calendar day timeframe. Failure to comply with the  timeframe requirements specified in this section will place the provider  or supplier under the SAs authority for continued participation in  Medicare and on-going monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Onsite observations of accrediting organization operations. As  part of the application review process, the ongoing review process, or  the continuing oversight of an accrediting organization's performance,  CMS may conduct at any time an onsite inspection of the accrediting  organization's operations and offices to verify the organization's  representations and to assess the organization's compliance with its own  policies and procedures. The onsite inspection may include, but is not  limited to, the review of documents, auditing meetings concerning the  accreditation process, observation of surveys, the evaluation of survey  results or the accreditation decision-making process, and interviews  with the organization's staff.
