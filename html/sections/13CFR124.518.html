                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> contract for  default, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR  chapter 1). SBA will have no liability for termination costs or  reprocurement costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Termination for convenience. After consulting with SBA, the  procuring activity contracting officer may terminate an 8(a) contract  for convenience when it is in the best interests of the Government to do  so. A termination for convenience is appropriate if any   disadvantaged owner of the Participant performing the contract  relinquishes ownership or control of such concern, or enters into any  agreement to relinquish such ownership or control, unless a waiver is  granted pursuant to Sec. 124.515.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Substitution of one 8(a) contractor for another. Where a  procuring activity contracting officer demonstrates to SBA that an 8(a)  contract will otherwise be terminated for default, SBA may authorize  another Participant to complete performance and, in conjunction with the  procuring activity, permit novation of the contract without invoking the  termination for convenience or waiver provisions of Sec. 124.515.</p>
