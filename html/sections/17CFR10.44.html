                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When permitted. If it appears that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A prospective witness will be unable to attend or testify at a  hearing on the basis of age, illness, infirmity, imprisonment or on the  basis that he is or will be outside of the United States at the time of  the hearing (unless it appears that the absence of the witness was  procured by the party seeking to take the deposition),</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> His testimony is material,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is necessary to take his deposition in the interest of  Justice, the Administrative Law Judge may by order   direct that his deposition be taken either orally or in the form of  written interrogatories, and may issue a subpoena to compel the  attendance of the witness for deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for deposition. Any party desiring to take the  deposition of a witness shall make application in writing to the  Administrative Law Judge for an order to take deposition. In addition to  the showing required in Sec. 10.44(a), the application shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and post office address of the witness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific matters concerning which the witness is expected to  testify and their relevance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reasons why the deposition should be taken, supported by  affidavits and a physician's certificate, where appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The time when, the place where, and the name and address of the  person before whom the deposition is to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A specification of the documents and materials which the  deponent is requested to produce;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Application for any subpoenas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Service and reply. A copy of the application to take deposition  shall be served upon every other party to the proceeding and upon the  person sought to be deposed. Any party or the deponent may serve and  file an opposition to the application within seven days after the  application is filed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time when, place where, and officer before whom deposition is  taken--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the deposition is taken. Unless otherwise ordered or  agreed to by stipulation, depositions shall be taken in the city or  municipality where the deponent is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Officer before whom taken. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within the United States or a  territory of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an  officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States  or of the place where the examination is held.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within a foreign country, depositions may be taken before an  officer or person designated by the Administrative Law Judge or agreed  upon by the parties by a stipulation in writing to be filed with the  Proceedings Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures for taking oral depositions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Oral examination and  crossexamination of witnesses shall be conducted in a manner similar to  that permitted at a formal hearing. All questions and testimony shall be  recorded verbatim, except to the extent that all parties present or  represented may agree that a matter shall be off the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All objections made at the time of the examination to the  qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of  taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party,  or any other objection to the proceeding shall be noted by the officer  upon the deposition, and shall subsequently be determined by the  Administrative Law Judge. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to  the objections. However, the parties may stipulate that, except as to  objections to the form of questions, all objections to the matters  testified to in a deposition are preserved for the hearing, whether or  not raised at the time of deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the taking of a deposition a party or deponent may  request and obtain an adjournment to permit an application to be made to  the Administrative Law Judge for an order suspending the deposition on  grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, annoyance,  embarrassment, oppression of a deponent or party, or improper questions.  An attorney who requests and obtains an adjournment for this purpose but  fails, without good cause, promptly to apply for relief to the  Administrative Law Judge may be found guilty of contemptuous conduct in  accordance with Sec. 10.11(b) of these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedures for use of interrogatories. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If depositions are to  be taken and submitted on written interrogatories, the interrogatories  shall be filed in triplicate with the application for deposition and  served on the parties. Within ten days after service, any party may  file, in triplicate, with the Proceedings Clerk, his objections, if any,  to such interrogatories and may file such cross-interrogatories as he  desires to submit. Other parties shall have ten days to file their  objections to cross-interrogatories. Objections shall be settled by the  Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories and  cross-interrogatories, no party shall be present or represented and no  person other than the witness, a stenographic reporter, and the officer  shall be present. The officer shall propound the interrogatories and  cross-interrogatories to the witness, and the interrogatories and  responses thereto shall be transcribed and reduced to writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Use of depositions at hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any part or all of a  deposition, to the extent admissible under rules of evidence applied as  though the witness were then present and testifying at the hearing, may  be used against any party who had reasonable notice of the taking of the  deposition, if the Administrative Law Judge finds that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The witness is dead;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age,  illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The witness is out of the United States at the time of the  hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured  by the party offering the deposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party,  an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought  in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may  introduce any other parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Objection may be made at a hearing to receiving in evidence any  deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the  exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and  testifying.  [41 FR 2511, Jan. 16, 1976, as amended at 60 FR 54802, Oct. 26, 1995]</p>
