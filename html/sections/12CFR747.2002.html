                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of intent to issue directive--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally. Whenever the  NCUA Board intends to issue a directive imposing a discretionary  supervisory action under Secs. 702.202(b), 702.203(b) and 702.204(b) of  this chapter on a credit union classified ``undercapitalized'' or lower,  or under Sec. 702.304(b) or Sec. 702.305(b) of this chapter on a new  credit union classified ``moderately capitalized'' or lower, it must  give the credit union prior notice of the proposed action and an  opportunity to respond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Immediate issuance of directive without notice. The NCUA Board  may issue a directive to take effect immediately under paragraph (a)(1)  of this section without notice to the credit union if the NCUA Board  finds it necessary in order to carry out the purposes of part 702 of  this chapter. A credit union that is subject to a directive which takes  effect immediately may appeal the directive in writing to the NCUA  Board. Such an appeal must be received by the NCUA Board within 14  calendar days after the directive was issued, unless the NCUA Board  permits a longer period. Unless ordered by the NCUA Board, the directive  shall remain in effect pending a decision on the appeal. The NCUA Board  shall consider any such appeal, if timely filed, within 60 calendar days  of receiving it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of notice. The NCUA Board's notice to a credit union of  its intention to issue a directive imposing a discretionary supervisory  action must state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The credit union's net worth ratio and net worth category  classification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The specific restrictions or requirements that the NCUA Board  intends to impose, and the reasons therefor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed date when the discretionary supervisory action  would take effect and the proposed date for completing the required  action or terminating the action; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That a credit union must file a written response to a notice  within 14 calendar days from the date of the notice, or within such  shorter period as the NCUA Board determines is appropriate in light of  the financial condition of the credit union or other relevant  circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of response to notice. A credit union's response to a  notice under paragraph (b) of this section must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Explain why it contends that the proposed discretionary  supervisory action is not an appropriate exercise of discretion under  this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request the NCUA Board to modify or to not issue the proposed  directive;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Include other relevant information, mitigating circumstances,  documentation, or other evidence in support of the credit union's  position regarding the proposed directive; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If desired, request the recommendation of NCUA's ombudsman  pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> NCUA Board consideration of response. The NCUA Board, or an  independent person designated by the NCUA Board to act on its behalf,  after considering a response under paragraph (c) of this section, may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Issue the directive as originally proposed or as modified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine not to issue the directive and to so notify the credit  union; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Seek additional information or clarification from the credit  union or any other relevant source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to file response. A credit union which fails to file a  written response to a notice of the NCUA Board's intention to issue a  directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action, within the  specified time period, shall be deemed to have waived the opportunity to  respond, and to have consented to the issuance of the directive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Request to modify or rescind directive. A credit union that is  subject to an existing directive imposing a discretionary supervisory  action may request in writing that the NCUA Board reconsider the terms  of the directive, or rescind or modify it, due to changed circumstances.  Unless otherwise ordered by the NCUA Board, the directive shall remain  in effect while such request is pending. A request under this paragraph  which remains pending 60 days following receipt by the NCUA Board is  deemed granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ombudsman. A credit union may request in writing the  recommendation of NCUA's ombudsman to modify or to not issue a proposed  directive under paragraph (b) of this section, or to modify or rescind  an existing directive due to changed circumstances under paragraph (f)  of this section. A credit union which fails to request the ombudsman's  recommendation in a response under paragraph (c) of this section, or in  a request under paragraph (f) of this section, shall be deemed to have  waived the opportunity to do so. The ombudsman shall promptly notify the  credit union and the NCUA Board of his or her recommendation.</p>
