                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> except insofar as the loss is  recognized under Sec. 1.1002-1 upon the sale or exchange of the stock  and except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.165-5 with respect to stock  which becomes worthless during the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stock owned by banks. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the regulation of banks and certain  other corporations, Federal and State authorities may require that stock  owned by such organizations be charged off as worthless or written down  to a nominal value. If, in any such case, this requirement is premised  upon the worthlessness of the stock, the charging off or writing down  will be considered prima facie evidence of worthlessness for purposes of  section 165(a); but, if the charging off or writing down is due to a  fluctuation in the market price of the stock or if no reasonable attempt  to determine the worthlessness of the stock has been made, then no  deduction shall be allowed under section 165(a) for the amount so  charged off or written down.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This paragraph shall not be construed, however, to permit a  deduction under section 165(a) unless the stock owned by the bank or  other corporation actually becomes worthless in the   taxable year. Such a taxpayer owning stock which becomes worthless  during the taxable year is not precluded from deducting the loss under  section 165(a) merely because, in obedience to the specific orders or  general policy of such supervisory authorities, the value of the stock  is written down to a nominal amount instead of being charged off  completely.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application to inventories. This section does not apply to a  decline in the value of corporate stock reflected in inventories  required to be taken by a dealer in securities under section 471. See  Sec. 1.471-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definition. As used in this section, the term ``stock'' means a  share of stock in a corporation or a right to subscribe for, or to  receive, a share of stock in a corporation.</p>
