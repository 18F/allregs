In accepting a permit, you agree to be fully liable for any damage or injury incurred in connection with the permitted activity, and to indemnify and hold harmless the United States of America as a result of your actions. We may require you to obtain property damage, personal injury, commercial liability or public liability insurance in an amount sufficient to protect the United States from liability or other claims arising from activities under the permit. The insurance policy must name the United States of America as an additional insured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bond. You are responsible for all response, repair and restoration if your activity causes damage to an area. We may also require you to provide a bond or other security sufficient to secure any obligations you may have under the permit and applicable laws and regulations, including the cost of repair, reclamation, or restoration of the area. The amount of the bond or security must be in an amount sufficient to provide full payment for the costs of response and restoration, reclamation, or rehabilitation of the lands in the event that you fail to adequately repair, reclaim, or restore the area as directed by the agency. If the amount of the bond or other security is inadequate to cover cost of the repair, reclamation, or restoration of the damaged lands or resources you will also be responsible for the additional amount.</p>
