                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Form of authorization. The Treasury does not prescribe the form  or type of instructions an agent must obtain from each owner, co-owner  or beneficiary in order to use the special endorsement procedure. In the  case of eligible Series E and EE savings bonds and savings notes  presented for a redemption-exchange, the owner, coowner or beneficiary  authorized to request the exchange (as specified in Circular No. 750,  Sec. 321.8(b)), must sign the exchange subscription even though the  eligible Series E and EE savings bonds and savings notes are specially  endorsed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Securities in coownership or beneficiary form. Securities  registered in coownership or beneficiary form should be accepted for  special endorsement only for immediate payment or exchange. Acceptance  of bonds and notes for processing at some future date should be avoided  as authority to utilize such endorsement generally expires upon the  death of the owner or coowner on whose behalf securities were to be  paid. Requests for payment of securities present by the surviving  beneficiary must be supported by a certificate of death for the owner  named thereon, as required by Circular No. 750, part 321 and the  appendix to that part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Record of authorization. Agents should maintain such records as  may be necessary to establish the receipt of, and compliance with,  instructions supporting the special endorsement. If the agent elects to  make notations on the backs of the securities to serve as a record, the  Bureau of the Fiscal Service will undertake to produce, on request,  photocopies of such securities at any time up to ten years after the  redemption date. However, the Bureau does not not assume responsibility  for the adequacy of such notations, for the legibility of any photocopy,  or for failure to produce a photocopy from its records.
