                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn statement of a witness who is not a party to the proceeding, that is otherwise admissible in the proceeding, may make a motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If only part of a statement is offered in evidence, the Administrative Law Judge may require that all relevant portions of the statement be introduced. If all of a statement is offered in evidence, the Administrative Law Judge may require that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A motion to introduce a prior sworn statement may be granted if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The witness is dead;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior sworn statement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, it would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior sworn statement to be used. In making this determination, due regard shall be given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in an open hearing. If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn statement in lieu of live testimony, consideration shall also be given to the convenience of the parties in avoiding unnecessary expense.</p>
