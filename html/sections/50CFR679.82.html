A rockfish eligible harvester that receives an initial allocation of aggregate rockfish QS that exceeds the use cap listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not receive any rockfish QS by transfer (except by operation of law) unless and until that harvester's holdings of aggregate rockfish QS in that sector are reduced to an amount below the use cap specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Opt-out. Any vessel named on an LLP license that is not named on an approved Annual Application for Cooperative Fishing Quota, may not fish with any vessel named on the opted-out LLP license during that fishing year in any directed fishery for any rockfish primary species in the Central GOA and waters adjacent to the Central GOA when the rockfish primary species caught by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC specified under Sec. 679.20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Sideboard limitations--General. The regulations in this section restrict the vessels and holders of LLP licenses with rockfish legal landings that could generate rockfish QS from using the increased flexibility provided by the Rockfish Program to expand their level of participation in other GOA groundfish fisheries. These limitations are commonly known as ``sideboards.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Classes of sideboard restrictions. Three types of sideboard restrictions apply under the Rockfish Program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Catcher vessel sideboard restrictions as described under paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catcher/processor rockfish sideboard restrictions as described under paragraph (e) of this section; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Opt-out sideboard restrictions as described under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notification of affected vessel owners and LLP license holders. After NMFS determines which vessels and LLP licenses may be subject to sideboard limitations as described in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, NMFS will inform each vessel owner and LLP license holder in writing of the type of rockfish sideboard limitation and issue a revised Federal Fisheries Permit and/or LLP license that displays the sideboard limitation(s) that may apply to that FFP or LLP on its face.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appeals. A vessel owner or LLP license holder who believes that NMFS has incorrectly identified his or her vessel or LLP license as meeting the criteria for a sideboard limitation, or who disagrees with the specific sideboard ratio assigned to that LLP license, may make a contrary claim and provide evidence to NMFS. All claims must be submitted in writing with any documentation or evidence supporting the request within 30 days of being notified by NMFS of the sideboard limitation. NMFS will provide instructions for submitting such claims with the sideboard notification. An applicant must submit any documentation or evidence supporting a claim within 30 days of being notified by NMFS of the sideboard limitation. If NMFS finds the claim is unsupported, the claim will be denied in an Initial Administrative Determination (IAD). The affected persons may appeal this IAD using the procedures described in Sec. 679.43.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Duration of sideboard limits. Unless otherwise specified, all sideboard limitations established under paragraph (e) of this section only apply from July 1 through July 31 of each year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sideboard provisions for catcher vessels--(1) Vessels subject to catcher vessel sideboard limits. Any vessel not specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessels subject to catcher vessel sideboard limits. Any vessel not specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any vessel whose rockfish legal landings could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher vessel sector; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority rockfish legal landings were made that could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher vessel sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Applicability of sideboard provisions for specific catcher vessels. The following vessels are exempt from the sideboard limits in paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any AFA catcher vessel that is not exempt from GOA groundfish sideboards under the AFA as specified under Sec. 679.64(b)(2)(ii);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any vessel that made rockfish legal landings during the fishery seasons established in Table 28a to this part and during the entry level trawl fishery during 2007, 2008, or 2009 established in Table 28b to this part and that is designated on an approved application for rockfish QS as being excluded from the Rockfish Program as specified under Sec. 679.80(d)(4)(ii); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority rockfish legal landings were made during the fishery seasons established in Table 28a to this part and during the entry level trawl fishery during 2007, 2008, or 2009 established in Table 28b to this part if that LLP license is designated on an approved application for rockfish QS as being excluded from the Rockfish Program as specified under Sec. 679.80(d)(4)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prohibition for directed fishing in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District rockfish fishery during July. Vessels subject to the provisions in this paragraph (d) may not participate in directed fishing in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District for northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and pelagic shelf rockfish (or in waters adjacent to the Western GOA and West Yakutat District when northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and pelagic shelf rockfish by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC as specified under Sec. 679.20) from July 1 through July 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prohibition for directed fishing in the specific GOA flatfish fisheries during July. Vessels subject to the provisions in this paragraph (d) may not participate in directed fishing for arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, and rex sole in the GOA (or in waters adjacent to the GOA when arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, and rex sole caught by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC as specified under Sec. 679.20) from July 1 through July 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rockfish and halibut PSC sideboard provisions for catcher/processor vessels--(1) Vessels subject to catcher/processor sideboard limits. Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessels subject to catcher/processor sideboard limits. Any vessel that NMFS has determined meets any of the following criteria is subject to the provisions under this paragraph (e):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any vessel whose rockfish legal landings could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any vessel named on an LLP license under whose authority rockfish legal landings were made that could be used to generate rockfish QS for the catcher/processor sector in the Rockfish Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibition for directed rockfish fishing in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District by non-Amendment 80 vessels assigned to the catcher/processor sector. Any vessel that meets the criteria established in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and that is not an Amendment 80 vessel is prohibited from directed fishing for northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and pelagic shelf rockfish in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District (or in waters adjacent to the Western GOA and West Yakutat District when northern rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and pelagic shelf rockfish by that vessel is deducted from the Federal TAC as specified under Sec. 679.20) from July 1 through July 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculation of rockfish and halibut PSC sideboard limits assigned to each LLP license in the catcher/processor sector. NMFS will determine specific rockfish sideboard ratios for each LLP license assigned to the catcher/processor sector that could generate rockfish QS. These rockfish sideboard ratios will be noted on the face of an LLP license and will be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each rockfish sideboard fishery, divide the retained catch of that rockfish sideboard fishery from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 made under the authority of that LLP license, by the total retained catch of that rockfish sideboard fishery from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 by vessels operating under the authority of all eligible LLP licenses in the catcher/processor sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the deep-water halibut PSC sideboard limit, divide the halibut PSC used in the deep-water complex, except in the Central GOA rockfish fisheries, from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 under the authority of that LLP license, by the total deep-water halibut PSC used from July 1 through July 31 in each year

from 2000 through 2006 by vessels operating under the authority of all LLP licenses in the catcher/processor sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For the shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limit, divide the halibut PSC used in the shallow-water complex from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 under the authority of that LLP license, by the total shallow-water halibut PSC used from July 1 through July 31 in each year from 2000 through 2006 by vessels operating under the authority of all LLP licenses in the catcher/processor sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Western GOA and West Yakutat District rockfish sideboard ratios. The rockfish sideboard ratio for each rockfish fishery in the Western GOA and West Yakutat District is established in the following table:

Each rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector will be assigned a portion of the rockfish sideboard limit for each rockfish species established in paragraph (e)(4) of this section according to the following formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each rockfish sideboard fishery specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, sum the rockfish sideboard ratios of all LLP licenses as calculated under paragraph (e)(3) of this section assigned to that rockfish cooperative and multiply this result by the amount of TAC (in metric tons) assigned to that rockfish sideboard fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Once assigned, a catcher/processor rockfish cooperative may not exceed any rockfish sideboard limit assigned to that cooperative from July 1 through July 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Assigning a rockfish sideboard limit to catcher/processors that opt-out of participating in rockfish cooperatives. Holders of catcher/processor designated LLP licenses that opt-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative will receive the portion of each rockfish sideboard limit established in paragraph (e)(3) of this section not assigned to rockfish cooperatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Management of a rockfish opt-out sideboard limit. (i) If the Regional Administrator determines that an annual rockfish sideboard limit for opt-out vessels is sufficient to support directed fishing for that rockfish sideboard fishery, the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing allowance applicable to holders of catcher/processor designated LLPs that have opted-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the Regional Administrator determines that an annual rockfish sideboard limit for opt-out vessels is sufficient to support directed fishing for that rockfish sideboard fishery, the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing allowance applicable to holders of catcher/processor designated LLPs that have opted-out of participating in a rockfish cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the Regional Administrator determines that a sideboard limit is insufficient to support a directed fishing allowance for that rockfish sideboard fishery, then the Regional Administrator may not allow directed fishing and set the allowance to zero for catcher/processor opt-out vessels from July 1 through July 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon determining that a halibut PSC sideboard limit is or will be reached, the Regional Administrator will publish notification in the Federal Register prohibiting directed fishing for the rockfish sideboard fishery in the regulatory area or district for catcher/processor opt-out vessels that will be effective from July 1 through July 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Assigning deep-water and shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limits to a rockfish cooperative. Each rockfish cooperative in the catcher/processor sector will be assigned a percentage of the deep-water and shallow-water halibut

PSC sideboard limits based on the following calculation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sum the deep-water ratios of all LLP licenses assigned to that rockfish cooperative and multiply this result by the amount set out in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sum the shallow-water ratios of all LLP licenses assigned to that rockfish cooperative and multiply this result by the amount set out in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A rockfish cooperative may not exceed any deep-water or shallow-water halibut PSC sideboard limit assigned to that cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Assigning a halibut PSC limit to catcher/processor opt-out vessels.
