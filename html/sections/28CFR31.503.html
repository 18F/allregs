                            <p class="depth0">The mechanism for a State to report on the proposed use of funds by  the State or by a subgrantee unit of local government is by electronic  submission of a ``Follow Up Information Form'' to be provided to each  participating State. The purpose of this report is for the State to  provide assurances to OJJDP that funds expended by the State and its  subgrantee units of local government will be used for authorized program  purpose areas. Although no actual program descriptions will be required,  information about the distribution of funds among the authorized program  purpose areas must be provided. Upon receipt and review of the ``Follow  Up Information Form'' by OJJDP, States may obligate program funds  retained for expenditure at the State level. Similarly, the State shall  require that each recipient unit of local government submit its proposed  use of non-administrative funds to the State prior to drawdown of  subgrant funds to implement local programs and projects. Upon receipt  and review of the local unit of government's proposed fund use, the  State shall authorize the local unit of government to obligate local  subgrant funds. The State shall electronically submit a copy of the  local subgrant information to OJJDP, as provided in the award package,  within 30 days of the date that the local unit of government is  authorized to obligate program funds under its subgrant award.</p>
