                            <p class="depth0">To find out where to send your submission, visit our Web site at  http://www.pbgc.gov, see the instructions to our forms, or call our  Customer Service Center (1-800-400-7242 for participants, or 1-800-736- 2444 for practitioners; TTY/TDD users may call the Federal relay service  toll-free at 1-800-877-8339 and ask to be connected to the appropriate  number.) Because we have different addresses for different types of  filings, you should make sure to use the appropriate address for your  type of filing. For example, some filings (such as premium payments)  must be sent to a specified bank, while other filings (such as the  Standard Termination Notice (Form 500)) must be sent to the appropriate  department at our offices in Washington, DC. You do not have to address  electronic submissions made through our Web site. We are responsible for  ensuring that such submissions go to the proper place.
