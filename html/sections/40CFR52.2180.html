NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1224 (DC Cir. 1988). In a letter to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, dated May 11, 1988, Joel C. Smith, Administrator, Office of Air Quality and Solid Waste, stated:</p><p class="depth0">``* * * We are submitting this letter to allow EPA to continue to process our current SIP submittal with the understanding that if EPA's response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985 regulations, EPA will notify the State of the rules that must be changed to comport with the EPA's modified requirements. The State of South Dakota agrees to make the appropriate changes.''
