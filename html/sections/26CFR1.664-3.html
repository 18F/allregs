                                Sec. 1.664-3  Charitable remainder unitrust.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description. A charitable remainder unitrust is a trust which  complies with the applicable provisions of Sec. 1.664-1 and meets all  of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)(a)</em> is applicable for  taxable years ending after April 18, 1997.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)(a)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An amount of trust income for a taxable year that is in excess  of the amount required to be distributed under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of  this section for such year to the extent that (by reason of paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(b)(1) of this section) the aggregate of the amounts paid in  prior years was less than the aggregate of such required amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b), trust income  generally means income as defined under section 643(b) and the  applicable regulations. However, trust income may not be determined by  reference to a fixed percentage of the annual fair market value of the  trust property, notwithstanding any contrary provision in applicable  state law. Proceeds from the sale or exchange of any assets contributed  to the trust by the donor must be allocated to principal and not to  trust income at least to the extent of the fair market value of those  assets on the date of their contribution to the trust. Proceeds from the  sale or exchange of any assets purchased by the trust must be allocated  to principal and not to trust income at least to the extent of the  trust's purchase price of those assets. Except as provided in the two  preceding sentences, proceeds from the sale or exchange of any assets  contributed to the trust by the donor or   purchased by the trust may be allocated to income, pursuant to the terms  of the governing instrument, if not prohibited by applicable local law.  A discretionary power to make this allocation may be granted to the  trustee under the terms of the governing instrument but only to the  extent that the state statute permits the trustee to make adjustments  between income and principal to treat beneficiaries impartially.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The rules in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b)(1) and (2) of this section  are applicable for taxable years ending after April 18, 1997. The rule  in the first sentence of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b)(3) is applicable for  taxable years ending after April 18, 1997. The rules in the second,  fourth, and fifth sentences of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b)(3) are applicable  for taxable years ending after January 2, 2004. The rule in the third  sentence of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b)(3) is applicable for sales or  exchanges that occur after April 18, 1997. The rule in the sixth  sentence of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b)(3) is applicable for trusts created  after January 2, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Combination of methods. Instead of the amount described in  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) or (b) of this section, the governing instrument  may provide that the trust will pay not less often than annually the  amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section for an  initial period and then pay the amount described in paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section (calculated using the same fixed  percentage) for the remaining years of the trust only if the governing  instrument provides that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)(a)</em> of  this section is triggered on a specific date or by a single event whose  occurrence is not discretionary with, or within the control of, the  trustees or any other persons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The change from the method prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b)  of this section to the method prescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of  this section occurs at the beginning of the taxable year that  immediately follows the taxable year during which the date or event  specified under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c)(1) of this section occurs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Following the trust's conversion to the method described in  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section, the trust will pay at least  annually to the permissible recipients the amount described only in  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section and not any amount described in  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Triggering event. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c)(1) of  this section, a triggering event based on the sale of unmarketable  assets as defined in Sec. 1.664-1(a)(7)(ii), or the marriage, divorce,  death, or birth of a child with respect to any individual will not be  considered discretionary with, or within the control of, the trustees or  any other persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section. For each example, assume that  the governing instrument of charitable remainder unitrust Y provides  that Y will initially pay not less often than annually the amount  described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section and then pay the  amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section (calculated  using the same fixed percentage) for the remaining years of the trust  and that the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(c)(2) and (3) of this  section are satisfied. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Y is funded with the donor's former personal residence.  The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in method for  computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of the year  following the year in which the trust sells the residence. Y provides  for a combination of methods that satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Y is funded with cash and an unregistered security for  which there is no available exemption permitting public sale under the  Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The governing instrument of Y  provides that the change in method for computing the annual unitrust  amount is triggered on the earlier of the date when the stock is sold or  at the time the restrictions on its public sale lapse or are otherwise  lifted. Y provides for a combination of methods that satisfies paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Y is funded with cash and with a security that may be  publicly traded under the Securities and Exchange Commission   rules. The governing instrument of Y provides that the change in method  for computing the annual unitrust amount is triggered when the stock is  sold. Y does not provide for a combination of methods that satisfies the  requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section because the sale  of the publicly-traded stock is within the discretion of the trustee.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. S establishes Y for her granddaughter, G, when G is 10  years old. The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in  method for computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of  the year following the year in which G turns 18 years old. Y provides  for a combination of methods that satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in  method for computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of  the year following the year in which the donor is married. Y provides  for a combination of methods that satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The governing instrument of Y provides that if the donor  divorces, the change in method for computing the annual unitrust amount  will occur as of the first day of the year following the year of the  divorce. Y provides for a combination of methods that satisfies  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in  method for computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of  the year following the year in which the noncharitable beneficiary's  first child is born. Y provides for a combination of methods that  satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in  method for computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of  the year following the year in which the noncharitable beneficiary's  father dies. Y provides for a combination of methods that satisfies  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in  method for computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of  the year following the year in which the noncharitable beneficiary's  financial advisor determines that the beneficiary should begin receiving  payments under the second prescribed payment method. Because the change  in methods for paying the unitrust amount is triggered by an event that  is within a person's control, Y does not provide for a combination of  methods that satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. The governing instrument of Y provides for the change in  method for computing the annual unitrust amount as of the first day of  the year following the year in which the noncharitable beneficiary  submits a request to the trustee that the trust convert to the second  prescribed payment method. Because the change in methods for paying the  unitrust amount is triggered by an event that is within a person's  control, Y does not provide for a combination of methods that satisfies  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date--(1) General rule. Paragraphs (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)(c)</em>, (d),  and (e) of this section are applicable for charitable remainder trusts  created on or after December 10, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General rule regarding reformations of combination of method  unitrusts. If a trust is created on or after December 10, 1998, and  contains a provision allowing a change in calculating the unitrust  amount that does not comply with the provisions of paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section, the trust will qualify as a charitable  remainder unitrust only if it is amended or reformed to use the initial  method for computing the unitrust amount throughout the term of the  trust, or is reformed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(f)(3) of  this section. If a trust was created before December 10, 1998, and  contains a provision allowing a change in calculating the unitrust  amount that does not comply with the provisions of paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section, the trust may be reformed to use the  initial method for computing the unitrust amount throughout the term of  the trust without causing the trust to fail to function exclusively as a  charitable remainder unitrust under Sec. 1.664-1(a)(4), or may be  reformed in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(f)(3) of this section.  Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(f)(3) of this section, a  qualified charitable remainder unitrust will not continue to qualify as  a charitable remainder unitrust if it is amended or reformed to add a  provision allowing a change in the method for calculating the unitrust  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for reformations of trusts that begin by June 8,  1999. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)(i)(f)(2) of this section, if a  trust either provides for payment of the unitrust amount under a  combination of methods that is not permitted under paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section, or provides for payment of the unitrust  amount under only the method prescribed in   paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section, then the trust may be reformed  to allow for a combination of methods permitted under paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section without causing the trust to fail to  function exclusively as a charitable remainder unitrust under Sec.  1.664-1(a)(4) or to engage in an act of self-dealing under section 4941  if the trustee begins legal proceedings to reform by June 8, 1999. The  triggering event under the reformed governing instrument may not occur  in a year prior to the year in which the court issues the order  reforming the trust, except for situations in which the governing  instrument prior to reformation already provided for payment of the  unitrust amount under a combination of methods that is not permitted  under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(c) of this section and the triggering event  occurred prior to the reformation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Payment under general rule for fixed percentage trusts. When the  unitrust amount is computed under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of this  section, a trust will not be deemed to have engaged in an act of self- dealing (within the meaning of section 4941), to have unrelated debt- financed income (within the meaning of section 514), to have received an  additional contribution (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this  section), or to have failed to function exclusively as a charitable  remainder trust (within the meaning of Sec. 1.664-1(a)(4)) merely  because the unitrust amount is paid after the close of the taxable year  if such payment is made within a reasonable time after the close of such  taxable year and the entire unitrust amount in the hands of the  recipient is characterized only as income from the categories described  in section 664(b)(1), (2), or (3), except to the extent it is  characterized as corpus described in section 664(b)(4) because--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The trust pays the unitrust amount by distributing property  (other than cash) that it owned at the close of the taxable year, and  the trustee elects to treat any income generated by the distribution as  occurring on the last day of the taxable year in which the unitrust  amount is due;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The trust pays the unitrust amount by distributing cash that was  contributed to the trust (with respect to which a deduction was  allowable under section 170, 2055, 2106, or 2522); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The trust pays the unitrust amount by distributing cash received  as a return of basis in any asset that was contributed to the trust  (with respect to which a deduction was allowable under section 170,  2055, 2106, or 2522), and that is sold by the trust during the year for  which the unitrust amount is due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Special rule for fixed percentage trusts created before December  10, 1998. When the unitrust amount is computed under paragraph  (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section, a trust created before December 10, 1998,  will not be deemed to have engaged in an act of self-dealing (within the  meaning of section 4941), to have unrelated debt-financed income (within  the meaning of section 514), to have received an additional contribution  (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section), or to have failed  to function exclusively as a charitable remainder trust (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.664-1(a)(4)) merely because the unitrust amount is  paid after the close of the taxable year if such payment is made within  a reasonable time after the close of such taxable year and the fixed  percentage to be paid each year as the unitrust amount is 15 percent or  less of the net fair market value of the trust assets as determined  under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(g)</em> of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example. X is a charitable remainder unitrust that calculates the  unitrust amount under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section. X was  created after December 10, 1998. The prorated unitrust amount payable  from X for Year 1 is $100. The trustee does not pay the unitrust amount  to the recipient by the end of the Year 1. At the end of Year 1, X has  only $95 in the ordinary income category under section 664(b)(1) and no  income in the capital gain or tax-exempt income categories under section  664(b) (2) or (3), respectively. By April 15 of Year 2, in addition to  $95 in cash, the trustee distributes to the unitrust recipient a capital  asset with a $5 fair market value and a $2 adjusted basis to pay the  $100 unitrust amount due for Year 1. The trust owned the asset at the  end of Year 1. Under Sec. 1.664-1(d)(5), the distribution is treated as  a sale by X, resulting in X recognizing a $3 capital gain. The trustee  elects to treat the capital gain as occurring on the last day   of Year 1. Under Sec. 1.664-1(d)(1), the character of the unitrust  amount for Year 1 in the recipient's hands is $95 of ordinary income, $3  of capital gain income, and $2 of trust corpus. For Year 1, X satisfied  paragraph (a)(1)(i)(g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Payment under income exception. When the unitrust amount is  computed under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section, a trust will not  be deemed to have engaged in an act of self-dealing (within the meaning  of section 4941), to have unrelated debt-financed income (within the  meaning of section 514), to have received an additional contribution  (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section), or to have failed  to function exclusively as a charitable remainder trust (within the  meaning of Sec. 1.664-1(a)(4)) merely because payment of the unitrust  amount is made after the close of the taxable year if such payment is  made within a reasonable time after the close of such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Reasonable time. For paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (g), (h), and (j) of  this section, a reasonable time will not ordinarily extend beyond the  date by which the trustee is required to file Form 5227, ``Split- Interest Trust Information Return,'' (including extensions) for the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k)  of this section are applicable for taxable years ending after April 18,  1997. Paragraphs (a)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(g)(2)</em> and (3) apply only to distributions  made on or after January 5, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of fixed percentage. The fixed percentage may be  expressed either as a fraction or as a percentage and must be payable  each year in the period specified in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph.  A percentage is fixed if the percentage is the same either as to each  recipient or as to the total percentage payable each year of such  period. For example, provision for a fixed percentage which is the same  every year to A until his death and concurrently a fixed percentage  which is the same every year to B until his death, the fixed percentage  to each recipient to terminate at his death, would satisfy the rule.  Similarly, provision for a fixed percentage to A and B for their joint  lives and then to the survivor would satisfy the rule. In the case of a  distribution to an organization described in section 170(c) at the death  of a recipient or the expiration of a term of years, the governing  instrument may provide for a reduction of the fixed percentage payable  after such distribution Provided That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The reduced fixed percentage is the same either as to each  recipient or as to the total amount payable for each year of the balance  of such period, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph are  met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rules applicable to incorrect valuations. The governing  instrument provides that in the case where the net fair market value of  the trust assets is incorrectly determined by the fiduciary, the trust  shall pay to the recipient (in the case of an undervaluation) or be  repaid by the recipient (in the case of an overvaluation) an amount  equal to the difference between the amount which the trust should have  paid the recipient if the correct value were used and the amount which  the trust actually paid the recipient. Such payments or repayments must  be made within a reasonable period after the final determination of such  value. Any payment due to a recipient by reason of such incorrect  valuation shall be considered to be a payment required to be distributed  at the time of such final determination for purposes of paragraph  (d)(4)(ii) of Sec. 1.664-1. See paragraph (d)(4) of Sec. 1.664-1 for  rules relating to the year of inclusion of such payments and the  allowance of a deduction for such repayments. See paragraph (b) of this  section for rules relating to additional contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rules applicable to valuation. In computing the net fair market  value of the trust assets there shall be taken into account all assets  and liabilities without regard to whether particular items are taken  into account in determining the income of the trust. The net fair market  value of the trust assets may be determined on any one date during the  taxable year of the trust, or by taking the average of valuations made  on more than one date during the taxable year of the trust, so long as  the same valuation date or dates and valuation methods are used each  year. If the governing instrument   does not specify the valuation date or dates, the trustee must select  such date or dates and indicate the selection on the first return on  Form 5227, ``Split-Interest Trust Information Return,'' that the trust  must file. The amount described in subdivision (i)(a) of this  subparagraph which must be paid each year must be based upon the  valuation for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Computation of unitrust amount in certain circumstances--(a)  Short taxable years. The governing instrument provides that, in the case  of a taxable year which is for a period of less than 12 months other  than the taxable year in which occurs the end of the period specified in  subparagraph (5) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount determined under subdivision (i)(a) of this  subparagraph shall be the amount otherwise determined under that  subdivision multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the  number of days in the taxable year of the trust and the denominator of  which is 365 (366 if February 29 is a day included in the numerator),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount determined under subdivision (i)(b) of this  subparagraph shall be computed by using the amount determined under  subdivision (a)(1) of this subdivision (v), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If no valuation date occurs before the end of the taxable year  of the trust, the trust assets shall be valued as of the last day of the  taxable year of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Last taxable year of period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The governing instrument  provides that, in the case of the taxable year in which occurs the end  of the period specified in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(a)</em> of this subparagraph shall be the amount otherwise determined  under that subdivision multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which  is the number of days in the period beginning on the first day of such  taxable year and ending on the last day of the period specified in  subparagraph (5) of this paragraph and the denominator of which is 365  (366 if February 29 is a day included in the numerator),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount determined under subdivision (i)(b) of this  subparagraph shall be computed by using the amount determined under  (b)(1)(i) of this subdivision (v), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If no valuation date occurs before the end of such period, the  trust assets shall be valued as of the last day of such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> See subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for a special rule  allowing termination of payment of the unitrust amount with the regular  payment next preceding the termination of the period specified therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimum unitrust amount--(i) General rule. The fixed percentage  described in subparagraph (1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this paragraph with respect to all  beneficiaries taken together is not less than 5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduction of unitrust amount in certain cases. A trust will not  fail to meet the requirements of this subparagraph by reason of the fact  that it provides for a reduction of the fixed percentage payable upon  the death of a recipient or the expiration of a term of years Provided  That:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A distribution is made to an organization described in section  170(c) at the death of such recipient or the expiration of such term of  years, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The total of the percentage payable under subparagraph (1) of  this paragraph after such distribution is not less than 5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Permissible recipients--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. The amount described  in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is payable to or for the use of a  named person or persons, at least one of which is not an organization  described in section 170(c). If the amount described in subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph is to be paid to an individual or individuals, all  such individuals must be living at the time of creation of the trust. A  named person or persons may include members of a named class except in  the case of a class which includes any individual, all such individuals  must be alive and ascertainable at the time of the creation of the trust  unless the period for which the unitrust amount is to be paid to such  class consists solely of a term of years. For example, in the case of a  testamentary trust, the testator's will may provide that the required  amount shall be paid to his children living at his death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Power to alter amount paid to recipients. A trust is not a  charitable remainder unitrust if any person has the power to alter the  amount to be paid to any named person other than an organization  described in section 170(c) if such power would cause any person to be  treated as the owner of the trust, or any portion thereof, if subpart E,  part 1, subchapter J, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Code were applicable  to such trust. See paragraph (a)(4) of this section for a rule  permitting the retention by a grantor of a testamentary power to revoke  or terminate the interest of any recipient other than an organization  described in section 170(c). For example, the governing instrument may  not grant the trustee the power to allocate the fixed percentage among  members of a class unless such power falls within one of the exceptions  to section 674(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other payments. No amount other than the amount described in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be paid to or for the use of any  person other than an organization described in section 170(c). An amount  is not paid to or for the use of any person other than an organization  described in section 170(c) if the amount is transferred for full and  adequate consideration. The trust may not be subject to a power to  invade, alter, amend, or revoke for the beneficial use of a person other  than an organization described in section 170(c). Notwithstanding the  preceding sentence, the grantor may retain the power exercisable only by  will to revoke or terminate the interest of any recipient other than an  organization described in section 170(c). The governing instrument may  provide that any amount other than the amount described in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph shall be paid (or may be paid in the discretion of  the trustee) to an organization described in section 170(c) provided  that, in the case of distributions in kind, the adjusted basis of the  property distributed is fairly representative of the adjusted basis of  the property available for payment on the date of payment. For example,  the governing instrument may provide that a portion of the trust assets  may be distributed currently, or upon the death of one or more  recipients, to an organization described in section 170(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Period of payment of unitrust amount--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rules. The  period for which an amount described in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph is payable begins with the first year of the charitable  remainder trust and continues either for the life or lives of a named  individual or individuals or for a term of years not to exceed 20 years.  Only an individual or an organization described in section 170(c) may  receive an amount for the life of an individual. If an individual  receives an amount for life, it must be solely for his life. Payment of  the amount described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may terminate  with the regular payment next preceding the termination of the period  described in this subparagraph. The fact that the recipient may not  receive such last payment shall not be taken into account for purposes  of determining the present value of the remainder interest. In the case  of an amount payable for a term of years, the length of the term of  years shall be ascertainable with certainty at the time of the creation  of the trust, except that the term may be terminated by the death of the  recipient or by the grantor's exercise by will of a retained power to  revoke or terminate the interest of any recipient other than an  organization described in section 170(c). In any event, the period may  not extend beyond either the life or lives of a named individual or  individuals or a term of years not to exceed 20 years. For example, the  governing instrument may not provide for the payment of a unitrust  amount to A for his life and then to B for a term of years because it is  possible for the period to last longer than either the lives of  recipients in being at the creation of the trust or a term of years not  to exceed 20 years. On the other hand, the governing instrument may  provide for the payment of a unitrust amount to A for his life and then  to B for his life or a term of years (not to exceed 20 years), whichever  is shorter (but not longer), if both A and B are in being at the  creation of the trust because it is not possible for the period to last  longer than the lives of recipients in being at the creation of the  trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Relationship to 5 percent requirement. The 5 percent  requirement provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph must be met  until the termination of all of the payments described in subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph. For example, the following provisions would  satisfy the above rules:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A fixed percentage of at least 5 percent to A and B for their  joint lives and then to the survivor for his life;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A fixed percentage of at least 5 percent to A for life or for a  term of years not longer than 20 years, whichever is longer (or  shorter);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A fixed percentage of at least 5 percent to A for life or for a  term of years not longer than 20 years and then to B for life (provided  B was living at the creation of the trust);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A fixed percentage to A for his life and concurrently a fixed  percentage to B for his life (the percentage to each recipient to  terminate at his death) if the percentage given to each individual is  not less than 5 percent;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A fixed percentage to A for his life and concurrently an equal  percentage to B for his life, and at the death of the first to die, the  trust to distribute one-half of the then value of its assets to an  organization described in section 170(c) if the total of the percentages  is not less than 5 percent for the entire period described in this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Permissible remaindermen--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. At the end of the  period specified in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, the entire  corpus of the trust is required to be irrevocably transferred, in whole  or in part, to or for the use of one or more organizations described in  section 170(c) or retained, in whole or in part, for such use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of trust. If all of the trust corpus is to be  retained for such use, the taxable year of the trust shall terminate at  the end of the period specified in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph  and the trust shall cease to be treated as a charitable remainder trust  for all purposes. If all or any portion of the trust corpus is to be  transferred to or for the use of such organization or organizations, the  trustee shall have a reasonable time after the period specified in  subparagraph (5) of this paragraph to complete the settlement of the  trust. During such time, the trust shall continue to be treated as a  charitable remainder trust for all purposes, such as section 664,  4947(a)(2), and 4947(b)(3)(B). Upon the expiration of such period, the  taxable year of the trust shall terminate and the trust shall cease to  be treated as a charitable remainder trust for all purposes. If the  trust continues in existence, it will be subject to the provisions of  section 4947(a)(1) unless the trust is exempt from taxation under  section 501(a). For purposes of determining whether the trust is exempt  under section 501(a) as an organization described in section 501(c)(3),  the trust shall be deemed to have been created at the time it ceases to  be treated as a charitable remainder trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Concurrent or successive remaindermen. Where interests in the  corpus of the trust are given to more than one organization described in  section 170(c) such interests may be enjoyed by them either concurrently  or successively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Alternative remaindermen. The governing instrument shall  provide that if an organization to or for the use of which the trust  corpus is to be transferred or for the use of which the trust corpus is  to be retained is not an organization described in section 170(c) at the  time any amount is to be irrevocably transferred to or for the use of  such organization, such amount shall be transferred to or for the use of  or retained for the use of one or more alternative organizations which  are described in section 170(c) at such time. Such alternative  organization or organizations may be selected in any manner provided by  the terms of the governing instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additional contributions. A trust is not a charitable remainder  annuity trust unless its governing instrument either prohibits  additional contributions to the trust after the initial contribution or  provides that for the taxable year of the trust in which the additional  contribution is made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where no valuation date occurs after the time of the  contribution and during the taxable year in which the contribution is  made, the additional property shall be valued as of the time of  contribution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(a) of this section  shall be computed by multiplying the fixed percentage by the sum of (i)  the net fair market value of the trust assets (excluding the value of  the additional property and any earned income from and any appreciation  on such property after its contribution), and (ii) that proportion of  the value of the additional property (that was excluded under  subdivision (i) of this paragraph), which the number of days in the  period which begins with the date of contribution and ends with the  earlier of the last day of such taxable year or the last day of the  period described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section bears to the number  of days in the period which begins with the first day of such taxable  year and ends with the earlier of the last day of such taxable year or  the last day of the period described in paragraph (a)(5) of this  section.   For purposes of this section, all property passing to a charitable  remainder unitrust by reason of death of the grantor shall be considered  one contribution. The application of the preceding rules may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On March 2, 1971, X makes an additional contribution of  property to a charitable remainder unitrust. The taxable year of the  trust is the calendar year and the regular valuation date is January 1  of each year. For purposes of computing the required payout with respect  to the additional contribution for the year of contribution, the  additional contribution is valued on March 2, 1971, the time of  contribution. The property had a value on that date of $5,000. Income  from such property in the amount of $250 was received on December 31,  1971. The required payout with respect to the additional contribution  for the year of contribution is $208 (5 percentx$5,000x305/365). The  income earned after the date of the contribution and after the regular  valuation date does not enter into the computation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On July 1, 1971, X makes an additional contribution of  $10,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust. The taxable year of the  trust is the calendar year and the regular valuation date is December 31  of each year. The fixed percentage is 5 percent. Between July 1, 1971,  and December 31, 1971, the additional property appreciates in value to  $12,500 and earns $500 of income. Because the regular valuation date for  the year of contribution occurs after the date of the additional  contribution, the additional contribution including income earned by it  is valued on the regular valuation date. Thus, the required payout with  respect to the additional contribution is $325.87 (5  percentx[$12,500+$500]x183/365).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of the fair market value of the remainder interest  of a charitable remainder unitrust. See Sec. 1.664-4 for rules relating  to the calculation of the fair market value of the remainder interest of  a charitable remainder unitrust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Deduction for transfers to a charitable remainder unitrust. For  rules relating to a deduction for transfers to a charitable remainder  unitrust, see section 170, 2055, 2106, or 2522 and the regulations  thereunder. The deduction allowed by section 170 for transfers to  charity is limited to the fair market value of the remainder interest of  a charitable remainder unitrusts regardless of whether an organization  described in section 170(c) also receives a portion of the amount  described in Sec. 1.664-3(a)(1). For a special rule relating to the  reduction of the amount of a charitable contribution deduction with  respect to a contribution of certain ordinary income property or capital  gain property, see section 170(e)(1) (A) or (B)(i) and the regulations  thereunder. For rules for postponing the time for deduction of a  charitable contribution of a future interest in tangible personal  property, see section 170(a)(3) and the regulations thereunder.
