                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> and (m) of the act if it is labeled as  follows:</p><p class="depth0">Caution. Contains a new animal drug for investigational use only in  laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in  humans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person distributing or causing the distribution of new  animal drugs for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory  research purposes under this exemption shall use due diligence to assure  that the consignee is regularly engaged in conducting such tests and  that the shipment of the new animal drug will actually be used for tests  in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new  animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain  adequate records showing the name and post office address of the expert  or expert organization to whom the new animal drug is shipped and the  date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for  a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request  of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times,  he shall make such records available for inspection and copying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The exemption allowed in this paragraph shall not apply to any  new animal drug intended for in vitro use in the regular course of  diagnosing or treating disease, including antibacterial sensitivity  discs impregnated with any new animal drug or drugs, which discs are  intended for use in determining susceptibility of microorganisms to the  new animal drug or drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> New animal drugs for clinical investigation in animals. A  shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or an animal feed  containing a new animal   drug intended for clinical investigational use in animals shall be  exempt from section 512(a) and (m) of the act if all the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The label shall bear the statements:</p><p class="depth0">Caution. Contains a new animal drug for use only in investigational  animals in clinical trials. Not for use in humans. Edible products of  investigational animals are not to be used for food unless authorization  has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture.</p><p class="depth0">In the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to  accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the caution statements  required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the statements may be  included on the carton label and other labeling on or within the package  from which the new animal drug is to be dispensed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The person or firm distributing or causing the distribution of  the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug shall  use due diligence to assure that the new animal drug or animal feed  containing a new animal drug will actually be used for tests in animals  and is not used in humans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new  animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug for introduction  into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the  name and post office address of the investigator to whom the new animal  drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug is shipped and the  date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for  a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request  of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times,  such records shall be made available for inspection and copying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prior to shipment of the new animal drug for clinical tests in  animals, the sponsor of the investigation shall submit in triplicate to  FDA a ``Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal  Drug'' including a signed statement containing the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The identity of the new animal drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All labeling and other pertinent information to be supplied to  the investigators. When such pertinent information includes nonclinical  laboratory studies, the information shall include, with respect to each  nonclinical study, either a statement that the study was conducted in  compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter,  or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations,  a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The name and address of each clinical investigator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The approximate number of animals to be treated (or if not  available, the amount of new animal drug to be shipped).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the new animal drug is given to food-producing animals, the  statement shall contain the following additional information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A commitment that the edible products from such animals shall  not be used for food without prior authorization in accordance with the  provisions prescribed in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Approximate dates of the beginning and end of the experiment or  series of experiments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The maximum daily dose(s) to be administered to a given species,  the size of animal, maximum duration of administration, method(s) of  administration, and proposed withdrawal time, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct of  any clinical study to a contract research organization, a statement  containing the name and address of the contract research organization,  identification of the clinical study, and a listing of the obligations  transferred. If all obligations governing the conduct of the study have  been transferred, a general statement of this transfer--in lieu of a  listing of the specific obligations transferred--may be submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Authorization for use of edible products derived from a treated  food-producing animal may be granted under the provisions of this  section and when the following specified conditions are met, except that  in the case of an animal administered any unlicensed   experimental veterinary biological product regulated under the viruses,  serums, toxins statute (21 U.S.C., chapter V, sec. 151 et seq. ) the  product shall be exempt from the requirements of this section when U.S.  Department of Agriculture approval has been obtained as provided in 9  CFR 103.2. Conditional authorization may be granted in advance of  identification of the name(s) and address(es) of the clinical  investigator(s) as required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.  Information required for authorization shall include, in addition to all  other requirements of this section, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data to show that consumption of food derived from animals  treated at the maximum levels with the minimum withdrawal periods, if  any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(c) of this  section, will not be inconsistent with the public health; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Data to show that food derived from animals treated at the  maximum levels and with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any,  specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(c) of this section,  does not contain drug residues or metabolites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The name and location of the packing plant where the animals  will be processed, except that this requirement may be waived, on  request, by the terms of the authorization.  Authorizations granted under this paragraph do not exempt  investigational animals and their products from compliance with other  applicable inspection requirements. Any person who contests a refusal to  grant such authorization shall have an opportunity for a regulatory  hearing before FDA pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> On written request of FDA, the sponsor shall submit any  additional information reported to or otherwise received by him with  respect to the investigation deemed necessary to facilitate a  determination whether there are grounds in the interest of public health  for terminating the exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The sponsor shall assure himself that the new animal drug is  shipped only to investigators who:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are qualified by scientific training and/experience to evaluate  the safety and/or effectiveness of the new animal drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shall maintain complete records of the investigations,  including complete records of the receipt and disposition of each  shipment or delivery of the new animal drug under investigation. Copies  of all records of the investigation shall be retained by the  investigator for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or  approval of a new animal drug application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Shall furnish adequate and timely reports of the investigation  to the sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The sponsor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shall retain all reports received from investigators for 2 years  after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal  drug application and make such reports available to a duly authorized  employee of the Department for inspection at all reasonable times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Shall provide for current monitoring of the investigation by a  person qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate  information obtained from the investigation, and shall promptly  investigate and report to FDA and to all investigators any findings  associated with use of the new animal drug that may suggest significant  hazards pertinent to the safety of the new animal drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Shall not unduly prolong distribution of the new animal drug  for investigational use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Shall not, nor shall any person acting for or on behalf of the  sponsor, represent that the new animal drug is safe or effective for the  purposes for which it is under investigation. This requirement is not  intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Shall not commercially distribute nor test-market the new animal  drug until a new animal drug application is approved pursuant to section  512(c) of the act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If the shipment or other delivery of the new animal drug is  imported or offered for importation into the United States for clinical  investigational use in animals, it shall also meet the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The importer of all such shipments or deliveries is an agent of  the foreign exporter residing in the United States or the ultimate  consignee,   which person has, prior to such shipments and deliveries, informed FDA  of his intention to import the new animal drug as sponsor in compliance  with the conditions prescribed in this subdivision; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The new animal drug is shipped directly to a scientific  institution with adequate facilities and qualified personnel to conduct  laboratory or clinical investigations and is intended solely for use in  such institutions and which institution has submitted a statement as  sponsor of the investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The sponsor shall submit either a claim for categorical  exclusion under Sec. 25.30 or Sec. 25.33 of this chapter or an  environmental assessment under Sec. 25.40 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disqualification of a clinical investigator. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If FDA has  information indicating that an investigator (including a sponsor- investigator) has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the  conditions of these exempting regulations or has repeatedly or  deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any  required report, the Center for Veterinary Medicine will furnish the  investigator written notice of the matter complained of and offer the  investigator an opportunity to explain the matter in writing, or, at the  option of the investigator, in an informal conference. If an explanation  is offered and accepted by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the  Center will discontinue the disqualification proceeding. If an  explanation is offered but not accepted by the Center for Veterinary  Medicine, the investigator will be given an opportunity for a regulatory  hearing under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the  investigator is eligible to receive test articles under this part and  eligible to conduct any clinical investigation that supports an  application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by  FDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After evaluating all available information, including any  explanation presented by the investigator, if the Commissioner  determines that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed  to comply with the conditions of the exempting regulations in this  subchapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the  sponsor false information in any required report, the Commissioner will  notify the investigator and the sponsor of any investigation in which  the investigator has been named as a participant that the investigator  is not eligible to receive test articles under this part. The  notification to the investigator and sponsor will provide a statement of  the basis for such determination. The notification also will explain  that an investigator determined to be ineligible to receive test  articles under this part will be ineligible to conduct any clinical  investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing  permit for products regulated by FDA, including drugs, biologics,  devices, new animal drugs, foods, including dietary supplements, that  bear a nutrient content claim or a health claim, infant formulas, food  and color additives, and tobacco products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each application or submission to FDA under the provisions of  this chapter containing data reported by an investigator who has been  determined to be ineligible to receive FDA-regulated test articles is  subject to examination to determine whether the investigator has  submitted unreliable data that are essential to the continuation of an  investigation or essential to the approval of a marketing application,  or essential to the continued marketing of an FDA-regulated product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data  submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that  the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is  reasonably safe to continue the investigation, the Commissioner will  notify the sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory  hearing under part 16 of this chapter. If a danger to the public health  exists, however, the Commissioner shall terminate the exemption  immediately and notify the sponsor of the termination. In such case, the  sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA  under part 16 on the question of whether the exemption should be  reinstated. The determination that an investigation may not be  considered in support of a research or marketing   application or a notification or petition submission does not, however,  relieve the sponsor of any obligation under any other applicable  regulation to submit to FDA the results of the investigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data  submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that  the continued approval of the product for which the data were submitted  cannot be justified, the Commissioner will proceed to withdraw approval  of the product in accordance with the applicable provisions of the  relevant statutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An investigator who has been determined to be ineligible under  paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be reinstated as eligible when the  Commissioner determines that the investigator has presented adequate  assurances that the investigator will employ all test articles, and will  conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a  research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA, solely in  compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Termination of exemption. If the Commissioner finds that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor of the investigation has failed to comply with any  of the conditions for the exemption established under this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The continuance of the investigation is unsafe or otherwise  contrary to the public interest or the drug is being or has been used  for purposes other than bona fide scientific investigation, he shall  first notify the sponsor and invite his immediate correction. If the  conditions of the exemption are not immediately met, the sponsor shall  have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA pursuant of part  16 of this chapter on whether the exemption should be terminated. If the  exemption is terminated the sponsor shall recall or have destroyed the  unused supplies of the new animal drug.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Statements and requests. ``Notice(s) of Claimed Investigational  Exemption for a New Animal Drug'' and requests for authorization to use  investigational animals and their products for food should be addressed  to the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug  Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl.,  Rockville, MD 20855.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Contract research organizations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this part  and part 514, contract research organization means a person that  assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of  the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or  monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of  materials to be submitted to FDA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A sponsor may transfer responsibility for any or all of the  obligations set forth in this part to a contract research organization.  Any such transfer shall be in writing and, if not all obligations are  transferred, shall describe each of the obligations being assumed by the  contract research organization. If all obligations are transferred, a  general statement that all obligations have been transferred is  acceptable. Any obligation not covered by the written description shall  be deemed not to have been transferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A contract research organization that assumes any obligation of  a sponsor shall comply with the specific regulations in this chapter  applicable to this obligation and shall be subject to the same  regulatory action as a sponsor for failure to comply with any obligation  assumed under these regulations. Thus, all references to sponsor in this  part apply to a contract research organization to the extent that it  assumes one or more obligations of the sponsor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor  species. All provisions of part 511 apply to new animal drugs for  investigational use in support of indexing, as described in section 572  of the act, subject to the provisions of Sec. 516.125 of this chapter.
