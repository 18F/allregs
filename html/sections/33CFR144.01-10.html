This painter  shall be a manila rope not less than 2\3/4\ inches in circumference and  of a length not less than three times the distance from the deck where  the lifefloat is stowed to the low water line.

The water light must be attached to the life float by a 12- thread manila or equivalent synthetic lanyard not less than 2 meters (6  feet) nor more than 4 meters (12 feet) in length. The water light must  be mounted on a bracket so that when the life float is launched, the  water light will pull free of the bracket.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Two paddles shall be provided for each life float. The paddles  shall not be less than five feet nor more than six feet long. The  paddles shall be stowed in such a way that they will be readily  accessible from either side of the life float when in the water.
