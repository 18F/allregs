However, regardless of the amount involved (including requisitions estimated to be less than the dollar limitations referenced above), purchase action shall not be taken by GSA or an agency unless a waiver of the requirement for using items of tape available from Federal Supply Schedule contracts has been furnished in accordance with Sec. 101-26.100-2.
Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service (F), General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20406. The requests shall fully describe the type of tape required and state the reasons Federal Supply Schedule items will not adequately serve the agency's needs. GSA will notify the requesting agency in writing of the action taken on the requests. To reduce leadtime, requisitions may be submitted in FEDSTRIP format with the requests for waivers. Requisitions for which a waiver has first been obtained shall be submitted with a copy of the waiver to the GSA regional office supporting the geographic area in which the requisitioner is located. GSA will either arrange for procurement of the items or authorize the requesting agency to procure them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When establishing required delivery dates in purchase requests submitted in accordance with this Sec. 101-26.508-2, agencies should normally allow 105 days leadtime to permit orderly procurement by GSA. In addition to this 105 days leadtime, inspection and testing of the tape requires approximately 15 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When an agency submitting a purchase request in accordance with this Sec. 101-26.508-2 has a need for scheduled deliveries, minimum or maximum order quantities, or other special arrangements, GSA will develop specific provisions to accommodate the needs.

The provisions will be based on information furnished by the agency concerned and will be included in solicitations for offers and resultant contracts.
