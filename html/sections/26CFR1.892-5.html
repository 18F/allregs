                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of section 892(a)(2)(B), the term entity means and  includes a corporation, a partnership, a trust (including a pension  trust described in Sec. 1.892-2T(c)) and an estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. This section applies on or after January 14,  2002. See Sec. 1.892-5T(a) for the rules that apply before January 14,  2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> through (d).  [T.D. 9012, 67 FR 49864, Aug. 1, 2002]    Sec. 1.892-5T  Controlled commercial entity (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The exemption generally applicable to a foreign  government (as defined in Sec. 1.892-2T) for income described in Sec.  1.892-3T does not apply to income received by a controlled commercial  entity or received (directly or indirectly) from a controlled commercial  entity. The term ``controlled commercial entity'' means any entity  engaged in commercial activities as defined in Sec. 1.892-4T (whether  conducted within or outside the United States) if the government--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Holds (directly or indirectly) any interest in such entity which  (by value or voting power) is 50 percent or more of the total of such  interests in such entity, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Holds (directly or indirectly) a sufficient interest (by value  or voting power) or any other interest in such entity which provides the  foreign government with effective practical control of such entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Entities treated as engaged in commercial activity--(1) U.S.  real property holding corporations. A United States real property  holding corporation, as defined in section 897(c)(2) or a foreign  corporation that would be a United States real property holding  corporation if it was a United States corporation, shall be treated as  engaged in commercial activity and, therefore, is a controlled  commercial entity if the requirements of paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (a)(2) of  this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Central banks. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a  central bank of issue (as defined in Sec. 1.895-1(b)) shall be treated  as a controlled commercial entity only if it engages in commercial  activities within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pension trusts. A pension trust, described in Sec. 1.892-2T(c),  which engages in commercial activities within or outside the United  States, shall be treated as a controlled commercial entity. Income  derived by such a pension trust is not income of a foreign government  for purposes of the exemption from taxation provided in section 892. A  pension trust described in Sec. 1.892-2T(c) shall not be treated as a  controlled commercial entity if such trust solely earns income which  would not be unrelated business taxable income (as defined in section  512(a)(1)) if the trust were a qualified trust described in section  401(a). However, only income derived by a pension trust that is  described in Sec. 1.892-3T and which is not from commercial activities  as defined in Sec. 1.892-4T is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Control--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Attribution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. In determining for purposes  of paragraph (a) of this section the interest held by a foreign  government, any interest in an entity (whether or not engaged in  commercial activity) owned directly or indirectly by an integral part or  controlled entity of a foreign sovereign shall be treated as actually  owned by such foreign sovereign.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustration. The following example illustrates the application  of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. FX, a controlled entity of foreign sovereign FC, owns 20  percent of the stock of Corp 1. Neither FX nor Corp 1 is engaged in  commercial activity anywhere in the world. Corp 1 owns 60 percent of the  stock of Corp 2, which is engaged in commercial activity. The remaining  40 percent of Corp 2's stock is owned by Bureau, an integral part of  foreign sovereign FC. For purposes of determining whether Corp 2 is a  controlled commercial entity of FC, Bureau will be treated as actually  owning the 12 percent of Corp 2's stock   indirectly owned by FX. Therefore, since Bureau directly and indirectly  owns 52 percent of the stock of Corp 2, Corp 2 is a controlled  commercial entity of FC within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this  section. Accordingly, dividends or other income received, directly or  indirectly, from Corp 2 by either Bureau or FX will not be exempt from  taxation under section 892. Furthermore, dividends from Corp 1 to the  extent attributable to dividends from Corp 2 will not be exempt from  taxation. Thus, a distribution from Corp 1 to FX shall be exempt only to  the extent such distribution exceeds Corp 1's earnings and profits  attributable to the Corp 2 dividend amount received by Corp 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective practical control. An entity engaged in commercial  activity may be treated as a controlled commercial entity if a foreign  government holds sufficient interests in such entity to give it  ``effective practical control'' over the entity. Effective practical  control may be achieved through a minority interest which is  sufficiently large to achieve effective control, or through creditor,  contractual, or regulatory relationships which, together with ownership  interests held by the foreign government, achieve effective control. For  example, an entity engaged in commercial activity may be treated as a  controlled commercial entity if a foreign government, in addition to  holding a small minority interest (by value or voting power), is also a  substantial creditor of the entity or controls a strategic natural  resource which such entity uses in the conduct of its trade or business,  giving the foreign government effective practical control over the  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Related controlled entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Brother/sister entities.  Commercial activities of a controlled entity are not attributed to such  entity's other brother/sister related entities. Thus, investment income  described in Sec. 1.892-2T that is derived by a controlled entity that  is not itself engaged in commercial activity within or outside the  United States is exempt from taxation notwithstanding the fact that such  entity's brother/sister related entity is a controlled commercial  entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parent/subsidiary entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Subsidiary to parent  attribution. Commercial activities of a subsidiary controlled entity are  not attributed to its parent. Thus, investment income described in Sec.  1.892-3T that is derived by a parent controlled entity that is not  itself engaged in commercial activity within or outside the United  States is exempt from taxation notwithstanding the fact that its  subsidiary is a controlled commercial entity. Dividends or other  payments of income received by the parent controlled entity from the  subsidiary are not exempt under section 892, because it constitutes  income received from a controlled commercial entity. Furthermore,  dividends paid by the parent are not exempt to the extent attributable  to the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiary. Thus, a  distribution by the parent shall be exempt only to the extent such  distribution exceeds earnings and profits attributable to the dividend  received from its subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Parent to subsidiary attribution. Commercial activities of a  parent controlled entity are attributed to its subsidiary. Thus,  investment income described in Sec. 1.892-3T that is derived by a  subsidiary controlled entity (not engaged in commercial activity within  or outside the United States) is not exempt from taxation under section  892 if its parent is a controlled commercial entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partnerships. Except for partners of publicly traded  partnerships, commercial activities of a partnership are attributable to  its general and limited partners for purposes of section 892. For  example, where a controlled entity is a general partner in a partnership  engaged in commercial activities, the controlled entity's distributive  share of partnership income (including income described in Sec. 1.892- 3T) will not be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Illustrations. The principles of this section may be illustrated  by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of this section. Therefore, income  described in Sec. 1.892-3T is ineligible for exemption under section  892   only to the extent derived from the conduct of commercial activities.  Accordingly, the Ministry's income from the stocks and bonds is exempt  from U.S. tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (1)(a), except that the  Ministry also owns 75 percent of the stock of R, a U.S. holding company  that owns all the stock of S, a U.S. operating company engaged in  commercial activity. Ministry's dividend income from R is income  received indirectly from a controlled commercial entity. The Ministry's  income from the stocks and bonds, with the exception of dividend income  from R, is exempt from U.S. tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (1)(a), except that the  Ministry is a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign. Since the  Ministry is a controlled entity and is engaged in commercial activity,  it is a controlled commercial entity within the meaning of paragraph (a)  of this section, and none of its income is eligible for exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Z, a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign, has  established a pension trust as part of a pension plan for the benefit of  its employees and former employees. The pension trust (T), which meets  the requirements of Sec. 1.892-2T(c), has investments in the U.S. in  various stocks, bonds, annuity contracts, and a shopping center which is  leased and managed by an independent real estate management firm. T also  makes securities loans in transactions that qualify under section 1058.  T's investment in the shopping center is not considered an unrelated  trade or business within the meaning of section 513(b). Accordingly, T  will not be treated as engaged in commercial activity. Since T is not a  controlled commercial entity, its investment income described in Sec.  1.892-3T, with the exception of income received from the operations of  the shopping center, is exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> giving rise to unrelated business taxable income. Since the  commercial activities of a partnership are attributable to its partners,  T will be treated as engaged in commercial activity and thus will be  considered a controlled commercial entity. Accordingly, none of T's  income will be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The facts are the same as Example (2)(a), except that Z is a  controlled commercial entity. The result is the same as in Example  (2)(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Interior, an integral part of  foreign sovereign FC, wholly owns corporations G and H. G, in turn,  wholly owns S. G, H and S are each controlled entities. G, which is not  engaged in commercial activity anywhere in the world, receives interest  income from deposits in banks in the United States. Both H and S do not  have any investments in the U.S. but are both engaged in commercial  activities. However, only S is engaged in commercial activities within  the United States. Because neither the commercial activities of H nor  the commercial activities of S are attributable to the Department of  Interior or G, G's interest income is exempt from taxation under section  892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as Example (3)(a), except that G rather  than S is engaged in commercial activities and S rather than G receives  the interest income from the United States. Since the commercial  activities of G are attributable to S, S's interest income is not exempt  from taxation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> K, a controlled entity of a foreign sovereign, is a  general partner in the Daj partnership. The Daj partnership has  investments in the U.S. in various stocks and bonds and also owns and  manages an office building in New York. K will be deemed to be engaged  in commercial activity by being a general partner in Daj even if K does  not actually make management decisions with regard to the partnership's  commercial activity, the operation of the office building. Accordingly  K's distributive share of partnership income (including income derived  from stocks and bonds) will not be exempt from taxation under section  892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (4)(a), except that the Daj  partnership has hired a real estate management firm to lease offices and  manage the building. Notwithstanding the fact that an independent  contractor is performing the activities, the partnership shall still be  deemed to be engaged in commercial activity. Accordingly, K's  distributive share of partnership income (including income derived from  stocks and bonds) will not be exempt from taxation under section 892.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The facts are the same as in Example (4)(a), except that K is a  partner whose partnership interest is considered a publicly traded  partnership interest within the meaning of section 7704. Under paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, the partnership's commercial activity will not  be attributed to K. Since K will not be deemed to be engaged in  commercial activity, K's distributive share of partnership income  derived from stocks and bonds will be exempt from taxation under section  892.  [T.D. 8211, 53 FR 24064, June 27, 1988, as amended by T.D. 9012, 67 FR  49864, Aug. 1, 2002]     Sec. 1.892-6T  Income of international organizations  (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(18))</em> received from investments in the United States in stocks,  bonds, or other domestic securities, owned by such international  organization, or from interest on deposits in banks in the United States  of moneys belonging to such international organization, or from any  other source within the United States, is exempt from Federal income  tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Income received prior to Presidential designation. An  organization designated by the President through appropriate Executive  order as entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities  provided in the International Organizations Immunities Act may enjoy the  benefits of the exemption with respect to income of the prescribed  character received by such organization prior to the date of the  issuance of such Executive order, if (i) the Executive order does not  provide otherwise and (ii) the organization is a public international  organization in which the United States participates, pursuant to a  treaty or under the authority of an act of Congress authorizing such  participation or making an appropriation for such participation, at the  time such income is received.  [T.D. 8211, 53 FR 24065, June 27, 1988]    Sec. 1.892-7T  Relationship to other Internal Revenue Code sections  (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 893. The term ``foreign government'' referred to in  section 893 (relating to the exemption for compensation of employees of  foreign governments) has the same meaning as given such term in Sec.  1.892-2T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b))</em> that fails to qualify for the exemption from tax  provided by this section (for example, it is not wholly owned by a  foreign sovereign) may nevertheless be exempt from tax on the items of  income described in section 895.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Section 883(b). Nothing in section 892 or these regulations  shall limit the exemption provided under section 883(b) relating  generally to the exemption of earnings derived by foreign participants  from the ownership or operation of communications satellite systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Section 884. Earnings and profits attributable to income of a  controlled entity of a foreign sovereign which is exempt from taxation  under section 892 shall not be subject to the tax imposed by section  884(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sections 1441 and 1442. No withholding is required under  sections 1441 and 1442 in the case of income exempt from taxation under  section 892.  [T.D. 8211, 53 FR 24066, June 27, 1988]</p>
