                                Sec. 205.9  Receipts at electronic terminals; periodic statements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receipts at electronic terminals--General. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a financial institution shall make a receipt available to a consumer at the time the consumer initiates an electronic fund transfer at an electronic terminal. The receipt shall set forth the following information, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amount. The amount of the transfer. A transaction fee may be included in this amount, provided the amount of the fee is disclosed on the receipt and displayed on or at the terminal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Date. The date the consumer initiates the transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Type. The type of transfer and the type of the consumer's account(s) to or from which funds are transferred. The type of account may be omitted if the

access device used is able to access only one account at that terminal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identification. A number or code that identifies the consumer's account or accounts, or the access device used to initiate the transfer. The number or code need not exceed four digits or letters to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Terminal location. The location of the terminal where the transfer is initiated, or an identification such as a code or terminal number. Except in limited circumstances where all terminals are located in the same city or state, if the location is disclosed, it shall include the city and state or foreign country and one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The street address; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A generally accepted name for the specific location; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name of the owner or operator of the terminal if other than the account-holding institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Third party transfer. The name of any third party to or from whom funds are transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Periodic statements. For an account to or from which electronic fund transfers can be made, a financial institution shall send a periodic statement for each monthly cycle in which an electronic fund transfer has occurred; and shall send a periodic statement at least quarterly if no transfer has occurred. The statement shall set forth the following information, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transaction information. For each electronic fund transfer occurring during the cycle:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of the transfer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the transfer was credited or debited to the consumer's account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type of transfer and type of account to or from which funds were transferred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For a transfer initiated by the consumer at an electronic terminal (except for a deposit of cash or a check, draft, or similar paper instrument), the terminal location described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The name of any third party to or from whom funds were transferred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Account number. The number of the account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fees. The amount of any fees assessed against the account during the statement period for electronic fund transfers, for the right to make transfers, or for account maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Account balances. The balance in the account at the beginning and at the close of the statement period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Address and telephone number for inquiries. The address and telephone number to be used for inquiries or notice of errors, preceded by ``Direct inquiries to'' or similar language. The address and telephone number provided on an error resolution notice under Sec. 205.8(b) given on or with the statement satisfies this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Telephone number for preauthorized transfers. A telephone number the consumer may call to ascertain whether preauthorized transfers to the consumer's account have occurred, if the financial institution uses the telephone-notice option under</p><p class="depth3">Sec. 205.10(a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to the periodic statement requirement for certain accounts--(1) Preauthorized transfers to accounts. For accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preauthorized transfers to accounts. For accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Passbook accounts. For passbook accounts, the financial institution need not provide a periodic statement if the institution updates the passbook upon presentation or enters on a separate document the amount and date of each electronic fund transfer since the passbook was last presented.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other accounts. For accounts other than passbook accounts, the financial institution must send a periodic statement at least quarterly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Intra-institutional transfers. For an electronic fund transfer initiated by the consumer between two accounts of the consumer in the same institution, documenting the transfer on a periodic statement for one of the two accounts satisfies the periodic statement requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Relationship between paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. An account that is accessed by preauthorized transfers to the account described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and by intra-institutional transfers described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, but by no other type of electronic fund transfers, qualifies for the exceptions

provided by paragraph (c)(1) of this section .</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Documentation for foreign-initiated transfers. The failure by a financial institution to provide a terminal receipt for an electronic fund transfer or to document the transfer on a periodic statement does not violate this part if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transfer is not initiated within a state; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The financial institution treats an inquiry for clarification or documentation as a notice of error in accordance with Sec. 205.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exception for receipts in small-value transfers. A financial institution is not subject to the requirement to make available a receipt under paragraph (a) of this section if the amount of the transfer is $15 or less.
