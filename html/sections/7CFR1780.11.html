                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All facilities financed under the provisions of this part shall be for public use. The facilities will be installed so as to serve any potential user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served. This does not preclude:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financing or constructing facilities where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to or parts thereof; the applicant publicly announces a plan for extending service to areas not initially receiving service from the system; and potential users located in the areas not to be initially served receive written notice from the applicant that service will not be provided until such time as it is economically feasible to do so.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Should the Agency determine that inequities exist within the applicants service area for the same type service proposed (i.e., water or waste disposal) such inequities will be remedied by the applicant prior to loan or grant approval or included as part of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems that were developed under different financing, rates, terms or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Developers are normally expected to provide utility-type facilities in new or developing areas in compliance with appropriate State statutes. RUS financing will be considered to an eligible applicant only in such cases when failure to complete development would result in an adverse economic condition for the rural area (not the community being developed); the proposal is necessary to the success of a current area development plan; and loan repayment can be assured by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant already having sufficient assured revenues to repay the loan; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Developers providing a bond or escrowed security deposit as a guarantee sufficient to meet expenses attributable to the area in question until a sufficient number of the building sites are occupied and connected to the facility to provide enough revenues to meet operating, maintenance, debt service, and reserve requirements.

Such guarantees from developers will meet the requirements in Sec. 1780.39(c)(4)(ii); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Developers paying cash for the increased capital cost and any increased operating expenses until the developing area will support the increased costs; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The full faith and credit of a public body where the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The loan is to a public body evidenced by a pledge of tax revenue or assessments; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The user charges can become a lien upon the property being served and income from such lien can be collected in sufficient time to be used for its intended purposes.
