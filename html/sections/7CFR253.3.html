                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions for distribution. In jurisdictions where the Food Stamp Program is in operation, there shall be no distribution of commodities to households under the authority of any law, except that distribution may be made (1) on a temporary basis under programs authorized by law to meet disaster relief needs, (2) for the purpose of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and (3) whenever a request for concurrent or separate Food Distribution Program on a reservation is made by an ITO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Concurrent or separate food program operation. Distribution of commodities, with or without the Food Stamp Program, shall be made whenever an ITO submits to FNS a completed application for the Food Distribution Program on all or part of a reservation and the application is approved by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when the Food Distribution Program is operating on all or part of a reservation, all eligible households within those boundaries may participate in the Food Distribution Program, or, if the ITO has elected concurrent operation of the Food Stamp Program, may elect to participate in either program, without regard to whether the household is an Indian tribal household.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FNS may determine, based on the number of non-Indian tribal households located on all or part of a reservation, that concurrent operation is necessary. When such a determination has been made all households residing in such areas may apply to participate in either the Food Stamp or the Food Distribution Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Household distribution. Commodities acquired under section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended; section 32 of Pub. L. 320, 74th Congress, as amended; section 709 of the Food and Agricultural Act of 1963, as amended; and section 4(a) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973, as amended, by section 1304 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, may be made available under part 250 of this chapter for distribution to households in accordance with the provisions of that part and the additional provisions and requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Food distribution program benefits. Households eligible under this part shall receive a monthly food package based on the number of household members. The food package offered to each household shall consist of a quantity and variety of commodities made available by the Department to provide eligible households with an opportunity to obtain a more nutritious diet and shall represent an acceptable nutritional alternative to Food Stamp Program benefits. The food package offered to each household by the State agency shall contain a variety of foods from each of the food groups in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations Monthly Distribution Guide Rates by Household Size--Vegetables, Fruit, Bread-Cereal-Rice-Pasta, Meat-Poultry-Fish-Dry Beans-Eggs-Nuts, Milk-Yogurt-Cheese, and Fats-Oils-Sweets. FNS shall periodically notify State agencies of the kinds of commodities it proposes to make available based, insofar as practicable, on the preferences of eligible households as determined by the State agency. In the event one or more of the proposed commodities cannot be delivered, the Department shall arrange for delivery of a similar commodity within the same food group.
