                                Sec. 711.8  How to request authorization from BIS to make electronic
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides an optional method of submitting  declarations or reports. Specifically, this section applies to the  electronic submission of declarations and reports required under the  CWCR. If you choose to submit declarations and reports by electronic  means, all such electronic submissions must be made through the Web-Data  Entry System for Industry (Web-DESI), which can be accessed on the CWC  web site at www.cwc.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Authorization. If you or your company has a facility, plant  site, or trading company that has been assigned a U.S. Code Number (USC  Number), you may submit declarations and reports electronically, once  you have received authorization from BIS to do so. An authorization to  submit declarations and reports electronically may be limited or  withdrawn by BIS at any time. There are no prerequisites for obtaining  permission to submit electronically, nor are there any limitations with  regard to the types of declarations or reports that are eligible for  electronic submission. However, BIS may direct, for any reason, that any  electronic declaration or report be resubmitted in writing, either in  whole or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requesting approval to submit declarations and reports  electronically. To submit declarations and reports electronically, you  or your company must submit a written request to BIS at the address  identified in Sec. 711.6 of the CWCR. Both the envelope and letter must  be marked, ``ATTN: Electronic Declaration or Report Request.'' Your  request should be on company letterhead and must contain your name or  the company's name, your mailing address at the company, the name of the  facility, plant site or trading company and its U.S. Code Number, the  address of the facility, plant site or trading company (this address may  be different from the mailing address), the list of persons who are  authorized to view, edit, and/or submit declarations and reports on  behalf of your company, and the telephone number and name and title of  the owner, operator, or senior management official responsible for  certifying that each person listed in the request is authorized to view,  edit, and/or submit declarations and reports on behalf of you or your  company (i.e., the certifying official). Additional information required  for submitting electronic declarations and reports may be found on BIS's  Web site at www.cwc.gov. Once you have completed and submitted the  necessary certifications, BIS will review your request for authorization  to view, edit, and/or submit declarations and reports electronically.  BIS will notify you if additional information is required and/or upon  completion of its review.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 711.8(b)(1): You must submit a separate request for  each facility, plant site or trading company owned by your company  (e.g., each site that is assigned a unique U.S. Code Number).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assignment and use of passwords for facilities, plant sites and  trading companies (USC password) and Web-DESI user accounts (user name  and password). (i) Each person, facility, plant site or trading company  authorized to submit declarations and reports electronically will be  assigned a password (USC password) that must be used in conjunction with  the U.S.C. Number. Each person authorized by BIS to view, edit, and/or  submit declarations and reports electronically for a facility, plant  site or trading company will be assigned a Web-DESI user account (user  name and password) telephonically by BIS. A Web-DESI user account will  be assigned to you only if your company has certified to BIS that you  are authorized to act for it in viewing, editing, and/or submitting  electronic declarations and reports under the CWCR.</p><p class="depth0">Note to Sec. 711.8(b)(2)(i): When persons must have access to  multiple Web-DESI accounts, their companies must identify such persons  on the approval request for each of these Web-DESI accounts. BIS will  coordinate with such persons to ensure that the assigned user name and  password is the same for each account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your company may reveal the facility, plant site or trading  company password (USC password) only to Web-DESI users with valid  passwords, their supervisors, and employees or agents of the company  with a commercial justification for knowing the password.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If you are an authorized Web-DESI account user, you may not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Disclose your user name or password to anyone;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Record your user name or password, either in writing or  electronically;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Authorize another person to use your user name or password; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Use your user name or password following termination, either by  BIS or by your company, of your authorization or approval for Web-DESI  use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> To prevent misuse of the Web-DESI account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If Web-DESI user account information (i.e., user name and  password) is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the company and the  user must report the loss, theft or compromise of the user account  information, immediately, by calling BIS at (202) 482-1001. Within two  business days of making the report, the company and the user must submit  written confirmation to BIS at the address provided in Sec. 711.6 of  the CWCR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Your company is responsible for immediately notifying BIS  whenever a Web-DESI user leaves the employ of the company or otherwise  ceases to be authorized by the company to submit declarations and  reports electronically on its behalf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> No person may use, copy, appropriate or otherwise compromise a  Web-DESI account user name or password assigned to another person. No  person, except a person authorized access by the company, may use or  copy the facility, plant site or trading company password (USC  password), nor may any person steal or otherwise compromise this  password.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Electronic submission of declarations and reports--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General  instructions. Upon submission of the required certifications and  approval of the company's request to use electronic submission, BIS will  provide instructions on both the method for transmitting declarations  and reports electronically and the process for submitting required  supporting documents, if any. These instructions may be modified by BIS  from time to time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Declarations and reports. The electronic submission of a  declaration or report will constitute an official document as required  under parts 712 through 715 of the CWCR. Such submissions must provide  the same information as written declarations and reports and are subject  to the recordkeeping provisions of part 720 of the CWCR. The company and  Web-DESI user submitting the declaration or report will be deemed to  have made all representations and certifications as if the submission  were made in writing by the company and signed by the certifying  official. Electronic submission of a declaration or report will be  considered complete upon transmittal to BIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Updating. A company approved for electronic submission of  declarations or reports under Web-DESI must promptly notify BIS of any  change in its name, ownership or address. If your company wishes to have  a person added as a Web-DESI user, your company must inform BIS and  follow the instructions provided by BIS. Your company should conduct  periodic reviews to ensure that the company's designated certifying  official and Web-DESI users are persons whose current responsibilities  make it necessary and appropriate that they act for the company in  either capacity.
