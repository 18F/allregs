The weight of the water required to fill the container is determined by  the general method provided in Sec. 130.12(a) of this chapter. Cut-out  weight is determined by the following method: Keep the unopened canned  shrimp container at a temperature of not less than 68 nor more than 75  Fahrenheit for at least 12 hours immediately preceding the  determination. After opening, distribute the shrimp evenly over the  meshes of a circular sieve that has been previously weighed.   The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity  of the contents of the container is less than 1.36 kilograms (3 pounds),  and 30.5 centimeters (12 inches), if such quantity is 1.36 kilograms (3  pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that  complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth as a 2.38 mm  (No. 8) sieve in the ``Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes'' of  the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official  Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by  reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North  Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information  on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go  to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_/ ibr_locations.html. Without shifting the material on the sieve, incline  the sieve at an angle of approximately 17 to 20 to facilitate  drainage. Allow the shrimp to drain for 2 minutes, measured from the  moment the product is poured onto the sieve. Weigh the sieve and the  drained shrimp. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall  be considered to be the cut-out weight of the shrimp.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sampling and acceptance procedure: A container that falls below  the requirement for minimum fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this  section is considered a ``defective.'' Determine compliance with  paragraph (c)(1) of this section as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of  this section except that the sample unit shall be the entire contents of  the container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If canned wet pack shrimp in transparent or nontransparent  containers falls below the applicable standard of fill of container  prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the  general statement of substandard fill provided in Sec. 130.14(b) of this  chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.
