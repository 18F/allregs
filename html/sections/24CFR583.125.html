Operating costs are those associated with the  day-to-day operation of the supportive housing. They also include the  actual expenses that a recipient incurs for conducting on-going  assessments of the supportive services needed by residents and the  availability of such services; relocation assistance under Sec.   583.310, including payments and services; and insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recipient match requirement for operating costs. Assistance for  operating costs will be available for up to 75 percent of the total cost  in each year of the grant term.

At the end of each  operating year, the recipient must demonstrate that it has met its match  requirement of the costs for that year.
