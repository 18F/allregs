                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General equipment leak requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this  section apply to pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices,  sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves,  connectors, instrumentation systems, control devices, and closed-vent  systems required by this section that are intended to operate in organic  hazardous air pollutant service 300 hours or more during the calendar  year within a source subject to the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consistency with other regulations. After the compliance date  for a process, equipment subject to both this section and either of the  following will be required to comply only with the provisions of this  subpart:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 40 CFR part 61.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provisions in Sec.  63.1(a)(3) of subpart A of this part do  not alter the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not  subject to the provisions of this section. Utilities, and other  nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not  combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not  considered to be part of a process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The provisions of this section do not apply to bench-scale  processes, regardless of whether the processes are located at the same  plant site as a process subject to the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Equipment to which this section applies shall be identified such  that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that is not subject  to this section. Identification of the equipment does not require  physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment may be  identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by designation of  process boundaries by some form of weatherproof identification. If  changes are made to the affected source subject to the leak detection  requirements, equipment identification for each type of component shall  be updated, if needed, within 90 calendar days or by the next Periodic  Report following the end of the monitoring period for that component,  whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> When each leak is detected by visual, audible, or olfactory  means, or by monitoring as described in Sec.  63.180(b) or (c), the  following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with  the equipment identification number, shall be attached to the leaking  equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The identification on a valve in light liquid or gas/vapor  service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in  paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, and no leak has been detected  during the follow-up monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The identification on equipment, except on a valve in light  liquid or gas/vapor service, may be removed after it has been repaired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)(i)</em> of this section, all  terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of  required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual) refer to the  standard calendar periods unless specified otherwise in the section or  paragraph that imposes the requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the initial compliance date does not coincide with the  beginning of the standard calendar period, an owner or operator may  elect to utilize a period beginning on the compliance date, or may elect  to comply in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(11)(ii) or  (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time periods specified in this subpart for completion of  required tasks may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or  operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part.  For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period  shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not  necessary for each recurring period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> or (B)  of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard  calendar period within which the initial compliance date occurs if there  remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least  2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for  tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for  tasks that must be performed annually; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end  of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which  the initial compliance date occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires  completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an  owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during each  period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after  completion of the task during the previous period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an  owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is  detected, it is a violation of this section to fail to take action to  repair the leaks within the specified time. If action is taken to repair  the leaks within the specified time, failure of that action to  successfully repair the leak is not a violation of this section.  However, if the repairs are unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the  owner or operator shall take further action as required by applicable  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> References. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of a source subject to  this section shall comply with the provisions of subpart H of this part,  as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section.
