                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An executive agency must review the effectiveness of all sales  solutions, and compare them to the effectiveness (e.g., cost, level of  service, and value added services) of the eFAS SCs. Agencies should give  full consideration to sales solutions utilizing private sector entities,  including small businesses, that are more effective than the solutions  provided by any eFAS-approved SC. If the agency decides that there are  more effective sales solutions than those solutions offered by the eFAS  SCs, the agency must request a waiver from the milestones using the  procedures and forms provided by the eFAS Planning Office. Waivers will  be approved by the eFAS Planning Office upon presentation of a business  case showing that complying with an eFAS milestone is either  impracticable or inefficient. Waiver approval will be coordinated with  GSA's Office of Travel, Transportation, and Asset Management. Contact  the eFAS Planning Office at FASPlanningOffice@gsa.gov to obtain these  procedures and forms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An approved waiver for meeting one of the eFAS milestones does  not automatically waive all milestone requirements. For example, if an  agency receives a waiver to the migration milestone, the agency must  still (1) post asset information on the eFAS Web site and (2) provide  post-sales data   to the eFAS Planning Office in accordance with the content and format  requirements developed by the eFAS ESC, unless waivers to these  milestones are also requested and approved. Waivers to the eFAS  milestones will not be permanent. Upon expiration of the waiver to the  migration milestone, an agency must either migrate to an approved SC, or  serve as a fully functioning SC, as soon as practicable. See the  definition of a ``Sales Center'' at Sec. 102-38.35 for an overview of  how agency sales solutions become SCs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An agency which receives a waiver from the eFAS milestones must  comply with subparts A through G of this part as if it were an SC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An executive agency must comply with all eFAS milestones  approved by OMB including those regarding the completion of an agency- wide sales migration plan, the reporting of pre- and post-sales data,  and the migration to approved SCs unless a waiver has been submitted by  the agency and approved by the eFAS Planning Office. The eFAS milestones  are available for viewing at http://www.gsa.gov/govsalesmilestones.</p>
