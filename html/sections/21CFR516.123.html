                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Should FDA make an initial decision denying a request for  determination of eligibility for indexing, terminating an  investigational exemption, determining that a qualified expert panel  does not meet the selection criteria, denying a request for addition to  the index, or removing a new animal drug from the index, FDA will give  written notice that specifies the grounds for the initial decision and  provides an opportunity for an informal conference for review of the  decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The written notice will include information for scheduling the  informal conference and state that a written request for a conference  must be made within 60 days of the date FDA sends its notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Within 45 days of receiving a request for an informal  conference, FDA will schedule and hold the informal conference at a time  agreeable to both FDA and the person making the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Such an informal conference will be conducted by a presiding  officer who will be the Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine  or his or her designee, excluding the Director of the Office of Minor  Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development and other persons  significantly involved in the initial decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The person requesting an informal conference must provide a  written response to FDA's initial decision at least 2 weeks prior to the  date of the scheduled meeting. Generally, this written response would be  attached to the request for an informal conference. At the option of the  person requesting an informal conference, such written response to FDA's  initial decision may act in lieu of a face-to-face meeting. In this  case, the informal conference will consist of a review by the presiding  officer of the submitted written response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The purpose of an informal conference is to discuss scientific  and factual issues. It will involve a discussion of FDA's initial  decision and any written response to that decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Internal agency review of a decision must be based on the  information in the administrative file. If the person requesting an  informal conference presents new information not in the file, the matter  will be returned to the appropriate lower level in the agency for  reevaluation based on the new information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Informal conferences under this part are not subject to the  separation of functions rules in Sec. 10.55 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The rules of evidence do not apply to informal conferences. No  motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and  views will be made or considered, but any party to the conference may  comment upon or rebut all such data, information and views.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The presiding officer will prepare a written report regarding  the subject of the informal conference that states and describes the  basis for his or her findings. Whenever time permits, the parties to the  informal conference will have 30 days to review and comment on the  report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The administrative record of the informal conference will  consist of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice providing an opportunity for an informal conference  and the written response to the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All written information and views submitted to the presiding  officer at the conference or, at the discretion of the presiding  officer, thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The presiding officer's written report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All correspondence and memoranda of any and all meetings between   the participants and the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The administrative record of the informal conference is closed  to the submission of information at the close of the conference, unless  the presiding officer specifically permits additional time for further  submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The administrative record of the informal conference specified  herein constitutes the exclusive record for decision.</p>
