                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mandatory CI evaluation. Except as provided in Sec. 709.5 of this part with regard to waivers, a CI evaluation, which may include a CI-scope polygraph examination, is required for any covered person in any category under paragraph (b) of this section who will have or has access to classified information or materials protected under this paragraph. Such an evaluation is required for covered persons who are incumbent employees at least once every five years. DOE, in its sole discretion, may require a CI-scope polygraph examination:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the CI evaluation reveals foreign nexus issues;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a covered person who is an incumbent employee is to be assigned within DOE to activities involving another agency and a polygraph examination is required as a condition of access to the activities by the other agency; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a covered person who is an incumbent employee is proposed to be assigned or detailed to another agency and the receiving agency requests DOE to administer a polygraph examination as a condition of the assignment or detail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Paragraph (a) of this section applies to covered persons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In an intelligence or counterintelligence program office (or with programmatic reporting responsibility to an intelligence or counterintelligence program office) because of access to classified intelligence information, or sources, or methods;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With access to Sensitive Compartmented Information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With access to information that is protected within a non-intelligence Special Access Program (SAP) designated by the Secretary;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With regular and routine access to Top Secret Restricted Data;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With regular and routine access to Top Secret National Security Information; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Designated, with approval of the Secretary, on the basis of a risk assessment consistent with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, by a Program Manager for the following DOE offices and programs (and any successors to

those offices and programs): The Office of the Secretary; the Human Reliability Program; the National Nuclear Security Administration (including the Office of Emergency Operations); and the Office of Health, Safety and Security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Random CI evaluation. Except as provided in Sec. 709.5 of this part with regard to waivers, DOE may require a CI evaluation, including a CI-scope polygraph examination, of covered persons who are incumbent employees selected on a random basis from the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All covered persons identified in Sec. 709.3(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All employees in the Office of Independent Oversight (or any successor office) within the Office of Health, Safety and Security because of access to classified information regarding the inspection and assessment of safeguards and security functions, including cyber security, of the DOE;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All employees in other elements of the Office of Health, Safety and Security (or any successor office) because of their access to classified information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All employees in the NNSA Office of Emergency Operations (OEO or any successor office) including DOE field offices or contractors who support OEO because of their access to classified information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All employees with regular and routine access to classified information concerning: The design and function of nuclear weapons use control systems, features, and their components (currently designated as Sigma 15); vulnerability of nuclear weapons to deliberate unauthorized nuclear detonation (currently designated as Sigma 14); and improvised nuclear device concepts or designs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any system administrator with access to a system containing classified information, as identified by the DOE or NNSA Chief Information Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific incident polygraph examinations. In response to specific facts or circumstances with potential counterintelligence implications with a defined foreign nexus, the Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (or, in the case of a covered person in NNSA, the Administrator of NNSA, after consideration of the recommendation of the Director, Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence) may require a covered person with access to DOE classified information or materials to consent to and take an event-specific polygraph examination. Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary, on the recommendation of the appropriate Program Manager, if a covered person with access to DOE classified information or materials refuses to consent to or take a polygraph examination under this paragraph, then the Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (or, in the case of a covered person in NNSA, the Administrator of NNSA, after consideration of the recommendation of the Director, Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence) shall direct the denial of access (if any) to classified information and materials protected under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and shall refer the matter to the Office of Health, Safety and Security for a review of access authorization eligibility under 10 CFR part 710. In addition, in the circumstances described in this paragraph, any covered person with access to DOE classified information or material may request a polygraph examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Risk assessment. For the purpose of deciding whether to designate or remove employees for mandatory CI evaluations under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, Program Managers may consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Access on a non-regular and non-routine basis to Top Secret Restricted Data or Top Secret National Security Information or the nature and extent of access to other classified information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unescorted or unrestricted access to significant quantities or forms of special nuclear materials; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any other factors concerning the employee's responsibilities that are relevant to determining risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information or materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Based on the risk assessments conducted under paragraph (e) of this section and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, the Program

Manager shall provide recommendations as to positions to be designated or removed under paragraph (b)(6) of this section for approval by the Secretary. Recommendations shall include a summary of the basis for designation or removal of the positions and of the views of the Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence as to the recommendations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Not less than once every calendar year quarter, the responsible Program Manager must provide a list of all incumbent employees who are covered persons under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to the Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.</p>
