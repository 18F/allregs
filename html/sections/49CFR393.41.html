                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Hydraulic-braked vehicles manufactured on or after September 2,  1983. Each truck and bus (other than a school bus) with a GVWR of 4,536  kg (10,000 pounds) or less which is subject to this part and school  buses with a GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 pounds) shall be  equipped with a parking brake system as required by FMVSS No. 571.105  (S5.2) in effect at the time of manufacture. The parking brake shall be  capable of holding the vehicle or combination of vehicles stationary  under any condition of loading in which it is found on a public road  (free of ice and snow). Hydraulic-braked vehicles which were not   subject to the parking brake requirements of FMVSS No. 571.105 (S5.2)  must be equipped with a parking brake system that meets the requirements  of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Air-braked power units manufactured on or after March 1, 1975,  and air-braked trailers manufactured on or after January 1, 1975. Each  air-braked bus, truck and truck tractor manufactured on and after March  1, 1975, and each air-braked trailer except an agricultural commodity  trailer, converter dolly, heavy hauler trailer or pulpwood trailer,  shall be equipped with a parking brake system as required by FMVSS No.  121 (S5.6) in effect at the time of manufacture. The parking brake shall  be capable of holding the vehicle or combination of vehicles stationary  under any condition of loading in which it is found on a public road  (free of ice and snow). An agricultural commodity trailer, heavy hauler  or pulpwood trailer shall carry sufficient chocking blocks to prevent  movement when parked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vehicles not subject to FMVSS Nos. 105 and 121 on the date of  manufacture. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each singly driven motor vehicle not subject to parking  brake requirements of FMVSS Nos. 105 or 121 at the time of manufacturer,  and every combination of motor vehicles must be equipped with a parking  brake system adequate to hold the vehicle or combination on any grade on  which it is operated, under any condition of loading in which it is  found on a public road (free of ice and snow).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The parking brake system shall, at all times, be capable of  being applied by either the driver's muscular effort or by spring  action. If other energy is used to apply the parking brake, there must  be an accumulation of that energy isolated from any common source and  used exclusively for the operation of the parking brake.   Exception: This paragraph shall not be applicable to air-applied,  mechanically-held parking brake systems which meet the parking brake  requirements of FMVSS No. 121 (S5.6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The parking brake system shall be held in the applied position  by energy other than fluid pressure, air pressure, or electric energy.  The parking brake system shall not be capable of being released unless  adequate energy is available to immediately reapply the parking brake  with the required effectiveness.
