A Board-regulated institution may use models to measure the specific risk of covered positions as provided in paragraph (a) of section 205 of this subpart (therefore, excluding securitization positions that are not modeled under section 209 of this subpart). A Board-regulated institution must use models to measure the specific risk of correlation trading positions that are modeled under Sec. 217.209.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for specific risk modeling.

If the Board-regulated institution's VaR-based measure captures all material aspects of specific risk for one or more of its portfolios of debt, equity, or correlation trading positions, the Board-regulated institution has no specific risk add-on for those portfolios for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of Sec. 217.204.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specific risk not modeled.
