(1) The  Assistant Administrator may enter into a Cooperative Agreement with any  state that establishes and maintains an active and adequate program for  the conservation of resident species listed as endangered or threatened.  In order for a state program to be deemed an adequate and active  program, the Assistant Administrator must find, and annually reconfirm  that the criteria of either sections 6(c)(1) (A) through (E) or sections  6(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> (i) and (ii) of the Act have been satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following receipt of an application by a state for a Cooperative  Agreement with a copy of a proposed state program, and a determination  by the Assistant Administrator that the state program is adequate and  active, the Assistant Administrator shall enter into an Agreement with  the state.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Cooperative Agreement, as well as the Assistant  Administrator's finding upon which it is based, must be reconfirmed  annually to ensure that it reflects new laws, species lists, rules or  regulations, and programs and to demonstrate that it is still adequate  and active.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation and availability of funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant  Administrator shall allocate funds, appropriated for the purpose of  carrying out section 6 of the Act, to various states using the following  as the basis for the determination:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The international commitments of the United States to protect  endangered or threatened species;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The readiness of a state to proceed with a conservation program  consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The number of federally listed endangered and threatened  species within a state;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The potential for restoring endangered and threatened species  within a state; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The relative urgency to initiate a program to restore and  protect an endangered or threatened species in terms of survival of the  species.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funds allocated to a state are available for obligation during  the fiscal year for which they are allocated and until the close of the  succeeding fiscal year. Obligation of allocated funds occurs when an  award or contract is signed by the Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Financial assistance and payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A state must enter into a  Cooperative Agreement before financial assistance is approved by the  Assistant Administrator for endangered or threatened species projects.  Specifically, the Agreement must contain the actions that are to be  taken by the Assistant Administrator and/or by the state, the benefits  to listed species expected to be derived from these actions, and the  estimated cost of these actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent to such Agreement, the Assistant Administrator may  further agree with a state to provide financial assistance in the  development and implementation of acceptable projects for the  conservation of endangered and threatened species. Documents to provide  financial assistance will consist of an application for Federal  assistance and an award or a contract. The availability of Federal funds  shall be contingent upon the continued existence of the Cooperative  Agreement and compliance with all applicable Federal regulations for  grant administration and cost accounting principles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The payment of the Federal share of costs incurred when  conducting activities included under a contract or award shall not  exceed 75 percent of the program costs as stated in the agreement.  However, the Federal share may be increased to 90 percent when two or  more states having a common interest in one or more endangered or  threatened resident species, the conservation of which may be enhanced  by cooperation of such states, jointly enter into an agreement with the  Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The state share of program costs may be in the form of cash or  in-kind contributions, including real property, subject to applicable  Federal regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Payments of funds, including payment of such preliminary costs  and expenses as may be incurred in connection with projects, shall not  be made unless all necessary or required documents are first submitted  to and approved by the Assistant Administrator.
