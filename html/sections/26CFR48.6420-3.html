                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exempt sales. Credits or payments are allowable only for  gasoline that was sold by the producer or importer in a transaction that  was subject to tax under section 4081. No credit or payment shall be  allowed or made under Sec. 48.6420-1 with respect to gasoline which was  exempt from the tax imposed by section 4081. For example, a State or  local government may not file a claim with respect to any gasoline which  it purchased tax free from the producer, even though the State or local  government used the gasoline on a farm for farming purposes. Similarly,  payment may not be made with respect to gasoline purchased by a State  tax free for its exclusive use, as provided in section 4221, which is  used on a State prison farm for farming purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>.
