This part  applies to only the equipment, process vents, storage vessels, or  transfer operations to which the referencing subparts apply. This part  does not extend applicability to equipment, process vents, storage  vessels, or transfer operations that are not regulated by the  referencing subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A; 40 CFR part 61,  subpart A; and 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, that are listed in table 1 of  this subpart still apply to owners or operators of regulated sources  expressly referenced to this part. The owner or operator shall comply  with the provisions in table 1 of this subpart in the column  corresponding to the referencing subpart. All provisions of 40 CFR part  60, subpart A; 40 CFR part 61, subpart A; and 40 CFR part 63, subpart A,  not expressly referenced in table 1 of this subpart do not apply, and  the provisions of this part apply instead, except that provisions which  were required to be met prior to implementation of this part 65 still  apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The provisions of the referencing subparts that are listed in  table 2 of this subpart still apply to owners or operators of regulated  sources expressly referenced to this part. The owner or operator shall  comply with the provisions in table 2 of this subpart in the row  corresponding to the referencing subpart. All provisions of the  referencing subparts not expressly referenced in table 2 to this subpart  do not apply and the provisions of this part apply instead, except that  provisions which were required to be met prior to implementation of this  part 65 still apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Owners or operators shall implement this part as specified in an  implementation schedule or at initial startup. The implementation date  shall be established by mutual agreement with the Administrator or  delegated authority. The implementation schedule shall be included in  the source's title V permit. For non-title V sources, the implementation  schedule shall be proposed by the source in the Initial Notification for  Part 65 Applicability as specified in Sec. 65.5(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There shall be no gaps in compliance between compliance with the  referencing subpart and compliance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transitioning out of this part. Owners or operators who decide  to no longer comply with this part and to comply with the provisions in  the referencing subpart instead shall comply with the following, as  applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This transition shall be carried out on a date established in a  title V permit or if the source is not a title V source, by a date  established by agreement with the Administrator or delegated authority.  The transition date shall be proposed in a title V permit amendment, or  for non-title V sources, in a periodic report or separate notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There shall be no gaps in compliance between compliance with  this part and compliance with the referencing subpart provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Overlap with other subparts of this part. When provisions of  another subpart of this part conflict with the provisions of this  subpart, the provisions of the other subpart shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equipment assignment procedures. If specific items of equipment  (pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling  connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors,  instrumentation systems, surge control vessels, and bottoms receivers)  that are part of a process unit complying with this part are managed by  different administrative organizations (for example, different  companies, affiliates, departments, divisions, etc.), those items of  equipment may be aggregated with any process unit within the plant site.</p>
