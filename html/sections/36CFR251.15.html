Only so much of the  surface of the lands shall be occupied, used, or disturbed as is  necessary in bona fide prospecting for, drilling, mining (including the  milling or concentration of ores), and removal of the reserved minerals,  oil, gas, or other inorganic substances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> None of the lands in which minerals are reserved shall be so  used, occupied, or disturbed as to preclude their full use for  authorized programs of the Forest Service until the record owner of the  reserved rights, or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, shall  have applied for and received a permit authorizing such use, occupancy,  or disturbance of those specifically described parts of the lands as may  reasonably be necessary to exercise of the reserved rights.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Said permit shall be issued upon agreement as to conditions  necessary to protect the interest of the United States including such  conditions deemed necessary to provide for the safety of the public and  other users of the land, and upon initial payment of the annual fee,  which shall be at the rate of $2 per acre or fraction of acre included  in the permit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The permit shall also provide that the record owner of the  reserved   right or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, will repair or  replace any improvements damaged or destroyed by the mining operations  and restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably serviceable for  authorized programs of the Forest Service, and shall provide for a bond  in sufficient amount as determined necessary by the Forest Service to  guarantee such repair, replacement or restoration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit  shall be cause for revocation of all rights to use, occupy, or disturb  the surface of the lands covered by the permit, but in the event of  revocation, a new permit shall be issued upon application when the  causes for revocation of the preceding permit have been satisfactorily  remedied and the United States has been reimbursed for any damages it  has incurred from the noncompliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All structures, other improvements, and materials shall be  removed from the lands within one year after the date of revocation of  the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Timber and/or young growth cut or destroyed in connection with  exercise of the reserved right shall be paid for at rates determined by  the Forest Service to be fair and equitable for comparable timber and/or  young growth in the locality.
