                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Portable cables and cords used to conduct electrical energy to face equipment shall conform to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have each conductor of a current-carrying capacity consistent with the Insulated Power Cable Engineers Association (IPCEA) standards. (See Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix I.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have current-carrying conductors not smaller than No. 14 (AWG). Cords with sizes 14 to 10 (AWG) conductors

shall be constructed with heavy jackets, the diameters of which are given in Table 6 in Appendix I.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be accepted as flame resistant under this part or approved under subpart K of part 7 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Have short-circuit protection at the outby (circuit-connecting) end of ungrounded conductors. (See Table 8 in Appendix I.) The fuse rating or trip setting shall be included in the assembler's specifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ordinarily the length of a portable (trailing) cable shall not exceed 500 feet. Where the method of mining requires the length of a portable (trailing) cable to be more than 500 feet, such length of cable shall be permitted only under the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The lengths of portable (trailing) cables shall not exceed those specified in Table 9, Appendix I, titled ``Specifications for Portable Cables Longer Than 500 Feet.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Short-circuit protection shall be provided by a protective device with an instantaneous trip setting as near as practicable to the maximum starting-current-inrush value, but the setting shall not exceed the trip value specified in MSHA approval for the equipment for which the portable (trailing) cable furnishes electric power.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Have nominal outside dimensions consistent with IPCEA standards. (See Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7 in Appendix I.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Have conductors of No. 4 (AWG) minimum for direct-current mobile haulage units or No. 6 (AWG) minimum for alternating-current mobile haulage units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Have not more than five well-made temporary splices in a single length of portable cable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sectionalized portable cables will be acceptable provided the connectors used inby the last open crosscut in a gassy mine meet the requirements of Sec. 18.41.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A portable cable having conductors smaller than No. 6 (AWG), when used with a trolley tap and a rail clamp, shall have well insulated single conductors not smaller than No. 6 (AWG) spliced to the outby end of each conductor. All splices shall be made in a workmanlike manner to insure good electrical conductivity, insulation, and mechanical strength.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Suitable provisions shall be made to facilitate disconnection of portable cable quickly and conveniently for replacement.
