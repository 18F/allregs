However, if the NHTSA finds that an  application does not contain the information required by this part, it  so informs the applicant, pointing out the areas of insufficiency and  stating that the application will not receive further consideration  until the required information is submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No public hearing, argument, or other formal proceeding is held  directly on an application filed under this part before its disposition  under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any interested person may, upon written request, appear  informally before an appropriate official of the NHTSA to discuss an  application for exemption or the action taken in response to a petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Administrator determines that the application does not  contain adequate justification, he denies it and notifies the petitioner  in writing. He also publishes in the Federal Register a notice of the  denial and the reasons for it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Administrator determines that the application contains  adequate justification, he grants it, and notifies the petitioner in  writing. He also publishes in the Federal Register a notice of the grant  and the reasons for it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless a later effective date is specified in the notice of the  grant, a temporary exemption is effective upon publication of the notice  in the Federal Register and exempts vehicles manufactured on and after  the effective date.
