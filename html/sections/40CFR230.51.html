                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recreational and commercial fisheries consist of harvestable  fish, crustaceans, shellfish, and other aquatic organisms used by man.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Possible loss of values: The discharge of dredged or fill  materials can affect the suitability of recreational and commercial  fishing grounds as habitat for populations of consumable aquatic  organisms. Discharges can result in the chemical contamination of  recreational or commercial fisheries. They may also interfere with the  reproductive success of recreational and commercially important aquatic  species through disruption of migration and spawning areas. The  introduction of pollutants at critical times in their life cycle may  directly reduce populations of commercially important aquatic organisms  or indirectly reduce them by reducing organisms upon which they depend  for food. Any of these impacts can be of short duration or prolonged,  depending upon the physical and chemical impacts of the discharge and  the biological availability of contaminants to aquatic organisms.</p>
