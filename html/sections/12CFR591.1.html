                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. This part contains regulations issued under section 5  of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as amended, and under section 341  of the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97- 320, 96 Stat. 1469, 1505-1507.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of this permanent preemption of  state prohibitions on the exercise of due-on-sale clauses by all  lenders, whether federally- or state-chartered, is to reaffirm the  authority of Federal savings associations to enforce due-on-sale  clauses, and to confer on other lenders generally comparable authority  with respect to the exercise of such clauses. This part applies to all  real property loans, and all lenders making such loans, as those terms  are defined in Sec. 591.2 of this part.</p>
