Sec. 31.6011(a)-1  Returns under Federal Insurance Contributions Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirement--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section and in Sec. 31.6011(a)-5 every employer is required to make a return for the first calendar quarter in which the employer pays wages, other than wages for agricultural labor, subject to the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and is required to make a return for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not wages are paid therein) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with Sec. 31.6011(a)-6. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 31.6011(a)-8 and in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, Form 941, ``Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,'' is the form prescribed for making the return required by this paragraph (a)(1). Such return shall not include wages for agricultural labor required to be reported on any return prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The return shall include wages received by an employee in the form of tips only to the extent of the tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section and in Sec. 31.6011(a)-5 every employer is required to make a return for the first calendar quarter in which the employer pays wages, other than wages for agricultural labor, subject to the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and is required to make a return for each subsequent calendar quarter (whether or not wages are paid therein) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with Sec. 31.6011(a)-6. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 31.6011(a)-8 and in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, Form 941, ``Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,'' is the form prescribed for making the return required by this paragraph (a)(1). Such return shall not include wages for agricultural labor required to be reported on any return prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The return shall include wages received by an employee in the form of tips only to the extent of the tips reported by the employee to the employer in a written statement furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employers of agricultural workers. Every employer who pays wages for agricultural labor with respect to taxes imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act must make a return for the first calendar year in which the employer pays such wages and for each subsequent calendar year (whether or not wages are paid) until the employer has filed a final return in accordance with Sec. 31.6011(a)-6. Form 943, ``Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees,'' is the form prescribed for making the annual return required by this section, except that, if the employer's principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico, the return must be made on Form 943-PR, ``Planilla para la Declaraci[oacute]n ANUAL de la Contribuci[oacute]n Federal del Patrono de Empleados Agr[iacute]colas.'' However, Form 943 is the form prescribed for making such return in the case of every employer of agricultural workers who is required pursuant to Sec. 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Employers of domestic workers. Schedule H (Form 1040), ``Household Employment Taxes,'' is the form prescribed for use by every employer in making a return as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in respect of wages, as defined in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, paid by the employer in any calendar year for domestic service as defined in section 3510. Schedule H (Form 1040) is generally filed as an attachment to an income tax return; however, if the employer does not otherwise have an obligation to file an income tax return, Schedule H (Form 1040) may be filed as a separate return. If, however, the employer is required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to make a return on Form 941, ``Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return,'' or under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to make a return on Form 943, ``Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return For Agricultural Employees,'' or under paragraph (a)(5) of this section to make a return on Form 944, ``Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,'' the employer may choose instead to report wages with respect to domestic workers on such Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944. If such wages are included on Form 941, Form 943, or Form 944, the employer must also include Federal unemployment tax for the employee(s) on Form 940, ``Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return,'' under the provisions of Sec. 31.6011(a)-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5), Form 941-

PR, ``Planilla para la Declaracion Federal TRIMESTRAL del Patrono,'' is the form prescribed for use in making the return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of every employer whose principal place of business is in Puerto Rico, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for Puerto Rico. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(5), Form 941-SS, ``Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands),'' is the form prescribed for use in making the return required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of every employer whose principal place of business is in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or if the employer has employees who are subject to income tax withholding for these U.S. possessions. Form 941 (or Form 944, as described under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, if the IRS notified the employer that Form 944 must be filed in lieu of Form 941) is the form prescribed for making the return in the case of every employer who is required pursuant to Sec. 31.6011(a)-4 to make a return of income tax withheld from wages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Employers in the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944)--(i) In general. Employers notified of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) are required to file Form 944, ``Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return,'' instead of Form 941 (or Form 941-SS or Form 941-PR under paragraph (a)(4) of this section) to make a return as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Upon proper request by the employer, the IRS will notify employers in writing of their qualification for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944). The IRS will notify employers when they no longer qualify for the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944) and must file Forms 941 instead.

The IRS will notify employers that their filing requirements have changed to Form 944 or Forms 941. Employers must follow the procedures in Revenue Procedure 2009-51 or its successor to request to opt in or opt out of the Employers' Annual Federal Tax Program (Form 944).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> When to report wages. Wages with respect to which taxes are imposed by the Federal Insurance contributions Act shall be reported in the return of such taxes required under this section or Sec. 31.6011(a)-5 for the return period in which they are actually paid unless they were constructively paid in a prior return period, in which case such wages shall be reported only in the return for such prior period. However, if such wages are deemed to be paid in a later return period, they shall be reported only in the return for such later period. See Sec. 31.3121(a)-2 relating to the time when wages are paid or deemed to be paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments and refunds.

the employee shall make a return for the calendar year in respect of the employee tax not collected by the employer. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the return shall be made on Form 1040. The form to be used by residents of the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa is Form 1040SS. In the case of a resident of Puerto Rico who is not required to make a return of income under section 6012(a), the form to be used is Form 1040SS, except that Form 1040PR shall be used if it is furnished by the Internal Revenue Service to such resident for use in lieu of Form 1040SS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time and place for filing returns.

Each return required under the regulations in this part, together with any prescribed copies or supporting data, shall be filled in and disposed of in accordance with the forms, instructions, and regulations applicable thereto. The return shall be carefully prepared so as fully and accurately to set forth the data required to be furnished therein. Returns which have not been so prepared will not be accepted as meeting the requirements of the regulations in this part. The return may be made by an agent in the name of the person required to make the return if an acceptable power of attorney is filed with the internal revenue office with which such person is required to file his returns and if such return includes all taxes required to be reported by such person on such return for the period covered by the return. Only one return on any one prescribed form for a return period shall be filed by or for a taxpayer. Any supplemental return made on such form in accordance with Sec. 31.6205-1 shall constitute a part of the return which it supplements. Except as may be provided under procedures authorized by the Commissioner with respect ot taxes imposed by the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, consolidated returns of two or more employers are not permitted, as for example, returns of a parent and a subsidiary corporation.

Copies of the prescribed return forms will so far as possible be regularly furnished taxpayers by the Internal Revenue Service. A taxpayer will not be excused from making a return, however, by the fact that no return form has been furnished to him. Taxpayers not supplied with the proper

forms should make application therefor to an internal revenue office in ample time to have their returns prepared, verified, and filed on or before the due date with the internal revenue office with which they are required to file their returns. See Secs. 31.6071 (a)-1 and 31.6091-1, relating, respectively, to the time and place for filing returns. In the absence of a prescribed return form, a statement made by a taxpayer disclosing the aggregate amount of wages or compensation reportable on such form for the period in respect of which a return is required and the amount of taxes due may be accepted as a tentative return. If filed within the prescribed time, the statement so made will relieve the taxpayer from liability for the addition to tax imposed for the delinquent filing of the return, provided that without unnecessary delay such tentative return is supplemented by a return made on the proper form. For additions to the tax in case of failure to file a return within the prescribed time, see the provisions of Sec. 301.6651-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
In any case where the use of Form W-2 is required from the purpose of making a return or reporting information, such requirement may be satisfied by submitting the information required by such form on magnetic tape or by other media, provided that the prior consent of the Commissioner of Social Security (or other authorized officer or employee thereof has been obtained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Signing and verification.
