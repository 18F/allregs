If no activities occurred in these areas,  and if no other potential for exposure exists, a no dose received  estimate is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If partial film badge data are available, define group(s) of  personnel with common activities and relationships to radiation  environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Using standard statistical methods, verify from the distribution  of film badge readings whether the badged sample adequately represents  the intended group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculate the mean external gamma dose, with variance and  confidence limits, for each unbadged population. Assign a dose equal to  95% probability that actual exposure did not exceed the assigned dose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If badge data is not available for a statistical calculation,  conduct a dose reconstruction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For dose reconstruction, define radiation environment through  use of all available scientific data, e.g., measurements of radiation  intensity, decay, radioisotopic composition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Quantitatively relate activities shielding, position, and other  factors to radiation environment as a function of time. Integrate dose  throughout period of exposure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Where possible, calculate mean dose with confidence limits;  otherwise calculate best estimate dose or, if data are too sparse, upper  limit dose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Compare calculations with available film badge records to verify  the calculated doses. Whether or not film badge data is available,  calculate initial and internal doses where identified as a meaningful  contribution to the total dose.</p>
