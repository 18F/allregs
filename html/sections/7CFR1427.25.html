                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> CCC will determine the world market price for upland cotton as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the period when only one daily price quotation is  available for each growth quoted for Middling one and three-thirty- second inch (M 1\3/32\-inch) cotton, CFR (cost and freight) Far East,  the prevailing world market price for upland cotton will be based on the  average of the quotations for the preceding Friday through Thursday for  the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\-inch  cotton, CFR Far East.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the period when both a price quotation for cotton for  shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year  (current Far East shipment price) and a price quotation for cotton for  shipment no earlier than October/November of the current calendar year  (forward Far East shipment price) are available for growths quoted for M  1\3/32\-inch cotton, CFR Far East, the prevailing world market price for  upland cotton will be based on the average of the current Far East  shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5  lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\-inch cotton,  CFR Far East, except as may be determined by the Secretary as specified  in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The upland cotton prevailing world market price determined as  specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is referred to  as the ``Far East price'' (FE).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If quotes are not available for 1 or more days in the 5-day  period, the available quotes during the period will be used.
