                                Sec. 25.3  Requests for nomination of arbitrators: Filing, disputes,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for nominations should be filed only where there exists  a dispute or problem which cannot more appropriately be resolved through  regular agency procedures. Parties, therefore, are expected to eliminate  from their requests matters not necessary to the resolution of such  dispute or problem and to use their best efforts to secure agreement on  as many issues as possible before making the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for nominations may be filed either by an agency, or by  an employee organization as described in Sec. 25.1, or jointly by an  agency and one or more employee organizations. Joint requests are  encouraged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the  Secretary will entertain on its merits a request by an employee  organization for nomination of an arbitrator on a question of unit  determination which is made within 30 days after receipt of an agency's  final unit determination or 75 days after an appropriate request for  exclusive recognition and no final unit determination has been received  from the agency, provided the organization has   observed any reasonable time limits established by the agency for the  processing of such requests within the agency. The Secretary will  entertain on its merits a request by an employee organization for  nomination of an arbitrator on a question of majority representation  which is made within 15 days after an agency's decision with respect to  a determination of majority representation. Any request by an employee  organization for the nomination of an arbitrator will be considered  untimely if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written request for exclusive recognition was not made prior  to the grant of such recognition to another organization provided such  grant was preceded by posted notice to all employees in the unit and  written notice to all organizations known to represent such employees  that a request for exclusive recognition was under consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written request for exclusive recognition was not made within  5 days after the agency posted appropriate notice of its intention to  conduct an election to determine majority status, or more than 10 days  before the date of the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It was made less than 12 months after an agency's final unit  determination with respect to such unit or subdivision thereof in a  proceeding in which the organization sought exclusive recognition but  failed to file a timely request for arbitration under these rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It was made less than 12 months after a unit determination  following a section 11 proceeding covering such unit or any subdivision  thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The time limits set forth in this paragraph will be applied to  all requests filed on or after October 15, 1963.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No request contemplating an advisory determination as to whether  an employee organization should become or continue to be recognized as  the exclusive representative of employees in any unit will be  entertained if the request is filed within 12 months after a prior  determination of exclusive status has been made pursuant to the Order  with respect to such unit unless the agency has withdrawn exclusive  recognition from an employee organization by reason of its failure to  maintain its compliance with sections 2 and 3(a) of the Order or with  the Standards of Conduct for Employee Organizations and Code of Fair  Labor Practices and the agency advises the Secretary that it has no  objection to a new determination of exclusive representation being made  within the 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No request contemplating an advisory determination as to whether  an employee organization should become or continue to be recognized as  the exclusive representative of employees in any unit will be  entertained during the period within which a signed agreement between an  agency and an employee organization is in force or awaiting approval at  a higher management level, but not to exceed an agreement period of two  years, unless (1) a request for redetermination is filed with the agency  between the 90th and 60th day prior to the terminal date of such  agreement or two years, whichever is earlier, or (2) unusual  circumstances exist which will substantially affect the unit or the  majority representation. When an agreement has been extended more than  60 days before its terminal date, such extension shall not serve as a  basis for the denial of a request under this section submitted in  accordance with the time limitations provided above.
