                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Rules for determining present value. For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 2106, and 2522, the fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in Sec. 1.664-3) is its present value determined under paragraph (d) of this section. The present value determined under this section shall be computed on the basis of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Life contingencies determined as to each life involved, from the values of lx set forth in Table 2000CM contained in Sec. 20.2031-7(d)(7) of this chapter in the case of transfers for which the

The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables of actuarial factors and examples that illustrate the use of the tables in determining the value of remainder interests in property. Section 1.7520-1(c)(2) refers to government publications that provide additional tables of factors and examples of computations for more complex situations. If the computation requires the use of a factor that is not provided in this section, the Commissioner may supply the factor upon a request for a ruling. A request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts including the date of birth of each measuring life, and copies of the relevant documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee. If the Commissioner furnishes the factor, a copy of the letter supplying the factor should be attached to the tax return in which the deduction is claimed. If the Commissioner does not furnish the factor, the taxpayer must furnish a factor computed in accordance with the principles set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Statement supporting deduction required. Any claim for a deduction on any return for the value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust must be supported by a full statement attached to the return showing the computation of the present value of such interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Valuation. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in Sec. 1.664-3) for transfers for which the valuation date is on or after May 1, 2009, is its present value determined under paragraph (e) of this section. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in Sec. 1.664-3) for transfers for which the valuation date is before May 1, 2009, is its present value determined under the following sections:

Sec. 1.7520-1(b) and 1.7520-2(a)(2)) and the appropriate actuarial tables under either paragraph (e)(7) of this section or Sec. 1.664-4A(f)(6), at the option of the donor or the decedent's executor, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, where the donor or decedent's executor is given the option to use the appropriate actuarial tables under either paragraph (e)(7) of this section or Sec. 1.664-4A(f)(6), the donor or decedent's executor must use the same actuarial table with respect to each individual transaction and with respect to all transfers occurring on the valuation date (for example, gift and income tax charitable deductions with respect to the same transfer must be determined based on the same tables, and all assets includible in the gross estate and/or estate tax deductions claimed must be valued based on the same tables).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjusted payout rate. For transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the adjusted payout rate is determined by using the appropriate Table F in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, for the section 7520 interest rate applicable to the transfer. If the interest rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the interest rate is below 4.2 percent or greater than 14 percent, see paragraph (b) of this section. The adjusted payout rate is determined by multiplying the fixed percentage described in Sec. 1.664-3(a)(1)(i)(a) by the factor describing the payout sequence of the trust and the number of months by which the valuation date for the first full taxable year of the trust precedes the first payout date for such taxable year. If the governing instrument does not prescribe when the distribution or distributions shall be made during the taxable year of the trust, see paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of a trust having a payout sequence for which no figures have been provided by the appropriate table, and in the case of a trust that determines the fair market value of the trust assets by taking the average of valuations on more than one date during the taxable year, see paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Period is a term of years. If the period described in Sec. 1.664-3(a)(5) is a term of years, the factor that is used in determining the present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is after November 30, 1983, is the factor under the appropriate adjusted payout rate in Table D of paragraph (e)(6) of this section corresponding to the number of years in the term. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors are provided in Table D, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest is determined by multiplying the net fair market value (as of the appropriate valuation date) of the property placed in trust by the factor determined under this paragraph. For purposes of this section, the valuation date is, in the case of an inter vivos transfer, the date on which the property is transferred to the trust by the donor. However, if an election is made under section 7520 and Sec. 1.7520-2(b) to compute the present value of the charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the date of transfer

falls, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. In the case of a testamentary transfer under section 2055, 2106, or 2624, the valuation date is the date of death, unless the alternate valuation date is elected under section 2032, in which event, and within the limitations set forth in section 2032 and the regulations thereunder, the valuation date is the alternate valuation date. If the decedent's estate elects the alternate valuation date under section 2032 and also elects, under section 7520 and Sec. 1.7520-2(b), to use the interest rate component for one of the 2 months preceding the alternate valuation date, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. The application of this paragraph (e)(4) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. D transfers $100,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust on January 1. The trust instrument requires that the trust pay 8 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets as of January 1st for a term of 12 years to D in quarterly payments (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31). The section 7520 rate for January (the month that the transfer occurred) is 9.6 percent. Under Table F(9.6) in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the appropriate adjustment factor is .944628 for quarterly payments payable at the end of each quarter. The adjusted payout rate is 7.557 (8%x .944628). Based on the remainder factors in Table D in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the present value of the remainder interest is $38,950.30, computed as follows:

(i) If the period described in Sec. 1.664-3(a)(5) is the life of one individual, the factor that is used in determining the present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is on or after May 1, 2009, is the factor in Table U(1) in paragraph (e)(7) of this section under the appropriate adjusted payout. For purposes of the computations described in this paragraph (e)(5), the age of an individual is the age of that individual at the individual's nearest birthday. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors are provided in the appropriate table, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest is determined by multiplying the net fair market value (as of the valuation date as determined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section) of the property placed in trust by the factor determined under this paragraph (e)(5). If the adjusted payout rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(7) of this section.

The trust instrument requires that the trust pay to A semiannually (on June 30 and December 31) 8 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets as of January 1st during A's life. The section 7520 rate for January is 6.6 percent. Under Table F(6.6) in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the appropriate adjustment factor is .953317 for semiannual payments payable at the end of the semiannual period. The adjusted payout rate is 7.627% (8% x .953317). Based on the remainder factors in Table U(1) in this section, the present value of the remainder interest is $11,075.00, computed as follows:

treatment of excess distributions of trusts applicable to taxable years</p><p class="depth0">beginning before january 1, 1969


Sec. 1.665(a)-0  Excess distributions by trusts; scope of subpart D.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, in the case of trusts other than foreign trusts created by U.S. persons, is designed generally to prevent a shift of tax burden to a trust from a beneficiary or beneficiaries. In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, subpart D is designed to prevent certain other tax avoidance possibilities. To accomplish these ends, subpart D provides special rules for treatment of amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed by a complex trust (subject to subpart C (section 661 and following) of such part I) in any year in excess of distributable net income for that year. Such an excess distribution is defined as an accumulation distribution, subject to the limitations in section 665 (b) or (c). An accumulation distribution, in the case of a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, is ``thrown back'' to each of the 5 preceding years in inverse order. In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person such an accumulation distribution is ``thrown back,'' in inverse order, to each of the preceding years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. That is, an accumulation distribution will be taxed to the beneficiaries of the trust in the year the distribution is made or required, but, in general, only to the extent of the distributable net income of those years which was not in fact distributed. However, with respect to a distribution by a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the resulting tax will not be greater than the aggregate of the taxes that would have been attributable to the amount thrown back to previous years had they been included in gross income of the beneficiaries in those years. In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the resulting tax is computed under the provisions of section 669. To prevent double taxation, both in the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, and a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the beneficiaries receive a credit for any taxes previously paid by the trust which are attributable to the excess thrown back and which are creditable under the provisions of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Subpart D does not apply to any estate.

Sec. 1.665(a)-1  Undistributed net income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term undistributed net income means for any taxable year the distributable net income of the trust for that year as determined under section 643(a), less:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of income required to be distributed currently and any other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be distributed to beneficiaries in the taxable year as specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 661(a), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of taxes imposed on the trust, as defined in Sec. 1.665(d)-1.</p><p class="depth0">The application of the rule in this paragraph to the first year of a trust in which income is accumulated may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that under the terms of the trust, $10,000 of income is required to be distributed currently to A and the trustee has discretion to make additional distributions to A. During the taxable year 1954 the trust had distributable net income of $30,100 derived from royalties and the trustee made distributions of $20,000 to A. The taxable income of the trust is $10,000 on which a tax of $2,640 is paid. The undistributed net income of the trust as of the close of the taxable year 1954 is $7,460 computed as follows:
Distributable net income.....................................    $30,100Less:</p><p class="depth0">Income currently distributable to A.............    $10,000</p><p class="depth0">Other amounts distributed to A..................     10,000</p><p class="depth0">Taxes imposed on the trust (see Sec. 1.665(d)-      2,640</p><p class="depth0">1).............................................</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">22,640</p><p class="depth0">------------</p><p class="depth0">Undistributed net income.................................      7,460</p><p class="depth0">See also paragraphs (e)(1) and (f)(1) of Sec. 1.668(b)-2 for additional illustrations of the application of the rule in this paragraph to the first year of a trust in which income is accumulated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The undistributed net income of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person for any taxable year is the distributable net income of such trust (see Sec. 1.643(a)-6 and the examples set forth in paragraph (b) thereof), less:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of income required to be distributed currently and any other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be distributed to beneficiaries in the taxable year as specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 661(a), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of taxes imposed on such trust by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, which are attributable to items of income which are required to be included in such distributable net income. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of taxes imposed on the trust (for any taxable year), by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code is the amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 871 which is properly allocable to the undistributed portion of the distributable net income. See Sec. 1.665(d)-1. The amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 871 is the difference between the total tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of that section on the foreign trust created by a U.S. person for the year and the amount which would have been imposed on such trust had all the distributable net income, as determined under section 643(a), been distributed. The application of the rule in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A trust was created in 1952 under the laws of Country X by the transfer to a trustee in Country X of money or property by a U.S. person. The entire trust constitutes a foreign trust created by a U.S. person. The governing instrument of the trust provides that $7,000 of income is required to be distributed currently to a U.S. beneficiary and gives the trustee discretion to make additional distributions to the beneficiary. During the taxable year 1963 the trust had income of $10,000 from dividends of a U.S. corporation (on which Federal income taxes of $3,000 were imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 871 and withheld under section 1441 resulting in the receipt by the trust of cash in the amount of $7,000), $20,000 in capital gains from the sale of stock of a Country Y corporation, and $30,000 from dividends of a Country X corporation, none of the gross income of which was derived from sources within the United States. The trustee did not file a U.S. income tax return for the taxable year 1963. The distributable net income of the trust before distributions to the beneficiary for 1963 is $60,000 ($57,000 of which is cash). During 1963 the trustee made distributions to the U.S. beneficiary equaling one-half of the trust's distributable net income or $30,000. Thus, the U.S. beneficiary is treated as having had distributed to him $5,000 (composed of $3,500 as a cash distribution and $1,500 as the tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 871 and withheld under section 1441), representing one-half of the income from U.S. sources; $10,000 in cash, representing one-half of the capital gains from the sale of stock of the Country Y corporation; and $15,000 in cash, representing one-half of the income from Country X sources for a total of $30,000. The undistributed net income of the trust at the close of taxable year 1963 is $28,500 computed as follows:

The facts are the same as in example 1 except that property has been transferred to the trust by a person other than a U.S. person, and during 1963 the foreign trust created by a U.S. person was 60 percent of the entire foreign trust.

(In computing the amount of an accumulation distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, there is taken into account amounts applied or distributed for the support of a dependent under the circumstances specified in section 677(b) or section 678(c) out of corpus or out of other than income for the taxable year and amounts used to discharge or satisfy any person's legal obligation as that term is used in Sec. 1.662(a)-4.)

This may result from the fact that expenses allocable to corpus are taken into account in determining taxable income and hence distributable net income. However, in the case of a trust other than

Sec. 1.665(b)-2  Exclusions from accumulation distributions in thecase of trusts (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, certain amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to a beneficiary are excluded under section 665(b) in determining whether there is an accumulation distribution for the purposes of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code. These exclusions are solely for the purpose of determining the amount allocable to preceding years under section 666 and in no way affect the determination under subpart C (section 661 and following) of such part I of the beneficiary's tax liability for the year of distribution. Further, amounts excluded from accumulation distributions do not reduce the amount of undistributed net income for the 5 years preceding the year of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The amounts excluded from the computation of an accumulation distribution are discussed in the following subparagraphs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Distributions from accumulations while a beneficiary is under 21. (i) The first exception to the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to a beneficiary who was under 21 years of age or unborn when it was accumulated. A distribution is to be considered as so paid, credited, or

required to be distributed to the extent, and only to the extent, that there is no undistributed net income for taxable years preceding the year of distribution other than undistributed net income accumulated while the beneficiary was under 21. If a distribution can be made from income accumulated either before or after a beneficiary reaches 21, it will be considered as made from the most recently accumulated income, and it will be so considered even though the governing instrument directs that distributions be charged first against the earliest accumulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The first exception to the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed to a beneficiary who was under 21 years of age or unborn when it was accumulated. A distribution is to be considered as so paid, credited, or

required to be distributed to the extent, and only to the extent, that there is no undistributed net income for taxable years preceding the year of distribution other than undistributed net income accumulated while the beneficiary was under 21. If a distribution can be made from income accumulated either before or after a beneficiary reaches 21, it will be considered as made from the most recently accumulated income, and it will be so considered even though the governing instrument directs that distributions be charged first against the earliest accumulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As was indicated in paragraph (a) of this section, a distribution of an amount excepted from the definition of an accumulation distribution will not reduce undistributed net income for the purpose of determining the effect of a future accumulation distribution. Thus, a distribution to a beneficiary of income accumulated before he reached 21 would not reduce the undistributed net income includible in a future accumulation distribution to another beneficiary. However, all future distributions to the same beneficiary, or to another beneficiary to whom a distribution would be excepted under the provisions of this subparagraph, would be excepted from the definition of an accumulation distribution to the extent that they could not be paid, credited, or required to be distributed from other accumulated income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following examples illustrate the application of the foregoing rules of this subparagraph (in each of these examples it is assumed that the exceptions in section 665(b) (2), (3), and (4) do not apply):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Income is to be accumulated until A reaches 21 when the corpus and accumulated income are to be distributed to him. The distribution is not an accumulation distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Income is to be accumulated until A is 21, when it is to be distributed to him but the corpus is to remain in trust. A distribution of the accumulated income to A when he reaches 21 is not an accumulation distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Income is to be accumulated and added to corpus until A reaches 21, when he is to receive one-third of the corpus (including accumulations). Thereafter all the income is to be paid to A until he is 23 when the remaining corpus (including accumulations) is to be paid to him. If A dies under that age any undistributed portion is to be paid to B. Distributions to A at 21 and 23 out of accumulations are not accumulation distributions even though they include accumulated income. However, if A died at the age of 22, when B was 23, a distribution to B would be an accumulation distribution to the extent of income accumulations since B reached 21, and the amount of undistributed net income includible in the distribution will not be reduced by the previous distribution to A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Income is to be accumulated and added to corpus until A is 21. After he is 21, he is entitled to all the income and, in addition, to distributions of corpus in the discretion of the trustee. When he reaches 25 he is entitled to the corpus. Distributions to A are not accumulation distributions, whether they are discretionary or upon termination of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The facts are the same as in the preceding example, except that income is to be accumulated until A is 23. Distributions to A are accumulation distributions to the extent of income accumulated after A reached 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Income may be distributed among a testator's children or accumulated and added to corpus until the youngest child is 21, when the corpus is to be distributed to the testator's then living descendants. Upon termination of the trust, the corpus is distributed to A, age 21; B, age 23; and C, the child of a deceased child, age 3. The distributions to A and C are not accumulation distributions. The distribution to B is an accumulation distribution to the extent of income accumulated after he reaches 21. (If the terms of the trust were such that it was subject to the separate share treatment under section 663(c), the distribution to B would be an accumulation distribution only to the extent of income accumulated for B's separate share since he reached 21.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Income may be distributed to A or accumulated and added to corpus during A's life. Upon the death of A the corpus is to be distributed to B. B is 23 at A's death. The distribution is an accumulation distribution to the extent

of income accumulated since B reached 21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Emergency distributions. The second exclusion from the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts properly paid or credited to a beneficiary to meet his emergency needs. Whether or not a distribution falls within this exclusion depends upon the facts and circumstances causing the distribution. A distribution based upon an unforeseen or unforeseeable combination of circumstances requiring immediate help to the beneficiary would qualify for the exclusion. However, the beneficiary must be in actual need of the distribution and the fact that he had other sufficient resources would tend to negate the conclusion that a distribution was to meet his emergency needs. Ordinary distributions for the support, maintenance, or education of the beneficiary would not qualify for the exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain distributions at specified ages. The third exclusion from the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts properly paid or credited to a beneficiary upon the beneficiary's attaining a specified age or ages; provided, (i) the total number of such distributions with respect to that beneficiary cannot exceed 4; (ii) the period between each such distribution is 4 years or more; and (iii) on January 1, 1954, such distributions were required by the specific terms of the governing instrument. Any discretionary invasion of corpus at other times is not excluded under this subparagraph, but does not affect the status of distributions that would otherwise be excluded. If more than four distributions are required to be made to a particular beneficiary at specified ages if he survives to receive them, none of the distributions will be excluded, even though the beneficiary dies before he receives more than four. On the other hand, a direction to make additional distributions to a remainderman will not affect the status of distributions required to be made to the primary beneficiary. For example, a trust agreement provided on January 1, 1954, that when A reached age 25 he would receive one-eighth of the corpus and accumulated income, as then constituted, and similar distributions at ages 30, 35, and 40. It also provided for similar distributions to B after A's death, and for additional discretionary distributions to both A and B. Required distributions to both A and B are excluded, regardless of whether discretionary distributions are made, but discretionary distributions are not excluded. On the other hand, if an additional distribution to A was directed when he reached 45, no distributions to him would be excluded, regardless of when he died.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain final distributions. (i) The last exception to the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts properly paid or credited to a beneficiary as a final distribution of a trust if the final distribution is made more than 9 years after the date of the last transfer to such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The last exception to the definition of an accumulation distribution is for amounts properly paid or credited to a beneficiary as a final distribution of a trust if the final distribution is made more than 9 years after the date of the last transfer to such trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term last transfer to such trust includes only transfers, whether by the original grantor or by a third person, made with a donative intent. A transfer arising out of a property right held by the trust is excluded, such as a transfer by a debtor in satisfaction of his indebtedness, or a distribution in liquidation or reorganization of a corporation. If the terms of two or more trusts include cross-remainders on the deaths of life beneficiaries, the donative transfers occurred at the time the trusts were created. The addition of the corpus of one trust to that of another when a remainder falls in is therefore not a new transfer within the meaning of section 665(b)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For example, under the terms of a trust created July 1, 1950, with an original corpus of $100,000, by H for the benefit of his wife, W, the income of the trust is to be accumulated and added to corpus. Upon the expiration of a 10-year period, the trust is to terminate and its assets, including all accumulated income, are to be distributed to W. No transfers were made by H or other persons to the trust after it was created. Both the trust and W file returns on the calendar year basis. In accordance with its terms, the trust terminated on June 30, 1960, and on August 1, 1960, the trustee made a final distribution of the assets of the trust to W, consisting of investments derived from $100,000 of donated principal, accumulated income of $30,000 attributable to the period July 1, 1950,

through December 31, 1959, and income of $3,000 attributable to the period the trust was in existence during 1960. Subpart D is inapplicable to the $3,000 of income of the trust for 1960 since that amount would be deductible by the trust and includible in W's gross income for that year to the extent provided in subpart C. However, the balance of the distribution will qualify as an exclusion from the provisions of subpart D.

Sec. 1.665(c)-1  Accumulation distributions of certain foreign trusts;in general.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the term accumulation distribution for any taxable year means an amount by which the amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed within the meaning of section 661(a)(2) for that year exceed the distributable net income (determined under section 643(a)) of the trust, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of income required to be distributed currently. (In computing the amount of an accumulation distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, there is taken into account amounts applied or distributed for the support of a dependent under circumstances specified in section 677(b) and section 678(c) out of corpus or out of other than income for the taxable year and amounts used to discharge or satisfy any person's legal obligation as that term is used in Sec. 1.662(a)-4.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Although amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed under section 661(a)(2) do not exceed the income of the trust during the taxable year, an accumulation distribution may result if such amounts exceed distributable net income reduced (but not below zero) by the amount required to be distributed currently. This may result from the fact that expenses allocable to corpus are taken into account in determining taxable income and hence distributable net income. However, the provisions of subpart D will not apply unless there is undistributed net income in at least one of the preceding taxable years which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954.

Sec. 1.665(c)-2  Indirect payments to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of section 665 any amount paid to a U.S. person which is from a payor who is not a U.S. person and which is derived directly or indirectly from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person shall be deemed in the year of payment to the U.S. person to have been directly paid to the U.S. person by the trust. For example, if a nonresident alien receives a distribution from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and then pays the amount of the distribution over to a U.S. person, the payment of such amount to the U.S. person represents an accumulation distribution to the U.S. person from the trust to the extent that the amount received would have been an accumulation distribution had the trust paid the amount directly to the U.S. person in the year in which the payment was received by the U.S. person. This section also applies in a case where a nonresident alien receives indirectly an accumulation distribution from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and then pays it over to a U.S. person. An example of such a transaction is one where the foreign trust created by a U.S. person makes the distribution to an intervening foreign trust created by either a U.S. person or a person other than a U.S. person and the intervening trust distributes the amount received to a nonresident alien who in turn pays it over to a U.S. person. Under these circumstances, it is deemed that the payment received by the U.S. person was

received directly from a foreign trust created by a U.S. person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Limitation. In the case of a distribution to a beneficiary who is a U.S. person, paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if the distribution is received by such beneficiary under circumstances indicating lack of intent on the part of the parties to circumvent the purposes for which section 7 of the Revenue Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 985) was enacted.

Sec. 1.665(d)-1  Taxes imposed on the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, the term taxes imposed on the trust means (for any taxable year) the amount of Federal income taxes which are properly allocable to the undistributed portion of the distributable net income. This amount is the difference between the total taxes of the trust for the year and the amount which would have been paid by the trust had all of the distributable net income, as determined under section 643(a), been distributed. Thus, in determining the amount of taxes imposed on the trust for the purposes of subpart D, there is excluded the portion of the taxes paid by the trust which is attributable to items of gross income which are not includible in distributable net income, such as capital gains allocable to corpus. The rule stated in this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under the terms of a trust which reports on the calendar year basis the income may be accumulated or distributed to A in the discretion of the trustee and capital gains are allocable to corpus.

Sec. 1.665(e)-1  Preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definition. For purposes of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the term preceding taxable year does not include any taxable year to which such part I does not apply. See section 683 and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the provisions of such subpart D may not, in general, be applied to any taxable year which begins before 1954 or ends before

August 17, 1954. For example, if a trust (reporting on the calendar year basis) makes a distribution during the calendar year 1955 of income accumulated during prior years and the distribution exceeds the distributable net income of 1955, the excess distribution may be allocated under such subpart D to 1954, but it may not be allocated to 1953 and preceding years, since the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies to those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Simple trusts subject to subpart D. An accumulation distribution may be properly allocated to a preceding taxable year in which the trust qualified as a simple trust (that is, qualified for treatment under subpart B (section 651 and following) of such part I). In such event, the trust is treated for such preceding taxable year in all respects as if it were a trust to which subpart C (section 661 and following) of such part I applies. An example of such a circumstance would be in the case of a trust (required under the trust instrument to distribute all of its income currently) which received in the preceding taxable year extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the trustee in good faith allocated to corpus, but which are subsequently determined to be currently distributable to the beneficiary. See section 643(a)(4) and Sec. 1.643(a)-4. The trust would qualify for treatment under such subpart C for the year of distribution of the extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends, because the distribution is not out of income of the current taxable year and would be treated as other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be distributed for such taxable year within the meaning of section 661(a)(2). Also, in the case of a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the distribution would qualify as an accumulation distribution for the purposes of such subpart D if in excess of $2,000 and not excepted under section 665(b) and the regulations thereunder. In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the distribution, regardless of the amount, would qualify as an accumulation distribution for the purposes of subpart D. For the purposes only of such subpart D, the trust would be treated as subject to the provisions of such subpart C for the preceding taxable year in which the extraordinary or taxable stock dividends were received and in computing undistributed net income for such preceding year, the extraordinary or taxable stock dividends would be included in distributable net income under section 643(a). The rule stated in the preceding sentence would also apply if the distribution in the later year were made out of corpus without regard to a determination that the extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends in question were currently distributable to the beneficiary.

The ``taxes imposed on the trust'' are allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> There is first allocated to each separate share that portion of the ``taxes imposed on the trust'', computed before the allowance of credits under section 642(a), which bears the same relation to the total that the distributable net income of the separate share bears to the distributable net income of the trust, adjusted for this purpose as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is excluded from distributable net income of the trust and of each separate share any tax-exempt interest, foreign income of a foreign trust, and excluded dividends, to the extent such amounts are included in distributable net income pursuant to section 643(a) (5), (6), and (7); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The distributable net income of the trust is reduced by any deductions allowable under section 661 for amounts paid, credited, or required to be distributed during the taxable year, and the distributable net income of each separate share is reduced by any such deduction allocable to that share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The taxes so determined for each separate share are then reduced by that portion of the credits against tax allowable to the trust under section 642(a) in computing the ``taxes imposed on the trust'' which bear the same relation to the total that the items of income allocable to the separate share with respect to which the credit is allowed bear to the total of such items of the trust. The amount of taxes imposed on the trust allocable to a separate share as so determined is then reduced by the amount of the taxes allowed under sections 667 and 668 as a credit to a beneficiary of the separate share on account of any accumulation distribution determined for any taxable year intervening between the year for which the determination is made and the year of an accumulation distribution with respect to which the determination is made.

Sec. 1.666(a)-1A  Amount allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. In the case of a trust that is subject to subpart C of part I of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to estates and trusts that may accumulate income or that distribute corpus), section 666(a) prescribes rules for determining the taxable years from which an accumulation distribution will be deemed to have been made and the extent to which the accumulation distribution is considered to consist of undistributed net income. In general, an accumulation distribution made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, is deemed to have been made first from the earliest preceding taxable year of the trust for which there is undistributed net income. An accumulation distribution made in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, is deemed to have been made first from the most recent preceding taxable year of the trust for which there is undistributed net income. See Sec. 1.665(e)-1A for the definition of ``preceding taxable year.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Distributions by domestic trusts--(1) Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1973. An accumulation distribution made by a trust (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person) in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1973, is allocated to the preceding taxable years of the trust (defined in Sec. 1.665(e)-1A(a)(1)(ii) as those beginning after December 31, 1968) according to the amount of undistributed net income of the trust for such years. For this purpose, an accumulation distribution is first to be allocated to the earliest such preceding taxable year in which there is undistributed net income and shall then be allocated, beginning with the next earliest, to any remaining preceding taxable years of the trust. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to the earliest preceding taxable year is the amount of the undistributed net income for that preceding taxable year. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to any preceding taxable year subsequent to the earliest such preceding taxable year is the excess of the accumulation distribution over the aggregate of the undistributed net income for all earlier preceding taxable years. See paragraph (d) of this section for adjustments to undistributed net income for prior distributions. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1977, a domestic trust reporting on the calendar year basis makes an accumulation distribution of $33,000. Therefore, years before 1969 are ignored. In 1969, the trust had $6,000 of undistributed net income; in 1970, $4,000; in 1971, none; in 1972, $7,000; in 1973, $5,000; in 1974, $8,000; in 1975, $6,000; and $4,000 in 1976. The accumulation distribution is deemed distributed $6,000 in 1969, $4,000 in 1970, none in 1971, $7,000 in 1972, $5,000 in 1973, $8,000 in 1974, and $3,000 in 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1974. If a trust (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person) makes an accumulation distribution in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1974, the distribution will be deemed distributed in the same manner as accumulation distributions qualifying under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, except that the first year to which the distribution may be thrown back cannot be earlier than the fifth taxable year of the trust

preceding the year in which the accumulation distribution is made. Thus, for example, in the case of an accumulation distribution made in the taxable year of a domestic trust which begins on January 1, 1972, the taxable year of the trust beginning on January 1, 1967, would be the first year in which the distribution was deemed made, assuming that there was undistributed net income for 1967. See also Sec. 1.665(e)-1A(a)(1). The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1973, a domestic trust, reporting on the calendar year basis, makes an accumulation distribution of $25,000.

The accumulation distribution is deemed distributed in the amounts of $7,000 in 1968, none in 1969, $12,000 in 1970, $4,000 in 1971, and $2,000 in 1972.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1968, and before January 1, 1970.

If a foreign trust created by a U.S. person makes an accumulation distribution in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the distribution is allocated to the trust's preceding taxable years (defined in Sec. 1.665(e)-1A(a)(2) as those beginning after Dec. 31, 1953, and ending after Aug. 16, 1954) according to the amount of undistributed net income of the trust for such years. For this purpose, an accumulation distribution is first allocated to the earliest such preceding taxable year in which there is undistributed net income and shall then be allocated in turn, beginning with the next earliest, to any remaining preceding taxable years of the trust. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to the earliest preceding taxable year is the amount of the undistributed net income for that preceding taxable year. The portion of the accumulation distribution allocated to any preceding taxable year subsequent to the earliest such preceding taxable year is the excess of the accumulation distribution over the aggregate of the undistributed net income for all earlier preceding taxable years. See paragraph (d) of this section for adjustments to undistributed net income for prior distributions. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In 1971, a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, reporting on the calendar year basis, makes an accumulation distribution of $50,000.

If a trust that is in part a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and in part a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person makes an accumulation distribution in any year after December 31, 1969, the distribution is deemed made from the undistributed net income of the foreign trust created by a U.S. person in the proportion that the total undistributed net income for all preceding years of the foreign trust created by the U.S. person bears to the total undistributed net income for all years of the entire foreign trust. In addition, such distribution is deemed made from the undistributed net income of the foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person in the proportion that the total undistributed net income for all preceding years of the foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person bears to the total undistributed net income for all years of the entire foreign trust. Accordingly, an accumulation distribution of such a trust is composed of two portions with one portion relating to the undistributed net income of the

foreign trust created by the U.S. person and the other portion relating to the undistributed net income of the foreign trust created by the person other than a U.S. person. For these purposes, each portion of an accumulation distribution made in any taxable year is first allocated to each of such preceding taxable years in turn, beginning with the earliest preceding taxable year, as defined in Sec. 1.665(e)-1A(a), of the applicable foreign trusts, to the extent of the undistributed net income for the such trust for each of those years. Thus, each portion of an accumulation distribution is deemed to have been made from the earliest accumulated income of the applicable trust. If the foreign trust created by a U.S. person makes an accumulation distribution in any year beginning after December 31, 1969, the distribution is included in the beneficiary's income for that year to the extent of the undistributed net income of the trust for the trust's preceding taxable years which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A trust is created in 1962 under the laws of Country X by the transfer to a trustee in Country X of property by both a U.S. person and a person other than a U.S. person. Both the trust and the only beneficiary of the trust (who is a U.S. person) report their taxable income on a calendar year basis. On March 31, 1974, the trust makes an accumulation distribution of $150,000 to the beneficiary. The distributable net income of both the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person for each year is computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.643(d)-1 and the undistributed net income for each portion of the trust for each year is computed as described in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.665(a)-1A. For taxable years 1962 through 1973, the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person had the following amounts of undistributed net income:

Pursuant to this paragraph, the accumulation distribution in the amount of $100,000 from the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a U.S. person is included in the beneficiary's income for 1974, as the amount represents undistributed net income of the trust for the trust's preceding taxable years which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. The accumulation distribution in the amount of $50,000 from the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person is included in the beneficiary's income for 1974 to the extent of the undistributed net income of the trust for the preceding years beginning after December 31, 1968. Accordingly, with respect to the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person, only the undistributed net income for the years 1969 through 1973, which totals $39,000,

is includible in the beneficiary's income for 1974. Thus, of the $150,000 distribution made in 1974, the beneficiary is required to include a total of $139,000 in his income for 1974. The balance of $11,000 is deemed to represent a distribution of corpus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1968, and before January 1, 1970.

For the purposes of allocating to any preceding taxable year an accumulation distribution of the taxable year, the undistributed net income of such preceding taxable year is reduced by the amount from such year deemed distributed in any accumulation distribution of undistributed net income made in any taxable year intervening between such preceding taxable year and the taxable year. Accordingly, for example, if a trust has undistributed net income for 1974 and makes accumulation distributions during the taxable years 1978 and 1979, in determining that part of the 1979 accumulation distribution that is thrown back to 1974 the undistributed net income for 1974 is first reduced by the amount of the undistributed net income for 1974 deemed distributed in the 1978 accumulation distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rule when no undistributed net income. If, before the application of the provisions of subpart D to an accumulation distribution for the taxable year, there is no undistributed net income for a preceding taxable year, then no portion of the accumulation distribution is undistributed net income deemed distributed on the last day of such preceding taxable year. Thus, if an accumulation distribution is made during the taxable year 1975 from a trust whose earliest preceding taxable year is taxable year 1970, and the trust had no undistributed net income for 1970, then no portion of the 1975 accumulation distribution is undistributed net income deemed distributed on the last day of 1970.

Sec. 1.666(d)-1A  Information required from trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Adequate records required. For all taxable years of a trust, the trustee must retain copies of the trust's income tax return as well as information pertaining to any adjustments in the tax shown as due on the return. The trustee shall also keep the records of the trust required to be retained by section 6001 and the regulations thereunder for each taxable year as to which the period of limitations on assessment of tax under section 6501 has not expired. If the trustee fails to produce such copies and records, and such failure is due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the trustee or any predecessor trustee, the trustee may reconstruct the amount of corpus, accumulated income, etc., from competent sources (including, to the extent permissible, Internal Revenue Service records). To the extent that an accurate reconstruction can be made for a taxable year, the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed satisfied for such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rule when information is not available--(1) Accumulation distributions. If adequate records (as required by paragraph (a) of this section) are not available to determine the proper application of subpart D to an accumulation distribution made in a taxable year by a trust, such accumulation distribution

shall be deemed to consist of undistributed net income earned during the earliest preceding taxable year (as defined in Sec. 1.665(e)-1A) of the trust in which it can be established that the trust was in existence. If adequate records are available for some years, but not for others, the accumulation distribution shall be allocated first to the earliest preceding taxable year of the trust for which there are adequate records and then to each subsequent preceding taxable year for which there are adequate records. To the extent that the distribution is not allocated in such manner to years for which adequate records are available, it will be deemed distributed on the last day of the earliest preceding taxable year of the trust in which it is established that the trust was in existence and for which the trust has no records. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A trust makes a distribution in 1975 of $100,000. The trustee has adequate records for 1973, 1974, and 1975. The records show that the trust is on the calendar year basis, had distributable net income in 1975 of $20,000, and undistributed net income in 1974 of $15,000, and in 1973 of $16,000. The trustee has no other records of the trust except for a copy of the trust instrument showing that the trust was established on January 1, 1965. He establishes that the loss of the records was due to circumstances beyond his control. Since the distribution is made in 1975, the earliest ``preceding taxable year'', as defined in Sec. 1.665(e)-1A, is 1969. Since $80,000 of the distribution is an accumulation distribution, and $31,000 thereof is allocated to 1974 and 1973, $49,000 is deemed to have been distributed on the last day of 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxes. (i) If an amount is deemed under this paragraph to be undistributed net income allocated to a preceding taxable year for which adequate records are not available, there shall be deemed to be ``taxes imposed on the trust'' for such preceding taxable year an amount equal to the taxes that the trust would have paid if the deemed undistributed net income were the amount remaining when the taxes were subtracted from taxable income of the trust for such year. For example, assume that an accumulation distribution in 1975 of $100,000 is deemed to be undistributed net income from 1971, and that the taxable income required to produce $100,000 after taxes in 1971 would be $284,966. Therefore the amount deemed to be ``taxes imposed on the trust'' for such preceding taxable year is $184,966.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an amount is deemed under this paragraph to be undistributed net income allocated to a preceding taxable year for which adequate records are not available, there shall be deemed to be ``taxes imposed on the trust'' for such preceding taxable year an amount equal to the taxes that the trust would have paid if the deemed undistributed net income were the amount remaining when the taxes were subtracted from taxable income of the trust for such year. For example, assume that an accumulation distribution in 1975 of $100,000 is deemed to be undistributed net income from 1971, and that the taxable income required to produce $100,000 after taxes in 1971 would be $284,966.

For this purpose, an accumulation distribution made in any taxable year is allocated to each of the 5 preceding taxable years in turn, beginning with the most recent year, to the extent of the undistributed net income of each of those years.

It is therefore necessary to determine the extent to which there is undistributed net income for such preceding taxable years. For this purpose, an accumulation distribution made in any taxable year is first allocated to each of such preceding taxable years in turn, beginning with the most recent year, to the extent of the undistributed net income of each of those years. Thus, an accumulation distribution is deemed to have been made from the most recently accumulated income of the trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a trust that is in part a foreign trust created by a U.S. person and in

In addition, such distribution is deemed made from the undistributed net income of the foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person in the proportion that the total undistributed net income for all preceding years of the foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person bears to the total undistributed net income for all years of the entire foreign trust. Accordingly, an accumulation distribution of such a trust is composed of two portions with one portion relating to the undistributed net income of the foreign trust created by the U.S. person and the other portion relating to the undistributed net income of the foreign trust created by the person other than a U.S. person. For these purposes, each portion of an accumulation distribution made in any taxable year is first allocated to each of such preceding taxable years in turn, beginning with the most recent year, to the extent of the undistributed net income for the applicable foreign trust for each of those years. Thus, each portion of an accumulation distribution is deemed to have been made from the most recently accumulated income of the applicable trust. If the foreign trust created by a U.S. person makes an accumulation distribution in any year after December 31, 1962, the distribution is included in the beneficiary's gross income for that year to the extent of the undistributed net income of the trust for the trust's preceding taxable years which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. If the foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person makes an accumulation distribution in any taxable year, the distribution is included in the beneficiary's gross income for that year to the extent of the undistributed net income of the trust for the preceding 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If, before the application of the provisions of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, to an accumulation distribution for the taxable year, there is no undistributed net income for a preceding taxable year, then no portion of the accumulation distribution is deemed distributed on the last day of such preceding taxable year. Thus, if an accumulation distribution is made during the taxable year 1960 and the trust had no undistributed net income for the taxable year 1959, then no portion of the 1960 accumulation distribution is deemed distributed on the last day of 1959. For purposes of subpart D, the term 5 preceding taxable years includes only the 5 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the accumulation distribution is made and which are subject to part I (section 641 and following) of such subchapter J even though the trust has no undistributed net income during one or more of those years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the accumulation distribution in the amount of $100,000 from the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a U.S. person is included in the beneficiary's gross income for 1964, as this amount represents undistributed net income of the trust for the trust's preceding taxable years which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. The accumulation distribution in the amount of $50,000 from the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person is included in the beneficiary's gross income for 1964 to the extent of the undistributed net income of the trust for the preceding 5 years. Accordingly, with respect to the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person only the undistributed net income for the years 1959 through 1963 which totals $39,000 is includible in the beneficiary's gross income for 1964. Thus, of the $150,000 distribution made in 1964, the beneficiary is required to include a total of $139,000 in his gross income for 1964.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4.

Pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, only $11,000 of the accumulation distribution in the amount of $15,000 from the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a U.S. person is includible in the beneficiary's gross income for 1965 as the $11,000 amount represents undistributed net income of the trust for the trust's preceding taxable years which began after December 31, 1953, and ended after August 16, 1954. The accumulation distribution in the amount of $10,000 from the portion of the trust which is a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person is included in the beneficiary's gross income for 1965 to the extent of the undistributed net income of the trust for the preceding 5 years. Accordingly, the entire $10,000 (representing the undistributed net income for the year 1964) is includible in the beneficiary's gross income for 1965. Thus, of the $25,000 distribution made in 1965, the beneficiary is required to include a total of $21,000 in his gross income for 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For the purposes of allocating to any preceding taxable year an accumulation distribution of the taxable year, the undistributed net income of such preceding taxable year is computed without regard to the accumulation distribution of the taxable year or of taxable years following the taxable year. However, accumulation distributions of any taxable years intervening between such preceding taxable year and the taxable year are taken into account. Accordingly, if a trust has undistributed net income for the taxable year 1954 and makes an accumulation distribution during the taxable year 1955, the undistributed net income for 1954 is computed without regard to the accumulation distribution for 1955 or any subsequent year. If the trust makes a further accumulation distribution for 1956, the undistributed net income for 1954 is computed without regard to the accumulation distribution for 1956 or subsequent years; but in determining the undistributed net income for 1954 for purposes of the 1956 accumulation distribution the accumulation distribution for 1955 will be taken into account.

For example, a trust has taxable income of $11,032 (not including any capital gains) and undistributed net income of $8,000 for the taxable year 1954. The taxes imposed on the trust are $3,032. During the taxable year 1955, an accumulation distribution of $8,000 is made to the beneficiary, which is deemed under Sec. 1.666(a)-1 to have been distributed on the last day of 1954. The taxes imposed on the trust for 1954 of $3,032 are also deemed to have been distributed on the last day of 1954 since the 1955 accumulation distribution is not less than the 1954 undistributed net income.

Accordingly, the accumulation distribution of $6,420 made during the taxable year 1956 is, under section 666(a), deemed a distribution to X on December 31, 1954, within the meaning of section 661(a)(2). Since this accumulation distribution is less than the 1954 adjusted undistributed net income of $7,427, the trust is deemed under section 666(c) also to have distributed on December 31, 1954, a portion of the taxes imposed on the trust for 1954. The total amount deemed to be distributed on December 31, 1954, with respect to the accumulation distribution made in 1956, is $8,687, computed as follows:
