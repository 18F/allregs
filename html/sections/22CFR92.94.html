                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Officers should make prompt and courteous replies to all inquiries  regarding the service of legal process or documents of like nature, and  should render such assistance as they properly   can to the court and to interested parties. Such assistance could  include furnishing information as to the standard procedure of the  locality for service of legal papers, with the name and address of the  local office having a bailiff authorized to effect and make return of  service; it could include furnishing a list of local attorneys capable  of making necessary arrangements; or it could, where appropriate,  include a suggestion that the request of the American court might be  presented to the foreign judicial authorities in the form of letters  rogatory (see definition, Sec. 92.54, and procedures, Sec. 92.66 (b)).  If the person upon whom the process is intended to be served is known to  be willing to accept service, or if it is clear that it would be in his  interest at least to be informed of the matter, the consular officer may  suggest to the interested parties in the United States the drawings up  of papers for voluntary execution by such person, such as a waiver of  service or a document which would be acceptable to the American court to  signify the person's entering an appearance in the action pending  therein.</p>
