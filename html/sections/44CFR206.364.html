                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. (1) The local government shall submit an application for a Community Disaster Loan through the GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see Sec. 206.367(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The local government shall submit an application for a Community Disaster Loan through the GAR.

The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy for the submission. The Governor's Authorized Representative may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Financial requirements. (1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see Sec. 206.364(b)(2)) and shall include a Summary of Revenue

Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results--Cash Position, a Debt History, Tax Assessment Data, Financial Projections, Other Information, a Certification, and the Assurances listed on the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see Sec. 206.364(b)(2)) and shall include a Summary of Revenue

Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results--Cash Position, a Debt History, Tax Assessment Data, Financial Projections, Other Information, a Certification, and the Assurances listed on the application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's most recent financial statement must accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each application for a Community Disaster Loan must also include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinance, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating budget. For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term ``operating budget'' to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operating budget increases. Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Revenue and assessment information. The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due. Tax revenues assessed but not collected, or other revenues which the local government chooses to forgive, stay, or otherwise not exercise the right to collect, are not a legitimate revenue loss for purposes of evaluating the loan application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Estimated disaster-related expense. Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated. These are discussed in Sec. 206.366(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal review. (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a community disaster loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental function as the result of the disaster.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a community disaster loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental function as the result of the disaster.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Resubmission of application. If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be resubmitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Community disaster loan. (1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Promissory note. (i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see Sec. 206.364(d)(2)(ii)).

The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.
