The State Director must send notification, in the form of a letter, to all packagers who attended the packaging orientation and training that the number of applications specified in the advertisement required under Sec. 1944.72 of this subpart have been received. Any packages submitted after this date will be paid for only if the grantee can demonstrate the package was prepared in good faith and prior to receipt of the above notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For Multi-Family Housing loans/grants, HAPG funds will be available for designated areas or colonias to the extent specified in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's advertisement.
