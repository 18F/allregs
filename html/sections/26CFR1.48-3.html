                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) Section 48(c) provides that ``used section 38  property'' means section 38 property acquired by purchase after December  31, 1961, which   is not ``new section 38 property.'' See Sec. Sec.  1.48-1 and 1.48-2,  respectively, for definitions of section 38 property and new section 38  property. In determining whether property is acquired by purchase, the  provisions of paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of Sec.  1.179-3 shall apply, except that  (i) ``1961'' shall be substituted for ``1957'', and (ii) the definition  of ``component member'' of a controlled group of corporations in  paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be substituted for the definition  of such term in paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.179-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property shall not qualify as used section 38 property if,  after its acquisition by the taxpayer, it is used by (a) a person who  used such property before such acquisition, or (b) a person who bears a  relationship described in section 179(d)(2) (A) or (B) to a person who  used such property before such acquisition. Thus, for example, if  property is used by a person and is later sold by him under a sale and  lease-back arrangement, such property in the hands of the purchaser- lessor is not used section 38 property because the property, after its  acquisition, is being used by the same person who used it before its  acquisition. Similarly, where a lessee has been leasing property and  subsequently purchases it (whether or not the lease contains an option  to purchase), such property is not used section 38 property with respect  to the purchaser because the property is being used by the same person  who used it before its acquisition. In addition, if property owned by a  lessor is sold subject to the lease, or is sold upon the termination of  the lease, the property will not qualify as used section 38 property  with respect to the purchaser if, after the purchase, the property is  used by a person who used the property as a lessee before the purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of applying subdivision (i) of this subparagraph,  property shall not be considered as used by a person before its  acquisition if such property was used only on a casual basis by such  person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether a person bears a relationship described  in section 179(d)(2) (A) or (B) to a person who used property before its  acquisition by the taxpayer, the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and  (ii) of Sec.  1.179-3 shall apply, except that the definition of  ``component member'' of a controlled group of corporations in paragraph  (d)(4) of this section shall be substituted for the definition of such  term in paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.179-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation P acquires properties 1 and 2 in 1960 and  uses them in its trade or business until 1962. In 1962, corporation P  sells such properties to corporation Y, which leases back property 1 to  corporation P and leases property 2 to corporation S, a wholly owned  subsidiary of corporation P. Property 1 is not used section 38 property  in the hands of corporation Y because, after its acquisition by  corporation Y, it is used by a person (corporation P) who used it prior  to such acquisition. Property 2 is not used section 38 property because,  after its acquisition by corporation Y, it is used by a person  (corporation S) who is related, within the meaning of section  179(d)(2)(B), to a person (corporation P) who used it before such  acquisition.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1962, corporation L leases property from corporation  M. In 1964, corporation L acquires the property that it previously had  been leasing. The property acquired by corporation L is not used section  38 property because such property is used after such acquisition by the  same person (corporation L) who used the property before its acquisition  (corporation L).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation X buys property in 1962 and leases such  property to corporation Y. Corporation X in 1965 sells the property to A  subject to the lease. The property acquired by A is not used section 38  property if such property continues to be used by corporation Y, because  corporation Y used the property before its acquisition by A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. A owns a bulldozer which he rents out to a number of  different users, including B. In 1962, B used the bulldozer from  February 16 to March 12 and again on October 15 and 16. B purchases the  bulldozer from A on December 1, 1962. The prior use of the property by B  does not disqualify such property as used section 38 property to B,  because he used such property only on a casual basis prior to its  purchase.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cost. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The cost of used section 38 property is equal to the  basis of such property, but does not include so much of such basis as is  determined by reference to the adjusted basis of other property (whether  or not section 38 property) held at any time by the taxpayer acquiring  such used section 38 property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If property (whether or not section 38 property) is disposed of  by the taxpayer (other than by reason of its destruction or damage by  fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or its theft) and used  section 38 property similar or related in service or use is acquired as  a replacement therefor in a transaction in which the basis of the  replacement property is not determined by reference to the adjusted  basis of the property replaced, then the cost of the used section 38  property so acquired shall be its basis reduced by the adjusted basis of  the property replaced. The preceding sentence shall apply only if the  taxpayer acquires (or enters into a contract to acquire) the replacement  property within a period of 60 days before or after the date of the  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, the  cost of used section 38 property shall not be reduced with respect to  the adjusted basis of any property disposed of if, by reason of section  47, such disposition resulted in an increase of tax or a reduction of  investment credit carrybacks or carryovers described in section 46(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1972, A acquires machine 2 (an item of used section 38  property which has a sales price of $5,600) by trading in machine 1 (an  item of section 38 property acquired in 1962), and by paying an  additional $4,000 cash. The adjusted basis of machine 1 is $1,600. Under  the provisions of sections 1012 and 1031(d), the basis of machine 2 is  $5,600 ($1,600 adjusted basis of machine 1 plus cash expended of  $4,000). The cost of machine 2 which may be taken into account in  computing qualified investment for 1972 is $4,000 (basis of $5,600 less  $1,600 adjusted basis of machine 1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that  machine 2 has a sales price of $6,000. The trade-in allowance on machine  1 is $2,000. The result is the same as in example 1, that is, the basis  of machine 2 is $5,600 ($1,600 plus $4,000); therefore, the cost of  machine 2 which may be taken into account in computing qualified  investment for 1972 is $4,000 (basis of $5,600 less $1,600 adjusted  basis of machine 1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On September 18, 1962, B sells truck 1, which he acquired  in 1961 and which has an adjusted basis in his hands of $1,200. On  October 15, 1962, he purchases for $2,000 truck 2 (an item of used  section 38 property) as a replacement therefor. The cost of truck 2  which may be taken into account in computing qualified investment is  $800 ($2,000 less $1,200).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In 1962, C acquires property 1, an item of new section 38  property with a basis of $12,000 and a useful life of eight years or  more. He is allowed a credit under section 38 of $840 (7 percent of  $12,000) with respect to such property. In 1968, C acquires property 2  (an item of used section 38 property) by trading in property 1 and by  paying an additional amount in cash. Section 47(a) applies to the  disposition of property 1 and C's tax liability for 1968 is increased by  $280. Since the application of section 47(a) results in an increase in  tax, for purposes of computing qualified investment the cost of property  2 is not reduced by any part of the adjusted basis of the property  traded in.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(B)</em> shall not exceed $50,000. If the total cost of  used section 38 property exceeds $50,000, there must be selected, in the  manner provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, the particular  items of used section 38 property the cost of which is to be taken into  account in computing qualified investment. The cost of used section 38  property that may be taken into account by a person in applying the  $50,000 limitation for any taxable year includes not only the cost of  used section 38 property placed in service by such person during such  taxable year, but also the cost of used section 38 property apportioned  to such person. For purposes of this section, the cost of used section  38 property apportioned to any person means the cost of such property  apportioned to him by a trust, estate, or electing small business  corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), and his share of the cost  of partnership used section 38 property, with respect to the taxable  year of such trust, estate, corporation or partnership ending with or  within such person's taxable year. Thus, if an individual places in  service during his taxable year used section 38 property with a cost of  $25,000, if the cost of used section 38 property apportioned to him by  an electing small business corporation for   such year is $30,000, and if his share for such year of the cost of used  section 38 property placed in service by a partnership is $20,000, he  may select from the used section 38 property with a total cost of  $75,000 the particular used section 38 property the cost of which he  wishes to take into account. No part of the excess of $25,000 ($75,000  cost minus $50,000 annual limitation) may be taken into account in any  other taxable year. For determining the amount of the cost to be  apportioned by an electing small business corporation, see paragraph  (a)(2) of Sec.  1.48-5; in the case of estates and trusts, see paragraph  (a)(2) of Sec.  1.48-6. See paragraph (e) of this section for  application of $50,000 limitation in the case of affiliated groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Married individuals filing separate returns. In the case of a  husband or wife who files a separate return, the aggregate cost of used  section 38 property which may be taken into account for the taxable year  to which such return relates cannot exceed $25,000. The preceding  sentence shall not apply, however, unless the taxpayer's spouse places  in service (or is apportioned the cost of) used section 38 property for  the taxable year of such spouse which ends with or within the taxpayer's  taxable year. Thus, if a husband and wife who file separate returns on a  calendar year basis both place in service used section 38 property  during the taxable year, the maximum cost of used section 38 property  which may be taken into account by each is $25,000. However, in such  case, if only one spouse places in service (or is apportioned the cost  of) used section 38 property during the taxable year, such spouse may  take into account a maximum of $50,000 for such year. The determination  of whether an individual is married shall be made under the principles  of section 143 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, the aggregate cost  of used section 38 property placed in service by the partnership (or  apportioned to the partnership) which may be taken into account by the  partners with respect to any taxable year of the partnership may not  exceed $50,000. If such aggregate cost exceeds $50,000, the partnership  must make a selection in the manner provided in subparagraph (4) of this  paragraph. The $50,000 limitation applies to each partner, as well as to  the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Selection of $50,000 cost. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the sum of (a) the cost of  used section 38 property placed in service during the taxable year by  any person, (b) such person's share of the cost of partnership used  section 38 property placed in service during the taxable year of a  partnership ending with or within such person's taxable year, and (c)  the cost of used section 38 property apportioned to such person for such  taxable year by an electing small business corporation, estate, or  trust, exceeds $50,000, such person must make a selection for such  taxable year in the manner provided in subdivision (ii) of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of computing qualified investment (or, in the case  of a partnership, electing small business corporation, estate, or trust,  for purposes of selecting used section 38 property the cost of which may  be taken into account by the partners, shareholders, or estate or trust  and its beneficiaries) any person to whom subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph applies must select a total cost of $50,000 from (a) the  cost of specific used section 38 property placed in service by such  person, (b) such person's share of the cost of specific used section 38  property placed in service by a partnership and (c) the cost of used  section 38 property apportioned to such person by an electing small  business corporation, estate, or trust. When a particular property is  selected, the entire cost (or entire share of cost of a particular  property in the case of partnership property) of such property must be  taken into account unless, as a result of the selection of such  particular property, the $50,000 limitation is exceeded. Likewise, in  the case of an apportionment from an electing small business  corporation, estate, or trust, when the cost in a particular useful life  category is selected, the entire cost in such category must be taken  into account unless, as a result of the selection of such cost, the  $50,000 limitation is exceeded. Thus, if a person places in service  during the taxable year three items of used section 38 property, each  with a   cost of $20,000, he must select the entire cost of two of the items and  only $10,000 of the cost of the third item; he may not select a portion  of the cost of each of the three items. The selection by any person  shall be made by taking the cost of used section 38 property into  account in computing qualified investment (or in selecting the used  section 38 property the cost of which may be taken into account by the  partners, etc.), and if such property was placed in service by such  person, he must maintain records which permit specific identification of  any item of used section 38 property selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. H, who operates a sole proprietorship, purchases and  places in service in 1963 used section 38 property with a cost of  $60,000. His spouse, W, is a shareholder in an electing small business  corporation which purchases and places in service during its fiscal year  ending June 30, 1963, used section 38 property with a cost of $50,000.  Both spouses file separate returns on a calendar year basis. W, as a 60  percent shareholder on the last day of the taxable year of the  corporation, is apportioned $30,000 (60 percent of $50,000) of the cost  of the used section 38 property placed in service by the corporation.  The cost of used section 38 property that may be taken into account by H  on his separate return is $25,000. The cost of used section 38 property  that may be taken into account by W on her separate return is $25,000.  On the other hand, if the corporation had made no investment in used  section 38 property, H could take $50,000 of the $60,000 cost into  account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Partners X, Y, and Z share the profits and losses of  partnership XYZ in the ratio of 50 percent, 30 percent, and 20 percent,  respectively. The partnership and each partner make returns on the basis  of the calendar year. Each partner also operates a sole proprietorship.  In 1963, the partnership and the partners purchase and place in service  the following used section 38 property:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Estimated</p><p class="depth0">useful</p><p class="depth0">Property                         life        Cost</p><p class="depth0"><em>(years)</em> ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Partnership XYZ Property No. 1..................................           9     $10,000 Property No. 2..................................           7      50,000 Property No. 3..................................           7      50,000 Property No. 4..................................           5      30,000</p><p class="depth0">Partner X Property No. 5..................................           6      30,000</p><p class="depth0">Partner Y Property No. 6..................................          10      60,000</p><p class="depth0">Partner Z Property No. 7..................................           4      36,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selection by partnership.

Partner Y selects $50,000 of the cost of property No. 6, and no part of  his share of the cost of partnership property.

Any  such estimate shall also be used in determining the total cost of used  section 38 property placed in service by all component members for their  taxable years including such December 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an estimate is used by any component member of a controlled  group pursuant to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, each member may  later file an original or amended return in which the apportionment of  the $50,000 amount is based upon the cost of used section 38 property  actually placed in service by all component members of the group during  their taxable year which include such December 31. Such amended  apportionment shall be made only if each component member of the group  whose limitation would be changed files an original or amended return  which reflects the amended apportionment based upon the cost of the used  section 38 property actually placed in service by component members of  the group. In such case, the new statement reflecting the amended  apportionment shall be attached to the amended return of the filing  member of the group, and a copy of such statement shall be retained by  each such member pursuant to the requirements of subparagraph (2) of  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions of controlled group of corporations and component  member of controlled group. For purposes of this section, the terms  ``controlled group of corporations'' and ``component member'' of a  controlled group of corporations shall have the same meaning assigned to  those terms in section 1563 (a) and (b), except that the phrase ``more  than 50 percent'' shall be substituted for the phrase ``at least 80  percent'' each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1). For purposes of  applying Sec.  1.1563-1(b)(2)(ii)(c), an electing small business  corporation shall be treated as an excluded member whether or not it is  subject to the tax imposed by section 1378.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Members of controlled group filing a consolidated return. For  the purpose of apportioning the $50,000 amount in the case of component  members of a controlled group which join in filing a consolidated  return, all such members shall be treated as though they were a single  component member of the controlled group. Thus, in determining the  limitation on the cost of used section 38 property which may be taken  into account by the group filing the consolidated return, the  apportionment provided in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall  be made by using the aggregate cost of such property placed in service  by all members of the group filing the consolidated return. If all  component members of the controlled group join in filing a consolidated  return, the group may select the items to be taken into account to the  extent of an aggregate cost of $50,000; if some component members of the  controlled group do not join in filing the consolidated return, then the  members of the group which join in filing the consolidated return may  select the items to be taken into account to the extent of the amount  apportioned to such members under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On December 31, 1970, corporations M, N, and O are  component members of the same controlled group. The taxable years of M,  N, and O end, respectively, on January 31, March 31, and April 30.  During the respective taxable years of each corporation which include  December 31, 1970, M places in service no used section 38 property, and  N and O place in service used section 38 property with respective costs  of $100,000 and $150,000. N is the ``filing member'' of the group since  N, among the members (N and O)   which are apportioned part of the $50,000 amount for their taxable years  which include such December 31, has the taxable year ending on the  earliest date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of used section 38 property taken into account by N  for its taxable year ending March 31, 1971, may not exceed $20,000, that  is, an amount which bears the same ratio to $50,000 as the cost of used  section 38 property placed in service by N for its taxable year  ($100,000) bears to the total cost of used section 38 property placed in  service by all component members of the controlled group (M, N, and O)  for their taxable years which include December 31, 1970 ($250,000).  Similarly, the cost of used section 38 property taken into account by O  for its taxable year ending April 30, 1971, may not exceed $30,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On December 31, 1971, corporations S and T are  component members of the same controlled group. The taxable years of  corporations S and T end, respectively, on January 31 and June 30. On  April 15, 1972, S files an income tax return for its taxable year ending  January 31, 1972, during which year it places in service used section 38  property costing $100,000. T estimates that it will place in service  used section 38 property costing $150,000 during its taxable year ending  June 30, 1972.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S, the ``filing member'' of the group, must file an  apportionment schedule under which it may take into account as the cost  of used section 38 property an amount not in excess of $20,000  ($100,000/$250,000x $50,000). If T actually places in service during its  taxable year used section 38 property costing more or less than  $150,000, its income tax return for its taxable year ending June 30,  1972, may reflect the amended apportionment of the $50,000 limitation  based upon the cost of used section 38 property actually placed in  service by the group, provided that S attaches a new apportionment  schedule to an amended return to reflect the amended apportionment. For  example, if T places in service used section 38 property costing  $200,000, the cost of used section 38 property taken into account by S  and T for their respective taxable years could not exceed $16,667  ($100,000/$300,000x$50,000) and $33,333 ($200,000/$300,000x$50,000),  respectively, under an amended apportionment.
