                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The Commerce Country Chart allows you to determine the  Commerce Control List (CCL) export and reexport license requirements for  most items listed on the CCL. Such license requirements are based on the  Reasons for Control listed in the Export Control Classification Number  (ECCN) that applies to the item. Some ECCNs, however, impose license  requirements either without reference to a reason for control code that  is listed on the Commerce Country Chart, or in addition to such a  reference. Those   ECCNs may state their license requirements in full in their ``Reasons  for Control'' sections or they may refer the reader to another provision  of the EAR for license requirement information. In addition, some ECCNs  do not impose license requirements, but refer the reader to the  regulations of another government agency that may impose license  requirements on the items described in that ECCN.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ECCNs 0A983, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1, or for  5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))), 5D980, 5E001.a  (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) and 5E980. A license is  required for all destinations for items controlled under these entries.  For items controlled by 0A983, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a  (for 5A001.f.1)) and 5E980, no license exceptions apply. For items  controlled by 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5E001.a (for  5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))) and 5D980, License Exception  GOV may apply if your item is consigned to and for the official use of  an agency of the U.S. Government (see Sec. 740.2(a)(3)). If your item  is controlled by 0A983, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1 or for  5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))), 5D980, 5E001.a  (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) or 5E980 you should  proceed directly to Part 748 of the EAR for license application  instructions and Sec. Sec. 742.11 or 742.13 of the EAR for information  on the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Countries. The first column of the Country Chart lists countries  in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinations that are not  listed in the Country Chart contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 738.  If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and such  destination is a territory, possession, dependency or department of a  country included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination  the same licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory,  possession, dependency or department. For example, if your destination  is the Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom,  refer to the United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing  requirements. In addition, if your destination is Liechtenstein, which  serves as one territory with Switzerland for purposes of the EAR, refer  to Switzerland on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Columns. Stretching out to the right are horizontal headers  identifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason for  Control header are diagonal column identifiers capping individual  columns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason for  Control and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The column identifiers  correspond to those listed in the ``Country Chart'' header within the  ``License Requirements'' section of each ECCN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cells. The symbol ``X'' is used to denote licensing requirements  on the Country Chart. If an ``X'' appears in a particular cell,  transactions subject to that particular Reason for Control/Destination  combination require a license. There is a direct correlation between the  number of ``X''s applicable to your transaction and the number of  licensing reviews your application will undergo.
