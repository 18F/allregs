Washington, D.C. 1997.\2\ A POU, or ``point-of-use'' technology is a treatment device installed at a single tap used for the purpose</p><p class="depth4">of reducing contaminants in drinking water at that one tap. POU devices are typically installed at the kitchen</p><p class="depth4">tap.

See other RO</p><p class="depth4">limitations described in the SWTR compliance technologies table.\d\ The combination of variable source water quality and the complexity of the water chemistry involved may make</p><p class="depth4">this technology too complex for small surface water systems.\e\ Removal efficiencies can vary depending on water quality.\f\ This technology may be very limited in application to small systems.
