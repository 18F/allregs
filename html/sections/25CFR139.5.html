                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Indian-owned lands passing to non-Indian ownership shall be assessed  for construction costs and the first assessment shall be due on December  31 of the year that the Indian title is extinguished. The construction  costs against this land will be established as provided by section 5 of  the act of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 680). The annual per acre  assessment rate will be determined by dividing the established  construction cost per acre into forty equal payments. ``B'' lands will  also be assessed for reservoir construction costs in the annual per-acre  rate as established in the Designation Report dated August 1962.  Assessments against this land will continue until the entire established  construction costs shall have been repaid to the U.S. Treasury.  Landowners may pay at any time the total of the then remaining  indebtedness. Under the act of March 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 210), the unpaid  charges stand as a lien against the lands until paid.</p>
