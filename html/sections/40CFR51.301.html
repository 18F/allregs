                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Adverse impact on visibility means, for purposes of section 307, visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation, or enjoyment of the visitor's visual experience of the Federal Class I area. This determination must be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of visibility impairments, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of visitor use of the Federal Class I area, and (2) the frequency and timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility. This term does not include effects on integral vistas.</p><p class="depth0">Agency means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0">BART-eligible source means an existing stationary facility as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) means an emission limitation based on the degree of reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction for each pollutant which is emitted by an existing stationary facility. The emission limitation must be established, on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the technology available, the costs of compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, any pollution control equipment in use or in existence at the source, the remaining useful life of the source, and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology.</p><p class="depth0">Building, structure, or facility means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control).

A deciview is a haze index derived from calculated light extinction, such that uniform changes in haziness correspond to uniform incremental changes in perception across the entire range of conditions, from pristine to highly impaired. The deciview haze index is calculated based on the following equation (for the purposes of calculating deciview, the atmospheric light extinction coefficient must be calculated from aerosol measurements):
Deciview haze index=10 lne (bext/10 Mm-1).</p><p class="depth0">bext=the atmospheric light extinction coefficient, expressed in inverse megameters (Mm-1).</p><p class="depth0">Existing stationary facility means any of the following stationary sources of air pollutants, including any reconstructed source, which was not in operation prior to August 7, 1962, and was in existence on August 7, 1977, and has the potential to emit 250 tons per year or more of any air pollutant. In determining potential to emit, fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, must be counted.</p><p class="depth0">Fossil-fuel fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input,</p><p class="depth0">Coal cleaning plants (thermal dryers),</p><p class="depth0">Kraft pulp mills,</p><p class="depth0">Portland cement plants,</p><p class="depth0">Primary zinc smelters,</p><p class="depth0">Iron and steel mill plants,</p><p class="depth0">Primary aluminum ore reduction plants,</p><p class="depth0">Primary copper smelters,</p><p class="depth0">Municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 250 tons of refuse per day,</p><p class="depth0">Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, and nitric acid plants,</p><p class="depth0">Petroleum refineries,</p><p class="depth0">Lime plants,</p><p class="depth0">Phosphate rock processing plants,</p><p class="depth0">Coke oven batteries,</p><p class="depth0">Sulfur recovery plants,</p><p class="depth0">Carbon black plants (furnace process),</p><p class="depth0">Primary lead smelters,</p><p class="depth0">Fuel conversion plants,</p><p class="depth0">Sintering plants,</p><p class="depth0">Secondary metal production facilities,</p><p class="depth0">Chemical process plants,</p><p class="depth0">Fossil-fuel boilers of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input,</p><p class="depth0">Petroleum storage and transfer facilities with a capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels,</p><p class="depth0">Taconite ore processing facilities,</p><p class="depth0">Glass fiber processing plants, and</p><p class="depth0">Charcoal production facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Class I area means any Federal land that is classified or reclassified Class I.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Land Manager means the Secretary of the department with authority over the Federal Class I area (or the Secretary's designee) or, with respect to Roosevelt-Campobello International Park, the Chairman of the Roosevelt-Campobello International Park Commission.</p><p class="depth0">Federally enforceable means all limitations and conditions which are enforceable by the Administrator under the Clean Air Act including those requirements developed pursuant to parts 60 and 61 of this title, requirements within any applicable State Implementation Plan, and any permit requirements established pursuant to Sec. 52.21 of this chapter or under regulations approved pursuant to part 51, 52, or 60 of this title.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed capital cost means the capital needed to provide all of the depreciable components.</p><p class="depth0">Fugitive Emissions means those emissions which could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening.</p><p class="depth0">Geographic enhancement for the purpose of Sec. 51.308 means a method, procedure, or process to allow a broad regional strategy, such as an emissions trading program designed to achieve greater reasonable progress than BART for regional haze, to accommodate BART for reasonably attributable impairment.</p><p class="depth0">Implementation plan means, for the purposes of this part, any State Implementation Plan, Federal Implementation Plan, or Tribal Implementation Plan.</p><p class="depth0">Indian tribe or tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village, which is federally recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.</p><p class="depth0">In existence means that the owner or operator has obtained all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits required by Federal, State, or local air pollution emissions and air quality laws or regulations and either has (1) begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of physical on-site construction of the facility or (2) entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a
