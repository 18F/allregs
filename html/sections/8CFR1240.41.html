An immigration  judge may certify his or her decision in any case to the Board of  Immigration Appeals when it involves an unusually complex or novel  question of law or fact. Nothing contained in this part shall be  construed to diminish the authority conferred on immigration judges  under section 103 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal and substitution of immigration judges. The  immigration judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time  withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If an  immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties  within a reasonable time, or if at any time the respondent consents to a  substitution, another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the  case. The new immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself  with the record in the case and shall state for the record that he or  she has done so.
