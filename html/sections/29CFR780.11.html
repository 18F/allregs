                            <p class="depth0">Where an employee in the same workweek performs work which is exempt  under one section of the Act and also engages in work to which the Act  applies but is not exempt under some other section of the Act, he is not  exempt that week, and the wage and hour requirements of the Act are  applicable (see Mitchell v. Hunt, 263 F. 2d 913; Mitchell v. Maxfield,  12 WH Cases 792 (S.D. Ohio), 29 Labor Cases 69, 781; Jordan v. Stark  Bros. Nurseries, 45 F. Supp. 769; McComb v. Puerto Rico Tobacco  Marketing Co-op Ass'n, 80 F. Supp. 953, affirmed 181 F. 2d 697; Walling  v. Peacock Corp., 58 F. Supp. 880-883). On the other hand, an employee  who performs exempt activities during a workweek will not lose the  exemption by virtue of the fact that he performs other activities  outside the scope of the exemption if the other activities are not  covered by the Act.</p>
