MARAD will not approve access to the U.S. hull insurance market, if U.S. insurers are denied similar access to the hull insurance market in the applicant's home country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> MARAD will publish in the Federal Register each Notice of Application received from foreign underwriters described in Sec. 249.5(c), affording interested persons an opportunity to bring to MARAD's attention any discriminatory laws or practices relating to the placement of marine hull insurance which might exist in the applicant's country of domicile.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In granting approval, MARAD will consider all materials available to it, and may impose reasonable terms and conditions upon any such approvals granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon approval, applicant will be required to establish and maintain for the benefit of its U.S. policyholders a U.S. trust fund in the amount of at least $1.5 million, such amount to be

This requirement may be satisfied by means of an appropriate irrevocable letter of credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All policies, at the time of issuance, shall contain the latest American Institute of Marine Underwriters' forms, or equivalent, as approved by MARAD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All policies issued by foreign underwriters shall include New York Suable Clause or Service of Suit (USA) Clause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> To maintain approval, foreign underwriters, other than those specified in Sec. 249.5(b), shall, in addition to retaining the high rating from an accepted international rating service, file annual financial statements in the same level of detail as required for original approval. Such statements shall be due within 120 days after the close of the underwriter's annual accounting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To maintain approval, foreign underwriters, other than those specified in Sec. 249.5(b), shall, in addition to retaining the high rating from an accepted international rating service, file annual financial statements in the same level of detail as required for original approval.

Failure to provide such information on a timely basis could result in immediate withdrawal of the authorization to write hull insurance on MARAD program vessels.</p>
