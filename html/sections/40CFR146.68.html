                            <p class="depth0">Testing and monitoring requirements shall at a minimum include:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring of the injected wastes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator  shall develop and follow an approved written waste analysis plan that  describes the procedures to be carried out to obtain a detailed chemical  and physical analysis of a representative sample of the waste, including  the quality assurance procedures used. At a minimum, the plan shall  specify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The paramenters for which the waste will be analyzed and the  rationale for the selection of these parameters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The test methods that will be used to test for these  parameters; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sampling method that will be used to obtain a  representative sample of the waste to be analyzed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall repeat the analysis of the injected  wastes as described in the waste analysis plan at frequencies specified  in the waste analysis plan and when process or operating changes occur  that may significantly alter the characteristics of the waste stream.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall conduct continuous or periodic  monitoring of selected parameters as required by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator shall assure that the plan remains  accurate and the analyses remain representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hydrogeologic compatibility determination. The owner or operator  shall submit information demonstrating to the satisfaction of the  Director that the waste stream and its anticipated reaction products  will not alter the permeability, thickness or other relevant  characteristics of the confining or injection zones such that they would  no longer meet the requirements specified in Sec.  146.62.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compatibility of well materials. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall  demonstrate that the waste stream will be compatible with the well  materials with which the waste is expected to come into contact, and  submit to the Director a description of the methodology used to make  that determination. Compatibility for purposes of this requirement is  established if contact with injected fluids will not cause the well  materials to fail to satisfy any design requirement imposed under Sec.   146.65(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director shall require continuous corrosion monitoring of  the construction materials used in the well for wells injecting  corrosive waste, and may require such monitoring for other waste, by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Placing coupons of the well construction materials in contact  with the waste stream; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Routing the waste stream through a loop constructed with the  material used in the well; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Using an alternative method approved by the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a corrosion monitoring program is required:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The test shall use materials identical to those used in the  construction of the well, and such materials must be continuously  exposed to the operating pressures and temperatures (measured at the  well head) and flow rates of the injection operation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall monitor the materials for loss of  mass, thickness, cracking, pitting and other signs of corrosion on a  quarterly basis to ensure that the well components meet the minimum  standards for material strength and performance set forth in Sec.   146.65(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Periodic mechanical integrity testing. In fulfilling the  requirements of Sec.  146.8, the owner or operator of a Class I  hazardous waste injection well shall conduct the mechanical integrity  testing as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The long string casing, injection tube, and annular seal shall  be tested by means of an approved pressure test with a liquid or gas  annually and whenever there has been a well workover;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The bottom-hole cement shall be tested by means of an approved  radioactive tracer survey annually;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An approved temperature, noise, or other approved log shall be  run at least once every five years to test for movement of fluid along  the borehole. The Director may require such tests whenever the well is  worked over;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Casing inspection logs shall be run whenever the owner or  operator conducts a workover in which the injection string is pulled,  unless the Director waives this requirement due to well construction or  other factors which limit the test's reliability, or based upon the  satisfactory results of a casing inspection log run within the previous  five years. The Director may require that a casing inspection log be run  every five years, if he has reason to believe that the integrity of the  long string casing of the well may be adversely affected by naturally- occurring or man-made events;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other test approved by the Director in accordance with the  procedures in Sec.  146.8(d) may also be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ambient monitoring. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Based on a site-specific assessment of  the potential for fluid movement from the well or injection zone, and on  the potential value of monitoring wells to detect such movement, the  Director shall require the owner or operator to develop a monitoring  program. At a minimum, the Director shall require monitoring of the  pressure buildup in the injection zone annually, including at a minimum,  a shut down of the well for a time sufficient to conduct a valid  observation of the pressure fall-off curve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When prescribing a monitoring system the Director may also  require:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Continuous monitoring for pressure changes in the first aquifer  overlying the confining zone. When such a well is installed, the owner  or operator shall, on a quarterly basis, sample the aquifer and analyze  for constituents specified by the Director;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of indirect, geophysical techniques to determine the  position of the waste front, the water quality in a formation designated  by the Director, or to provide other site specific data;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Periodic monitoring of the ground water quality in the first  aquifer overlying the injection zone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Periodic monitoring of the ground water quality in the  lowermost USDW; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any additional monitoring necessary to determine whether fluids  are moving into or between USDWs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Director may require seismicity monitoring when he has  reason to believe that the injection activity may have the capacity to  cause seismic disturbances.
