                            <p class="depth0">Subsequent to the primary liquidation date, accounts which contain open commodity contracts not required to be liquidated under Sec. 190.02 (f)(1) shall be operated by the trustee as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operation of accounts held open for transfer--(1) Establishment of transfer accounts. On the primary liquidation date, the trustee must generate a new statement of account for each class of account of a customer which contains a commodity contract not required to be liquidated under Sec. 190.02(f)(1). The opening balance of such statement must be equal to its funded balance, less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to the net equity claim for such account prior to the primary liquidation date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establishment of transfer accounts. On the primary liquidation date, the trustee must generate a new statement of account for each class of account of a customer which contains a commodity contract not required to be liquidated under Sec. 190.02(f)(1). The opening balance of such statement must be equal to its funded balance, less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to the net equity claim for such account prior to the primary liquidation date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accounting for transfer accounts. The opening balance of any statement generated on the primary liquidation date in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be adjusted for operations on or subsequent to the primary liquidation date in the same manner as the equity in a commodity contract account maintained for or on behalf of a customer would adjusted in the ordinary course of business prior to the filing date: Provided, however, That such statement of account must also be adjusted to reflect certain adjustments to the funded balance in accordance with Sec. 190.07(c)(2), such that the balance in that account will always be equal to the funded balance of the claimant's net equity claim adjusted for corrections and subsequent operations less the value on the date of transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to that claim prior to the primary liquidation date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Margin calls. The trustee must promptly issue margin calls with respect to any account referred to under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in which the balance does not equal or exceed 100% of the maintenance margin requirements of the applicable designated contact market or swap execution facility, if any, with respect to the open commodity contracts in such account, or if there are no such maintenance margin requirements, 100% of the clearing organization's initial margin requirements applicable to the open commodity contracts in such account, or if there are no such maintenance margin requirements or clearing organization initial margin requirements, then 50% of the customer initial margin applicable to the commodity contracts in such account: Provided, That no margin calls need be made to restore customer initial margin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Margin payments. The trustee may make variation or maintenance margin payments to the broker carrying any account referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section as appropriate if such payments do not exceed the balance of the statement of account generated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to which such contracts are credited. Any customer for which commodity contracts remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date will not be relieved of the obligation to make margin payments by reason of the bankruptcy of the commodity broker: Provided, That the full amount of any margin payment made by a customer subsequent to the primary liquidation date must be credited to the account referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for which it was made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Distribution. No distribution of equity may be made to or on behalf of customers by the trustee with respect

to an account established in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section and to Sec. 190.08(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Liquidation of open commodity contracts. Commodity contracts held open by the trustee in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be liquidated promptly and in an orderly manner, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any payment of margin would result in a deficit in the account in which they are held;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The customer for, or on whose behalf, the account is held fails to meet a margin call within a reasonable time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The trustee has received no customer instructions with respect to such contract by the sixth calendar day after entry of the order for relief;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The commodity contract has not been transferred in accordance with Sec. 190.08(d)(2) on or before the seventh calendar day after entry of the order for relief; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The commodity contract would otherwise remain open (e.g., because it cannot be settled in cash) beyond the last day of trading in such contract (if applicable) or the first day on which notice of delivery may be tendered with respect to such contract, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liquidation of specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts. All specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts which have not been liquidated prior to the primary liquidation date, and for which no customer instructions have been timely received must be liquidated, to the extent reasonably possible, no later than the sixth calendar day after final publication of the notice referred to in Sec. 190.02(b)(1). All other specifically identifiable property must be liquidated or returned, to the extent reasonably possible, no later than the seventh calendar day after final publication of such notice.
