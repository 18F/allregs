However, employees shall not by failure  to meet their just financial obligations reflect adversely on the  Government as their employer. Employees are expected to pay each just  financial obligation in a proper and timely manner. A ``just financial  obligation'' is one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment  by a court, or one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local  taxes. ``In a proper and timely manner'' is a manner which the  Department determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect  adversely on the part of an employee in meeting his or her financial  obligations, particularly those that relate to support of the employee's  family, to payment of Federal, State, or local taxes, or to payments to  tax-supported institutions such as a city or State hospital, or  educational institution. If for some reason an employee is unable to pay  these obligations promptly, he or she is expected to make satisfactory  arrangements for payment and abide by these arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disciplinary action may be considered when an employee has  handled his or her financial affairs in such a way that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Action on complaints received from creditors requires the use of  a considerable amount of official time, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It appears that financial difficulties are impairing the  employee's efficiency on the job, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Because of the employee's financial irresponsibility, the  attitude of the general public toward the Department may be adversely  affected; and the employee after counseling does not make arrangements  to meet his or her financial obligations.</p>
