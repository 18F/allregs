                            <p class="depth0">To make household substances that are subject to requirements for  special packaging readily available to elderly or handicapped persons  who are unable to use those substances in special packaging, section  4(a) of the act authorizes manufacturers and packers to package such  substances in noncomplying packaging of a single size provided that  complying packaging is also supplied and the noncomplying packages are  conspicuously labeled to indicate that they should not be used in  households where young children are present. The purpose of this Sec.  1700.5 is to implement section 4(a) of the act by prescribing  requirements for the labeling of noncomplying packages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Labeling statement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The statement ``This Package for  Households Without Young Children'' shall appear conspicuously, and in  accordance with all of the requirements of paragraph (a)   of this section, on the package of any household substance subject to  the special packaging requirements of this part 1700 that is supplied in  noncomplying packaging under section 4(a) of the act, unless the package  bears the substitute labeling statement in accordance with all of the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The statement required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall  appear on the principal display panel of the immediate container as well  as on the principal display panel of any outer container or wrapping  used in the retail display of the substance. If a package bears more  than one principal display panel, the required statement shall appear on  each principal display panel of the immediate container as well as on  each principal display panel of any outer container or wrapping used in  the retail display of the substance. The principal display panel is the  part of the labeling most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or  examined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The required labeling statement shall appear within the  borderline of a square or rectangle on the principal display panel in  conspicuous and easily legible capital letters, shall be in distinct  contrast, by typography, layout, color, or embossing, to other matter on  the package, and shall appear in lines generally parallel to the base on  which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The declaration shall be in letters in type size established in  relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package  and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by  complying with the following type-size specifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Not less than \1/16\ inch in height on packages the principal  display panel of which has an area of 7 square inches or less.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not less than \3/32\ inch in height on packages the principal  display panel of which has an area of more than 7 but not more than 15  square inches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not less than \1/8\ inch in height on packages the principal  display panel of which has an area of more than 15 but not more than 25  square inches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Not less than \3/16\ inch in height on packages the principal  display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100  square inches.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Not less than \1/4\ inch in height on packages the principal  display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size for the  required statement for all packages of substantially the same size, the  area of the principal display panel is the area of the side or surface  that bears the principal display panel, which shall be:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side  properly can be considered to be the principal display panel, the  product of the height times the width of that side.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40  percent of the product of the height of the container times the  circumference.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the case of any other shape of container, 40 percent of the  total surface of the container; however, if such container presents an  obvious principal display (such as the top of a triangular or circular  package), the area shall consist of the entire area of such obvious  principal display panel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the area of the principal display panel exclude  tops, bottoms, flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders  and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly  cylindrical containers, the labeling statement required by this section  to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40  percent of the circumference most likely to be displayed, presented,  shown, or examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Substitute labeling statement. If the area of the principal  display panel, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this  section, is too small to accommodate the statement required by paragraph  (a)(1) using the type size required by paragraph (a)(4), the substitute  statement ``Package Not Child-Resistant'' may be used. This substitute  statement must comply with all of the requirements for size, placement,  and conspicuousness prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section.  [40 FR 4650, Jan. 31, 1975]</p>
