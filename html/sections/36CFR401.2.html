This chapter does not address temporary monuments, plaques and  other elements that deployed American Armed Forces wish to erect at a  facility occupied by them outside the United States. Approval of any  such temporary monument, plaque or other element is a matter to be  determined by the concerned component of the Department of Defense  consistent with host nation law and any other constraints applicable to  the presence of American Armed Forces at the overseas location.</p>
