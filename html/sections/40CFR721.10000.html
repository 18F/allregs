Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.63 (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6)(i), (b), and (c). The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 10-25 meet the minimum requirements for Sec. 721.63(a)(4): Air-purifying, tight-fitting respirator (either half- or full-face) equipped with N100 (if aerosols absent), R100, or P100 filters; powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a loose-fitting hood or helmet and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; powered air-purifying respirator equipped with a tight-fitting facepiece (either half- or full-face) and HEPA filters; and supplied-air respirator operated in pressure demand or continuous flow mode and equipped with a hood or helmet or tight-fitting facepiece (either half- or full-face). As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer, importer, or processor may choose to follow the new chemical exposure limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 0.7 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Persons who wish to pursue NCELs as an alternative to the Sec. 721.63 respirator requirements may request to do so under 40 CFR 721.30. Persons whose Sec. 721.30 requests to use the NCELs approach are approved by EPA will receive NCELs provisions comparable to those contained in the corresponding section 5(e) consent order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program.
