                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Yes, this subpart subcategorizes small municipal waste  combustion units into two groups based on the aggregate capacity of the  municipal waste combustion plant as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class I Units. Class I units are small municipal waste  combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants  with an aggregate plant combustion capacity greater than 250 tons per  day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of ``municipal waste  combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1465 for specification of which  units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Class II Units. Class II units are small municipal waste  combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants  with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250  tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of  ``municipal waste combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1465 for  specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate  capacity calculation.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirements for Class I and Class II units are identical  except for two items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Class I units have a nitrogen oxides emission limit. Class II  units do not have a nitrogen oxides emission limit (see table 1 of this  subpart). Additionally, Class I units have continuous emission  monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for nitrogen  oxides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Class II units are eligible for the reduced testing option  provided in Sec. 60.1305.</p><p class="depth3">Preconstruction Requirements: Materials Separation Plan</p>
