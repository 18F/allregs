they arrive at the next feeding station or destination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the movement of livestock is delayed en route so that the period of their confinement in the cars materially exceeds that specified by the Twenty-Eight Hour Law, the livestock should receive additional feed in proportion to such excess time.</p>
