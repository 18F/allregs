                            <p class="depth0">The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) directs that a five point Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) be prepared, circulated among interested Federal, State and local agencies, and filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before a major Federal action is taken which affects the quality of the human environment. This may include some disposals. No major disposal action will be undertaken where the Corps of Engineers is the disposal agency, or is acting for the disposal agency, until the required EIS has be submitted to the EPA unless a ``Finding of No Significant Impact'' (FONSI) has been prepared for the action, or if the action is classified as a ``categorically excluded'' item because it has no significant effect on the environment. The Environmental Assessment is subject to review and approval in accordance with instructions found in AR 200-1 and AR 200-2 (to be printed) for military real property disposal, and the forthcoming Engineer Regulation for civil works real property disposal. Where property is reported to GSA for disposal, GSA is responsible for compliance with NEPA.</p>
