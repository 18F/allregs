The late charge shall not exceed the  lesser of five percent of each installment of principal and interest, up  to a maximum of $10 per installment for any property improvement loan  and $15 per installment for any manufactured home loan, or the maximum  amount permitted by applicable State law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Method of payment. Payment of any late charge cannot be deducted  from the monthly payment for principal and interest, but must be an  additional charge to the borrower.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Daily interest in lieu of late charges. In lieu of late charges,  the note may provide for interest to accrue on installments in arrears  on a daily basis at the interest rate in the note.  [54 FR 36264, Aug. 31, 1989]</p>
