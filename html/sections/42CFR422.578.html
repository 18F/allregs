A physician who is providing treatment to an enrollee may, upon providing notice to the enrollee, request a standard reconsideration of a pre-service request for reconsideration on the enrollee's behalf as described in Sec. 422.582. An enrollee or physician (acting on behalf of an enrollee) may request an expedited reconsideration as described in Sec. 422.584.
