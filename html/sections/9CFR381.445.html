                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in Sec. 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under Sec. 381.500. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 381.409. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in Sec. 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under Sec. 381.500. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 381.409. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nutrition information on single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in Sec. 381.401 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in Sec. 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, may be provided at their point-of-purchase in accordance with the provisions of this section or on their label, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 381.409.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A retailer may provide nutrition information at the point-of-purchase by various methods, such as by posting a sign or by making the information readily available in brochures, notebooks, or leaflet form in close proximity to the food. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media. If a nutrition claim is made on point-of-purchase materials, all of the format and content requirements of Sec. 381.409 apply. However, if only nutrition information--and not a nutrition claim--is supplied on point-of-purchase materials, the requirements of Sec. 381.409 apply, provided, however:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The listing of percent of Daily Value for the nutrients (except vitamins and minerals specified in Sec. 381.409(c)(8)) and footnote required by Sec. 381.409(d)(9) may be omitted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The point-of-purchase materials are not subject to any of the format requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the point-of-purchase materials, the declaration of nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as specified in Sec. 381.409(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The nutrition label data for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be based on either raw or cooked edible portions of poultry cuts with skin. If data are based on cooked portions, the methods used to cook the products must be specified and for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be those which do not add nutrients from other ingredients such as flour, breading, and salt. Additional nutritional data may be presented on an optional basis for the raw or cooked edible portions of the skinless poultry meat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Nutrient data that are the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, may be used for nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen. These data may be composite data that reflect different classes of turkey or other variables affecting nutrient content. Alternatively, data that reflect specific classes or other variables may be used, except that if data are used on labels attached to a product which is labeled as to class of poultry or other variables, the data must represent the product in the package when such data are contained in the representative

data base. When data are used on labels attached to a product, the data must represent the edible poultry tissues present in the package.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the nutrition information is provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a nutrition label or labeling will not be subject to the Agency compliance review under Sec. 381.409(h), unless a nutrition claim is made on the basis of the representative data base values.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Retailers may use data bases that they believe reflect the nutrient content of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen; however, such labeling shall be subject to the compliance procedures of paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements specified in this subpart for the mandatory nutrition labeling program.
