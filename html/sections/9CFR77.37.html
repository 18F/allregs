                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Qualifications. To be recognized as a monitored herd:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification records must be maintained by the person, firm, or corporation responsible for the management of the herd for as long as status as a monitored herd is desired. Such records must be maintained on all captive cervids in the herd that are slaughtered, inspected, and found negative for tuberculosis at an approved slaughtering establishment or necropsied at an approved diagnostic laboratory. Identification records may also include captive cervids from the herd that tested negative for tuberculosis in accordance with requirements for interstate movement. No less than one-half of the captive cervids on which records are kept must be slaughter inspected; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A sufficient number of captive cervids in the herd must be slaughter inspected or tested for interstate movement to ensure that tuberculosis infection at a prevalence level of 2 percent or more will be detected with a confidence level of 95 percent. \2\ A maximum number of 178 captive cervids must be slaughter inspected or tested for interstate movement over a 3-year period to meet this requirement.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ A chart showing the number of captive cervids that must be slaughter inspected or tested for interstate movement, depending on the size of a herd, to meet this requirement may be obtained from the National Animal Health Programs staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 43, Riverdale, MD 20737-1231.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Movement allowed. Except as provided in Sec. 77.23 with regard to captive cervids that originate in an accredited-free State or zone, and except as provided in Sec. 77.31 with regard to captive cervids that originate in a nonaccredited State or zone, a captive cervid from a monitored herd may be moved interstate only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The captive cervid is not known to be infected with or exposed to tuberculosis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The captive cervid is officially identified and is accompanied by an ICVI, as provided in Sec. 77.32(c), that includes a statement that the captive cervid is from a monitored herd. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the ICVI must also state that the captive cervid has tested negative to an official tuberculosis test conducted within 90 days prior to the date of movement. If a group of captive cervids from a monitored herd is being moved interstate together to the same destination, all captive cervids in the group may be moved under one ICVI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Captive cervids under 1 year of age that are natural additions to the monitored herd or that were born in and originate from a classified herd may move without testing, provided that they are officially identified and that the ICVI accompanying them states that the captive cervids are natural additions to the monitored herd or

were born in and originated from a classified herd and have not been exposed to captive cervids from an unclassified herd.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Herd additions allowed. No captive cervid may be added to a monitored herd except in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) and either paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(3) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The captive cervid to be added must be moved directly from an accredited herd;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The captive cervid to be added must be moved directly from a qualified or monitored herd and must have tested negative to an official tuberculosis test conducted within 90 days prior to movement to the premises of the monitored herd; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the captive cervid to be added is not being moved directly from a classified herd, the captive cervid must be isolated from all other animals and must test negative to two official tuberculosis tests. The isolation must begin at the time of the first official tuberculosis test. The tests must be conducted at least 90 days apart, and the second test must be conducted within 90 days prior to movement to the premises of the monitored herd. The captive cervid must then be kept in isolation from all animals until it tests negative to an official tuberculosis test conducted at least 90 days following the date it arrives at the premises of the monitored herd. If a group of captive cervids is being moved together, the entire group must be isolated from all other animals during the testing period, but captive cervids in the group need not be isolated from each other during that period. Such herd additions will not receive status as members of the monitored herd for purposes of interstate movement until they have tested negative to an official tuberculosis test and been released from isolation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A captive cervid to be added must not have been exposed during the 90 days prior to its movement to either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A captive cervid from a herd with a lower classification status than its own; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any tuberculous livestock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance of monitored herd status. The person, firm, or corporation responsible for the management of the herd must submit an annual report to cooperating State or Federal animal health officials prior to the anniversary date of classification. This report must give the number of captive cervids currently in the herd; the number of captive cervids from the herd 1 year of age and older identified, slaughtered, and inspected at an approved slaughtering establishment or necropsied at an approved diagnostic laboratory during the preceding year; and the number of captive cervids that have tested negative for tuberculosis in accordance with interstate movement requirements. The number of slaughter inspections or negative testing captive cervids reported in any given year must be at least 25 percent of the total number required over a 3-year period to qualify a herd for monitored herd status. During each consecutive 3-year period, 100 percent of the qualifying total must be reported.
