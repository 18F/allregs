                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Any person specified in paragraph (c) of this section  who is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal institution in  excess of 60 days for conviction of a felony will not be paid  compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) in excess of  the amount specified in paragraph (d) of this section beginning on the  61st day of incarceration. VA will inform a person whose benefits are  subject to this reduction of the rights of the person's dependents to an  apportionment while the person is incarcerated, and the conditions under  which payments to the person may be resumed upon release from  incarceration. In addition, VA will also notify the person's dependents  of their right to an apportionment if the VA is aware of their existence  and can obtain their addresses. However, no apportionment will be made  if the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive felon as defined in  paragraph (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section the term  compensation includes disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. 1151. The  term dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) includes death  compensation payable under 38 U.S.C. 1121 or 1141, death compensation  and DIC payable under 38 U.S.C. 1151, and any benefit payable under  chapter 13 of title 38, United States Code. The term release from  incarceration includes participation in a work release or halfway house  program, parole, and completion of sentence. For purposes of this  section, a felony is any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for  a term exceeding 1 year, unless specifically categorized as a  misdemeanor under the law of the prosecuting jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section  are applicable to the following persons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A person serving a period of incarceration for conviction of a  felony committed after October 7, 1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person serving a period of incarceration after September 30,  1980 (regardless of when the felony was committed) when the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The person was incarcerated on October 1, 1980; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An award of compensation or DIC is approved after September 30,  1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A veteran who, on October 7, 1980, was incarcerated in a  Federal, State, or local penal institution for a felony committed before  that date, and who remains so incarcerated for a conviction of that  felony as of December 27, 2001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount payable during incarceration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Veteran rated 20  percent or more. A veteran to whom the provisions of paragraphs (a) and  (c) of this section apply with a service-connected disability evaluation  of 20 percent or more shall receive the rate of compensation payable  under 38 U.S.C. 1114(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Veteran rated less than 20 percent. A veteran to whom the  provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section apply with a  service-connected disability evaluation of less than 20 percent (even  though the rate for 38 U.S.C. 1114 (k) or (q) is paid) shall receive  one-half the rate of compensation payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surviving spouse, parent or child. A surviving spouse, parent,  or child, beneficiary to whom the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c)  of this section apply shall receive one-half the rate of compensation  payable under 38 U.S.C. 1114(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Apportionment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compensation. All or part of the compensation  not paid to an incarcerated veteran may be apportioned to the veteran's  spouse, child or children and dependent parents on the basis of  individual need. In determining individual need consideration shall be  given to such factors as the apportionee claimant's income and living  expenses, the amount of compensation available to be apportioned, the  needs and living expenses of other apportionee claimants as well as any  special needs, if any, of all apportionee claimants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DIC. All or part of the DIC not paid to an incarcerated  surviving spouse or other children not in the surviving spouse's custody  may be apportioned to another child or children. All or part of the DIC  not paid to an incarcerated child may be apportioned to the surviving  spouse or other children. These apportionments shall be made on the  basis of individual need giving consideration to the factors set forth  in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective dates. An apportionment under this section shall be  effective the date of reduction of payments made to the incarcerated  person, subject to payments to the incarcerated person over the same  period, if a claim or intent to file a claim as set forth in Sec.   3.155(b) is received within 1 year after notice to the incarcerated  person as required by paragraph (a) of this section, and any necessary  evidence is received within 1 year from the date of request by the  Department of Veterans Affairs; otherwise, payments may not be made for  any period prior to the date of receipt of a new claim or intent to file  a claim as set forth in Sec.  3.155(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Incarcerated dependent. No apportionment may be made to or on  behalf of any person who is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local  penal institution for conviction of a felony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notice to dependent for whom apportionment granted. A dependent  for whom an apportionment is granted under this section shall be  informed that the apportionment is subject to immediate discontinuance  upon the incarcerated person's release or participation in a work  release or halfway house program. A dependent shall also be informed  that if the dependent and the incarcerated person do not live together  when the incarcerated person is released (or participates in a work  release or halfway house program) the dependent may submit a new claim  for apportionment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Resumption upon release--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No apportionment or family  reunited. If there was no apportionment at the time of release from  incarceration, or if the released person is reunited with all dependents  for whom an apportionment was granted, the released person's   award shall be resumed the date of release from incarceration if the  Department of Veterans Affairs receives notice of release within 1 year  following release; otherwise the award shall be resumed the date of  receipt of notice of release. If there was an apportionment award during  incarceration, it shall be discontinued date of last payment to the  apportionee upon receipt of notice of release of the incarcerated  person. Payment to the released person shall then be resumed at the full  rate from date of last payment to the apportionee. Payment to the  released person from date of release to date of last payment to the  apportionee shall be made at the rate which is the difference between  the released person's full rate and the sum of (i) the rate that was  payable to the apportionee and (ii) the rate payable during  incarceration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apportionment granted and family not reunited. If there was an  apportionment granted during incarceration and the released person is  not reunited with all dependents for whom an apportionment was granted,  the released person's award shall be resumed as stated in paragraph  (i)(1) of this section except that when the released person's award is  resumed it shall not include any additional amount payable by reason of  a dependent(s) not reunited with the released person. The award to this  dependent(s) will then be reduced to the additional amount payable for  the dependent(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Apportionment to a dependent parent. An apportionment made to a  dependent parent under this section cannot be continued beyond the  veteran's release from incarceration unless the veteran is incompetent  and the provisions of Sec.  3.452(c) (1) and (2) are for application.  When a competent veteran is released from incarceration an apportionment  made to a dependent parent shall be discontinued and the veteran's award  resumed as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Increased compensation during incarceration--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The  amount of any increased compensation awarded to an incarcerated veteran  that results from other than a statutory rate increase may be subject to  reduction due to incarceration. This applies to a veteran whose  compensation is subject to reduction under paragraphs (a) and (c) of  this section prior to approval of an award of increased compensation as  well as to veteran whose compensation is not subject to reduction under  paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section prior to approval of an award of  increased compensation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Veteran subject to reduction under paragraphs (a) and (c) of  this section. If prior to approval of an award of increased compensation  the veteran's compensation was reduced under the provisions of  paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the amount of the increase shall  be reduced as follows if the veteran remains incarcerated:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the veteran's schedular evaluation is increased from 10  percent to 20 percent or greater, the amount payable to the veteran  shall be increased from one-half the rate payable under 38 U.S.C.  1114(a) to the rate payable under section 1114(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the veteran's schedular evaluation was 20 percent or more,  none of the increased compensation shall be paid to the veteran while  the veteran remains incarcerated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Veteran's compensation not subject to reduction under paragraphs  (a) and (c) of this section prior to award of increased compensation. If  prior to the approval of an award of increased compensation the veteran  is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal institution for  conviction of a felony and the veteran's compensation was not reduced  under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, none of  the increased compensation shall be paid to the veteran for periods  after October 7, 1980, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The veteran remains incarcerated after October 7, 1980 in a  Federal, State, or local penal institution for conviction of a felony;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The award of increased compensation is approved after October  7, 1980. If the effective date of the increase is prior to October 8,  1980, the amount payable for periods prior to October 8, 1980, shall not  be reduced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Apportionments. The amount of any increased compensation reduced   under this paragraph may be apportioned as provided in paragraph (e) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Retroactive awards. Whenever compensation or DIC is awarded to  an incarcerated person any amounts due for periods prior to date of  reduction under this section shall be paid to the incarcerated person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> DIC parents. If two parents are both entitled to DIC and were  living together prior to the time of the DIC payable to one parent was  reduced due to incarceration, they shall be considered as two parents  not living together for the purpose of determining entitlement to DIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Conviction overturned on appeal. If a conviction is overturned  on appeal, any compensation or DIC withheld under this section as a  result of incarceration for such conviction (less the amount of any  apportionment) shall be restored to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Fugitive felons. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compensation is not payable on behalf of a  veteran for any period during which he or she is a fugitive felon.  Compensation or DIC is not payable on behalf of a dependent of a veteran  for any period during which the veteran or the dependent is a fugitive  felon.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, the term fugitive felon means a  person who is a fugitive by reason of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after  conviction, for an offense, or an attempt to commit an offense, which is  a felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed for  commission of a felony under Federal or State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of paragraph (n) of this section, the term felony  includes a high misdemeanor under the laws of a State which  characterizes as high misdemeanors offenses that would be felony  offenses under Federal law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of paragraph (n) of this section, the term  dependent means a spouse, surviving spouse, child, or dependent parent  of a veteran.
