                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An assured may cancel an Open Cargo Policy by delivering to the  underwriting agent, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the requested  date of cancellation, an application for cancellation executed by the  assured on Form MA-304, prescribed in Sec. 308.524, together with the  original policy. The policy shall be cancelled as of the effective date  requested in the application, which, unless otherwise agreed by the  Maritime Administrator in writing, shall not be a date earlier than  fifteen (15) days following the date of the receipt of the application  as acknowledged by the underwriting agent on Form MA-304, with respect  to all risks that have not attached prior to said effective date. Such  cancellation shall not relieve the assured of the obligation to file  closing reports with respect to all risks which attached prior to the  effective date of the cancellation and to pay all unpaid premiums.  Within four (4) months of the effective date of cancellation, unless  otherwise agreed by the Maritime Administrator in writing, the assured  must file a closing report in duplicate on Form MA-313, prescribed in  Sec. 308.533, of all shipments covered by the policy for which closing  reports have not been previously filed. The assured shall mark this  closing report ''Final Closing Report on Cancellation of Policy'', and  file a certificate on Form MA-313-B, prescribed in Sec. 308.535,  executed by the assured in duplicate. Thereafter, when all unpaid  premiums have been paid, the assured will become entitled to a refund of  the collateral deposit, or cancellation of the surety bond in accordance  with Sec. Sec. 308.509 and 308.510. If the assured has lost or mislaid  the original policy and is unable to produce it for cancellation, the  assured shall execute a letter of indemnity and such other documents as  may be required by the Maritime Administrator.</p>
