                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A certificate of approval will be accompanied by a photograph of  a design for an approval plate, bearing the emblem of the Mine Safety  and Health Administration, the name of the applicant, the name of the  unit, the approval number or space for the approval number (or numbers  if permissibility of electrical parts is involved), spaces for the type  and the serial numbers of the unit, conditions of approval, and  identifying numbers of the dust-collector parts. When deemed necessary  by MSHA, an appropriate statement shall be added, giving the precautions  to be observed in maintaining the unit in an approved condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An approval plate for a unit designed for use in a nongassy coal  mine shall state that any electrical parts are not certified for use in  a gassy coal mine. (See Sec. 33.38(c).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The applicant shall reproduce the design either as a separate  plate or by   stamping or molding it in some suitable place on each unit to which it  relates. The size, type, and method of attaching and location of an  approval plate are subject to the approval of MSHA. The method of  affixing the plate shall not impair the dust-collection or explosion- proof features of the unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The approval plate identifies the unit, to which it is attached,  as permissible, and is the applicant's guarantee that the unit complies  with the requirements of this part. Without an approval plate, no unit  has the status of ``permissible'' under the provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of the approval plate obligates the applicant to whom the  certificate of approval was granted to maintain the quality of each unit  bearing it and guarantees that it is manufactured and assembled  according to the drawings and specifications upon which a certificate of  approval was based. Use of the approval plate is not authorized except  on units that conform strictly with the drawings and specifications upon  which the certificate of approval was based.
