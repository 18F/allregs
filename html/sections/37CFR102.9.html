                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Business information obtained by USPTO from a submitter will be disclosed under FOIA only under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Business information means commercial or financial information, obtained by USPTO from a submitter, which may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submitter means any person or entity outside the Federal Government from whom USPTO obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Designation of business information. A submitter of business information should designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the

submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice to submitters. The FOIA Officer shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its business information whenever required under paragraph (e) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity under paragraph (f) of this section to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information. Such written notice shall be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means. The notice shall either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records containing the information. When notification of a large number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When notice is required. Notice shall be given to the submitter whenever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FOIA Officer has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunity to object to disclosure. The FOIA Officer shall allow a submitter seven working days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the written notice described in paragraph (d) of this section to provide the FOIA Officer with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of FOIA and, in the case of exemption 4, it must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information a submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notice of intent to disclose. The FOIA Officer shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds under FOIA for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. If the FOIA Officer decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, the FOIA Officer shall give the submitter written notice via certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means, which shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of reason(s) why the submitter's objections to disclosure were not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement that the FOIA Officer intends to disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be disclosed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with Executive Order 12600; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous, in which case the FOIA Officer shall provide the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the FOIA Officer shall promptly notify the submitter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Corresponding notice to requesters. Whenever a FOIA Officer provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, the FOIA Officer shall also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files

a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester(s).</p>
