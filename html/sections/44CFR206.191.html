                                Sec. 206.191  Duplication of benefits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section establishes the policies for implementing  section 312 of the Stafford Act, entitled Duplication of Benefits. This  section relates to assistance for individuals and families.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Government policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal agencies providing disaster  assistance under the Act or under their own authorities triggered by the  Act, shall cooperate to prevent and rectify duplication of benefits,  according to the general policy guidance of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency. The agencies shall establish appropriate agency  policies and procedures to prevent duplication of benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Major disaster and emergency assistance provided to individuals  and families under the Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided  by States, local governments, and disaster assistance organizations, is  not considered as income or a resource when determining eligibility for  or benefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource- tested programs. Examples of federally funded income assistance or  resource-tested programs are the food   stamp program and welfare assistance programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FEMA policy. It is FEMA policy:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To prevent duplication of benefits between its own programs and  insurance benefits, and between its own programs and other disaster  assistance. Assistance under the Act may be provided in instances where  the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be  entitled by the time of application and if the applicant agrees to repay  all duplicated assistance to the agency providing the Federal  assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To examine a debt resulting from duplication to determine that  the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the  Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions to  remedy duplication which has occurred when other assistance has become  available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To assure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits, by  consulting with other Federal agencies and by performing selected  quality control reviews, that the other disaster relief agencies  establish and follow policies and procedures to prevent and remedy  duplication among their programs, other programs, and insurance  benefits; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To coordinate the effort of agencies providing assistance so  that each agency understands the prevention and remedial policies of the  others and is able to fulfill its own responsibilities regarding  duplication of benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guidance to prevent duplication of benefits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Delivery  sequence. FEMA provides the following policy and procedural guidance to  ensure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duplication occurs when an agency has provided assistance which  was the primary responsibility of another agency, and the agency with  primary responsibility later provides assistance. A delivery sequence  establishes the order in which disaster relief agencies and  organizations provide assistance. The specific sequence, in accordance  with the mandates of the assistance programs, is to be generally  followed in the delivery of assistance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the delivery sequence has been disrupted, the disrupting  agency is responsible for rectifying the duplication. The delivery  sequence pertains to that period of time in the recovery phase when most  of the traditional disaster assistance programs are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The delivery sequence is, in order of delivery:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Volunteer agencies' emergency assistance (except expendable  items such as clothes, linens, and basic kitchenware); insurance  (including flood insurance);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Housing assistance pursuant to section 408 of the Stafford Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Small Business Administration and Farmers Home Administration  disaster loans;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other Needs assistance, pursuant to section 408 of the Stafford  Act or its predecessor program, the Individual and Family Grant Program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Volunteer agencies' ``additional assistance'' programs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The ``Cora Brown Fund.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Two significant points about the delivery sequence are that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each assistance agency should, in turn, offer and be responsible  for delivering assistance without regard to duplication with a program  later in the sequence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sequence itself determines what types of assistance can  duplicate other assistance (i.e., a Federal program can duplicate  insurance benefits, however, insurance benefits cannot duplicate the  Federal assistance). An agency's position in the sequence determines the  order in which it should provide assistance and what other resources it  must consider before it does so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If following the delivery sequence concept would adversely  affect the timely receipt of essential assistance by a disaster victim,  an agency may offer assistance which is the primary responsibility of  another agency. There also may be cases when an agency (Agency B)  delivers assistance which is normally the primary responsibility of  another agency (Agency A) because Agency A has, for good cause, denied  assistance. After the assistance is delivered, Agency A reopens the  case. If the primary response Agency A then provides assistance, that  Agency A is responsible for coordinating with Agency B to either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assist Agency B in preventing the duplication of benefits, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case where the disaster victim has refused assistance  from Agency A, notify Agency B that it must recover assistance  previously provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Program guidance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Programs under the Act vs. other agency  assistance. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In making an eligibility determination, the FEMA  Regional Administrator, in the case of federally operated programs, or  the State, in the case of State operated programs, shall determine  whether assistance is the primary responsibility of another agency to  provide, according to the delivery sequence; and determine whether that  primary response agency can provide assistance in a timely way.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If it is determined that timely assistance can be provided by  the agency with primary responsibility, refrain from providing  assistance under the Act. If it is determined that assistance from the  agency with primary responsibility will be delayed, assistance under the  Act may be provided, but then must be recovered from the applicant when  the other assistance becomes available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Programs under the Act vs. insurance. In making an eligibility  determination, the FEMA Regional Administrator or State shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remind the applicant about his/her responsibility to pursue an  adequate settlement. The applicant must provide information concerning  insurance recoveries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine whether the applicant's insurance settlement will be  sufficient to cover the loss or need without disaster assistance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Determine whether insurance benefits (including flood  insurance) will be provided in a timely way. Where flood insurance is  involved, the Regional Administrator shall coordinate with the Federal  Insurance Administration. The purpose of this coordination is to obtain  information about flood insurance coverage and settlements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Random sample. Each disaster assistance agency is responsible  for preventing and rectifying duplication of benefits under the  coordination of the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) and the general  authority of section 312. To determine whether duplication has occurred  and established procedures have been followed, the Regional  Administrator shall, within 90 days after the close of the disaster  assistance programs application period, for selected disaster  declarations, examine on a random sample basis, FEMA's and other  government and voluntary agencies' case files and document the findings  in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved. If  duplication is discovered, the Regional Administrator shall determine  whether the duplicating agency followed its own remedial procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was  successful in correcting the duplication, the Regional Administrator  will take no further action. If the agency was not successful in  correcting the duplication, and the Regional Administrator is satisfied  that the duplicating agency followed its remedial procedures, no further  action will be taken.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of  benefits procedures, or the Regional Administrator is not satisfied that  the procedures were followed in an acceptable manner, then the Regional  Administrator shall provide an opportunity for the agency to take the  required corrective action. If the agency cannot fulfill its  responsibilities for remedial action, the Regional Administrator shall  notify the recipient of the excess assistance, and after examining the  debt, if it is determined that the likelihood of collecting the debt and  the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the  necessary recovery actions, then take those recovery actions in  conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case in the  random sample (or larger universe, at the Regional Administrator's  discretion).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Duplication when assistance under other authorities is involved.  When the random sample shows evidence that duplication has occurred and  corrective action is required, the Regional Administrator and the FCO  shall urge the duplicating agency to follow its own procedures to take  corrective action, and shall work with the agency toward that end. Under  his/her authority in section   312, the Regional Administrator shall require the duplicating agency to  report to him/her on its attempt to correct the duplications identified  in the sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recovering FEMA funds: debt collection. Funds due to FEMA are  recovered in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security's Debt  Collection Regulations (6 CFR part 11--Claims).  [54 FR 11615, Mar. 21, 1989, as amended at 67 FR 61460, Sept. 30, 2002;  74 FR 15350, Apr. 3, 2009]    Sec. Sec. 206.192-206.199  [Reserved]</p>
