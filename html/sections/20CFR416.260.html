                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in Secs. 416.260 through 416.269 describe the rules  for determining eligibility for special SSI cash benefits and for  special SSI eligibility status for an individual who works despite a  disabling impairment. Under these rules an individual who works despite  a disabling impairment may qualify for special SSI cash benefits and in  most cases for Medicaid benefits when his or her gross earned income  exceeds the applicable dollar amount which ordinarily represents SGA  described in Sec. 416.974(b)(2). The calculation of this gross earned  income amount, however, is not to be considered an actual SGA  determination. Also, for purposes of determining eligibility or  continuing eligibility for Medicaid benefits, a blind or disabled  individual (no longer eligible for regular SSI benefits or for special  SSI cash benefits) who, except for earnings, would otherwise be eligible  for SSI cash benefits may be eligible for a special SSI eligibility  status under which he or she is considered to be a blind or disabled  individual receiving SSI benefits. We explain the rules for eligibility  for special SSI cash benefits in Secs. 416.261 and 416.262. We explain  the rules for the special SSI eligibility status in Secs. 416.264  through 416.269.
