                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lubricating oil. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use the engine lubricating oil which meets  the marine engine manufacturer's requirements for a particular engine  and intended usage. Record the specifications of the lubricating oil  used for the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For two-stroke engines, the fuel/oil mixture ratio must be that  which is recommended by the manufacturer. If the flow rate of the oil in  the engine is greater than two percent of the fuel flow rate, then the  oil supplied to the engine must be added to the fuel flow in the  emission calculations described in Sec. 91.419 and Sec. 91.426. Good  engineering judgment may be used to estimate oil flow when oil injection  is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Test fuels--certification. The manufacturer must use gasoline  having the specifications or substantially equivalent specifications  approved by the Administrator, as specified in Table 3 in appendix A of  this subpart for exhaust emission testing of gasoline fueled engines.  The specification range of the fuel to be used under this paragraph must  be reported in accordance with Sec. 91.109(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test fuels--service accumulation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unleaded gasoline  representative of commercial gasoline which will be generally available  through retail outlets must be used in service accumulation for  gasoline-fueled marine engines. As an alternative, the certification  test fuels specified under paragraph (b) of this section for engine  service accumulation. Leaded fuel may not be used during service  accumulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The octane rating of the gasoline used may not be higher than  4.0 research octane numbers above the minimum recommended by the  manufacturer and have a minimum sensitivity of 7.5 octane numbers, where  sensitivity is defined as research octane number minus motor octane  number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other fuels may be used for testing provided:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are commercially viable,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided to  show that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use of a fuel listed under paragraph (b) of this section would  have a detrimental effect on emissions or durability; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Administrator provides written approval of the fuel  specifications prior to the start of testing.</p>
