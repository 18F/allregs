                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No permit shall be required under this part for any person  conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases,  licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively  for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological  resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the  disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation  conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed  to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception  does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to  comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources  prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use;  any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for  compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with  the permit requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No permit shall be required under this part for any person  collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which  is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that  such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaelogical  resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3  of the Act   of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or removal by any  Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological resource located on  Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in the absence of tribal  law regulating the excavation or removal or archaeological resources on  Indian lands, an individual tribal member shall be required to obtain a  permit under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No permit shall be required under this part for any person to  carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued  under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the  enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such  permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions  until expiration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June  8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit  is issued under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal  land manager's direction, associated with the management of  archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application  procedures of Sec. 1312.6. However, the Federal land manager shall  insure that provisions of Sec. Sec. 1312.8 and 1312.9 have been met by  other documented means, and that any official duties which might result  in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural  site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject  of consideration under Sec. 1312.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf  of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager  shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec.  1312.5(b)(5), 1312.7, 1312.8(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 1312.9,  1312.10, 1312.12, and 1312.13(a) to such Governor or to such designee as  the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for  purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or  removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any  materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other  scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land  manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities  governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may  be required for activities which do not require a permit under this  part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any  activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this  part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of  determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning  such activities.</p>
