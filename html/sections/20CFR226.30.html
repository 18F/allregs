                                Sec. 226.30  Spouse or divorced spouse tier I.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The tier I of a spouse or divorced spouse annuity is an  amount similar to the social security benefit the spouse or divorced  spouse would receive based on the employee's combined railroad and  social security earnings. In the case of an employee who retires before  age 62 with 30 years of service, the spouse tier I is simply 50% of the  employee tier I until the first month throughout which both the employee  and spouse are age 62 at which time the tier I is an amount similar to  the social security benefit on the employee's combined railroad and  social security earnings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reduction for other disability benefits. The spouse or divorced  spouse tier I may be adjusted for other disability benefits received by  a disabled employee, as shown in Sec. Sec. 226.70-226.74 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduction for government pension. The amount in paragraphs (a)  or (b) of this section is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of  any government pension payable on the spouse's or divorced spouse's  earnings record, as described in Sec. 226.31 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rounding. The last tier I rate from paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of  this section, if not a multiple of $1, is rounded to the next lower  multiple of $1. However, in cases in which the spouse is in receipt of  an age reduced 60/30 annuity or in which the employee with 30 years of  service began a disability annuity July 1, 1984, or later, the spouse  tier I is not rounded until all reductions have been made. See Sec.  226.10(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Age reduction. If the spouse or divorced spouse is entitled to a  reduced age annuity (see Sec. Sec. 216.51 and 216.52 of this chapter),  the rounded tier I rate from paragraph (d) of this section is multiplied  by a fraction for each month the spouse or divorced spouse is under  retirement age on the date the annuity begins. The result is subtracted  from the rate from paragraph (d) of this section. At present the  fraction is \25/36\ of 1% (or 1/144). In the case of an employee with 30  years of service who is awarded a disability annuity on July 1, 1984, or  later, where the spouse does not have a child of the employee under age  18 in care, the spouse tier I is reduced for each month the spouse is  under retirement age on the date the spouse annuity begins. If the  spouse is age 60 or 61, he or she is deemed to be age 62 for purposes of  the age reduction. The age reduction is applied before reduction for a  government pension.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reduction for social security benefit. The previous tier I rate,  from paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, is reduced by the amount of  any monthly benefit payable to the spouse or divorced spouse under title  II of the Social Security Act. The social security benefit used to  reduce tier I may be an age or disability benefit on the spouse's   or divorced spouse's own earnings record, a benefit based on the  earnings record of another person, or the total of two types of  benefits. The result cannot be less than zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reduction for employee annuity. If the spouse or divorced spouse  is entitled to an employee annuity on his or her own wage record, the  spouse or divorced spouse tier I is reduced for the spouse's own  employee annuity as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Spouse. If either the employee or the spouse had some railroad  service before 1975, the previous tier I rate from paragraphs (d)  through (f) of this section, whichever applies, is reduced (but not  below zero) by the spouse's own employee tier I rate, as computed under  Sec. 226.10 of this part. If both the employee and spouse began  railroad service after 1974, the spouse's total annuity rate, as shown  in Sec. 226.33, is reduced (but not below zero) by the spouse's own  employee total annuity rate, as shown in Sec. 226.14. These reductions  are effective from the later of the date the employee or spouse annuity  begins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Divorced spouse. The previous tier I rate from paragraphs (d)  through (f) of this section, whichever applies, is reduced (but not  below zero) by the divorced spouse's own employee total annuity rate as  shown in Sec. 226.14.</p><p class="depth3">Example: The computation of the spouse tier I may be illustrated as  follows: A railroad employee's wife who was born on September 16, 1920,  becomes entitled to a spouse annuity on October 1, 1982. She is also  entitled to a social security benefit of $190 a month effective October  1, 1982. Her husband's employee tier I PIA is $712.60. The spouse tier I  is $356.30 (50 percent of $712.60). This is rounded down to $356. Since  she is 35 months under age 65, the present retirement age when the  annuity begins, $356 is multiplied by 35/144, to produce an age  reduction of $86.53 and a tier I rate after age reduction of $269.47.  Her final tier I rate effective October 1, 1982, after reduction for  social security benefits, is $79.47 ($269.47 -$190.00).</p>
