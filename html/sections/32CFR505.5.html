                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Individual access. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The access provisions of this part are  intended for use by individuals whose records are maintained in a  Privacy Act system of   records. If a representative acts on their behalf, a written  authorization must be provided, with the exception of members of  Congress acting on behalf of a constituent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A Department of the Army ``Blanket Routine Use'' allows the  release of Privacy Act protected information to members of Congress when  they are acting on behalf of the constituent and the information is  filed and retrieved by the constituent's name or personal identifier.  The said ``Blanket Routine Use'' is listed below.</p><p class="depth3">``Congressional Inquiries Disclosure Routine Use: Disclosure from a  system of records maintained by a DOD Component may be made to a  congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an  inquiry from the congressional office made at the request of that  individual.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon a written request, an individual will be granted access to  information pertaining to him or her that is maintained in a Privacy Act  system of records, unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information is subject to an exemption, the system manager  has invoked the exemption, and the exemption is published in the Federal  Register; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The information was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a  civil action or proceeding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Legal guardians or parents acting on behalf of a minor child  have the minor child's rights of access under this part, unless the  records were created or maintained pursuant to circumstances where the  interests of the minor child were adverse to the interests of the legal  guardian or parent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> These provisions should allow for the maximum release of  information consistent with Army and DOD's statutory responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual requests for access. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individuals will address  requests for access to records in a Privacy Act system of records to the  system manager or the custodian of the record designated in DA systems  of records notices (See DA PAM 25-51 or the Defense Privacy Office's Web  site http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals do not have to state a reason or justify the need to  gain access to records under the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Release of personal information to individuals under this  section is not considered a ``public release'' of information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification of identity for first party requesters. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before  granting access to personal data, an individual will provide reasonable  verification of identity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When requesting records in writing, the preferred method of  verifying identity is the submission of a notarized signature. An  alternative method of verifying identity for individuals who do not have  access to notary services is the submission of an un-sworn declaration  in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746 in the following format:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If executed within the United States, its territories,  possessions, or commonwealths: ``I declare (or certify, verify, or  state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  Executed on (date). (Signature)''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If executed outside of the United States: ``I declare under  perjury or penalty under the laws of the United States of America that  the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an individual seeks access in person, identification can be  verified by documents normally carried by the individual (such as  identification card, driver's license, or other license, permit or pass  normally used for identification purposes). However, level of proof of  identity is commensurate with the sensitivity of the records sought. For  example, more proof is required to access medical records than is  required to access parking records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Telephonic requests will not be honored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An individual cannot be denied access solely for refusal to  provide his or her Social Security Number (SSN) unless the SSN was  required for access by statute or regulation adopted prior to January 1,  1975.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If an individual wishes to have his or her records released  directly to a third party or to be accompanied by a third party when  seeking access to his or her records, reasonable proof of authorization  must be obtained. The individual may be required to furnish a   signed access authorization with a notarized signature or other proof of  authenticity (i.e. telephonic confirmation) before granting the third  party access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Individual access to medical records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual must be  given access to his or her medical and psychological records unless a  judgment is made that access to such records could have an adverse  effect on the mental or physical health of the individual. This  determination normally should be made in consultation with a medical  doctor. Additional guidance is provided in DOD 5400.11-R, Department of  Defense Privacy Program. In this instance, the individual will be asked  to provide the name of a personal health care provider, and the records  will be provided to that health care provider, along with an explanation  of why access without medical supervision could be harmful to the  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information that may be harmful to the record subject should not  be released to a designated individual unless the designee is qualified  to make psychiatric or medical determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DA activities may offer the services of a military physician,  other than the one who provided the treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Do not require the named health care provider to request the  records for the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The agency's decision to furnish the records to a medical  designee and not directly to the individual is not considered a denial  for reporting purposes under the Act and cannot be appealed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> However, no matter what the special procedures are, DA has a  statutory obligation to ensure that access is provided the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Regardless of age, all DA military personnel and all married  persons are considered adults. The parents of these individuals do not  have access to their medical records without written consent of the  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> DOD 6025.18-R, DOD Health Information Privacy Regulation, issued  pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA) of 1996, has placed additional procedural requirements on the  uses and disclosure of individually identifiable health information  beyond those found in the Privacy Act of 1974 and this part. In order to  be in compliance with HIPAA, the additional guidelines and procedures  will be reviewed before release of an individual's identifiable health  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Personal notes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Privacy Act does not apply to personal  notes of individuals used as memory aids. These documents are not  Privacy Act records and are not subject to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The five conditions for documents to be considered personal  notes are as follows--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maintained and discarded solely at the discretion of the author;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Created only for the author's personal convenience and the  notes are restricted to that of memory aids;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Not the result of official direction or encouragement, whether  oral or written;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Not shown to others for any reason; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Not filed in agency files.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any disclosure from personal notes, either intentional or  through carelessness, removes the information from the category of  memory aids and the personal notes then become subject to provisions of  the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Denial or limitation of individual's right to access. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Even  if the information is filed and retrieved by an individual's name or  personal identifier, his or her right to access may be denied if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The records were compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil  action or proceeding including any action where DA expects judicial or  administrative adjudicatory proceedings. The term ``civil action or  proceeding'' includes quasi-judicial, pre-trial judicial, and  administrative proceedings, as well as formal litigation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The information is about a third party and does not pertain to  the requester. A third party's SSN and home address will be withheld.  However, information about the relationship between the individual and  the third party would normally be disclosed as it pertains to the  individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The records are in a system of records that has been properly  exempted by the Secretary of the Army from the access provisions of this  part and the information is exempt from release   under a provision of the Freedom of Information Act (See appendix C of  this part for a list of applicable Privacy Act exemptions, exceptions,  and ``Blanket'' routine uses);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The records contain properly classified information that has  been exempted from the access provision of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The records are not described well enough to enable them to be  located with a reasonable amount of effort on the part of an employee  familiar with the file. Requesters should reasonably describe the  records they are requesting. They do not have to designate a Privacy Act  system of records notice identification number, but they should at least  identify a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for  ``all records about me,'' DA personnel should ask the requester for more  information to narrow the scope of his or her request; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Access is sought by an individual who fails or refuses to  comply with Privacy Act established procedural requirements, included  refusing to pay fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requesters will not use government equipment, supplies,  stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels for making  Privacy Act requests. System managers will process such requests but  inform requesters that using government resources to make Privacy Act  requests is not authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a request for information contained in a Privacy Act system  of records is denied in whole or in part, the Denial Authority or  designee shall inform the requester in writing and explain why the  request for access has been refused.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A request for access, notification, or amendment of a record  shall be acknowledged in writing within 10 working days of receipt by  the proper system manager or record custodian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Relationship between the Privacy Act and the Freedom of  Information Act. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not all requesters are knowledgeable of the  appropriate statutory authority to cite when requesting information. In  some instances, they may cite neither the PA nor the Freedom of  Information Act in their request. In some instances they may cite one  Act but not the other. The Freedom of Information Act and the PA works  together to ensure that requesters receive the greatest amount of  information possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not deny the individual access to his or her records simply  because he or she failed to cite the appropriate statute or regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the records are required to be released under the Freedom of  Information Act, the PA will never block disclosure to requester. If the  PA allows the DA activity to deny access to an individual, the Freedom  of Information Act must still be applied, and the information released  if required by the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unlike the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act applies  only to U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent  residence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requesters who seek records about themselves contained in a  Privacy Act system of records (1st party requesters) and who cite or  imply only the Privacy Act, will have their request processed under the  provisions of both the PA and the Freedom of Information Act. If the  information requested is not contained in a Privacy Act system of  records or is not about the requester, the individual's request will be  processed under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act only,  and the Freedom of Information Act processing requirements/time lines  will apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Third party information. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Third party information contained  in a Privacy Act system of records that does not pertain to the  requester, such as SSN, home addresses, and other purely personal  information that is not about the requester, will be processed under the  provisions of Freedom of Information Act only. Third party information  that is not about the requester is not subject to the Privacy Act's  first party access provision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information about the relationship between the first party  requester and a third party is normally disclosed as pertaining to the  first party requester. Consult your servicing Staff Judge Advocate if  there is a question about the release of third party information to a  first party requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If an individual requests information about them contained in a  Privacy Act system of records, the individual may be denied the  information only if the information is exempt under both the PA and the  Freedom of Information Act. Both PA and Freedom of Information Act  exemptions will be cited in the denial letter and appeals will be  processed in accordance with both Acts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Each time a first party requester cites or implies the PA,  perform this analysis:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is the request from a United States living citizen or an alien  lawfully admitted for permanent residence?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is the individual requesting an agency record?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Are the records within a PA system of records that are filed  and retrieved by an individual's name or other personal identifier? (If  the answer is ``yes'' to all of these questions, then the records should  be processed under the ``Privacy Act'') and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does the information requested pertain exclusively to the  requester?</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If yes, no further consideration of Freedom of Information Act  exemptions required. Release all information unless a PA exemption  authorizes withholding.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If no, process the information that is not about the requester  under the Freedom of Information Act and withhold only if a proper  Freedom of Information Act exemption applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Functional requests. If an individual asks for his or her  records and does not cite or reasonably imply either the Privacy Act or  the Freedom of Information Act, and another prescribing directive or  regulation authorizes the release, the records should be released under  that other directive or regulation and not the PA or the FOIA. Examples  of functional requests are military members asking to see their Official  Military Personnel Records or civilian employees asking to see their  Official Personnel Folder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Procedures for denying or limiting an individual's right to  access or amendment and the role of the Denial Authority. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The only  officials authorized to deny a request for records or a request to amend  records in a PA system of records pertaining to the requesting  individual, are the appropriate Denial Authorities, their designees, or  the Secretary of the Army who will be acting through the General  Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial Authorities are authorized to deny requests, either in  whole or in part, for notification, access and amendment of Privacy Act  records contained in their respective areas of responsibility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Denial Authority may delegate all or part of their authority  to a division chief under his supervision within the Agency in the grade  of 0-5/GS-14 or higher. All delegations must be in writing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Denial Authority will send the names, office names, and  telephones numbers of their delegates to the DA Freedom of Information  and Privacy Office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a Denial Authority delegate denies access or amendment, the  delegate must clearly state that he or she is acting on behalf of the  Denial Authority, who must be identified by name and position in the  written response to the requester. Denial Authority designation will not  delay processing privacy requests/actions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The official Denial Authorities are for records under their  authority (See appendix B of this part). The individuals designated as  Denial Authorities under this part are the same individuals designated  as Initial Denial Authorities under AR 25-55, the Department of the Army  Freedom of Information Act Program. However, delegation of Denial  Authority pursuant to this part does not automatically encompass  delegation of Initial Denial Authority under AR 25-55. Initial Denial  Authority must be expressly delegated pursuant to AR 25-55 for an  individual to take action on behalf of an Initial Denial Authority under  AR 25-55.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The custodian of the record will acknowledge requests for access  made under the provisions of the Privacy Act within 10 working days of  receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for information recommended for denial will be  forwarded to the appropriate Denial Authority, along with a copy of the  records and justification for withholding the record. At the same time,  notify the requester of the referral to the Denial   Authority for action. All documents or portions thereof determined to be  releasable to the requester will be released to the requester before  forwarding the case to the Denial Authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Within 30 working days, the Denial Authority will provide the  following notification to the requester in writing if the decision is to  deny the requester access to the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Included in the notification will be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Denying Official's name, position title, and business address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Date of the denial;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The specific reason for the denial, citing the appropriate  subsections of the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act, AR 25- 55, The Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program and  this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The individual's right to administratively appeal the denial  within 60 calendar days of the mailing date of the notice, through the  Denial Authority, to the Office of the General Counsel, Secretary of the  Army, 104 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-0104.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The appeal must be in writing and the requester should provide a  copy of the denial letter and a statement of their reasons for seeking  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For denials made by the DA when the record is maintained in a  Government-wide system of records, an individual's request for further  review must be addressed to each of the appropriate government Privacy  Act offices listed in the Privacy Act system of records notices. For a  current listing of Government-wide Privacy Act system of records notices  see the Defense Privacy Office's Web site http://www.defenselink.mil/ privacy or DA PAM 25-51.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> No records determinations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Since a no record response may be  considered an ``adverse'' determination, the Denial Authority must make  the final determination that no records exist. The originating agency  shall notify the requester that an initial determination has been made  that there are no responsive records, however the final determination  will be made by the Denial Authority. A no records certificate must  accompany a no records determination that is forwarded to the Denial  Authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Denial Authority must provide the requester with appeal  rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Referral of requests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request received by a DA activity  having no records responsive to a request shall be referred to another  DOD Component or DA activity, if the other Component or activity  confirms that they have the requested records, or verifies that they are  the proper custodian for that type of record. The requester will be  notified of the referral. In cases where the DA activity receiving the  request has reason to believe that the existence or nonexistence of the  record may in itself be classified, that activity will consult the  Component or activity having cognizance over the records in question  before referring the request. If the Component or activity that is  consulted determines that the existence or nonexistence of the records  is in itself classified, the requester shall be so notified by the DA  activity originally receiving the request that it can neither confirm  nor deny the existence of the record, and no referral shall take place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A DA activity shall refer a Privacy Act request for a classified  record that it holds to another DOD Component, DA activity, or agency  outside the Department of Defense, if the record originated in the other  DOD Component, DA activity, or outside agency, or if the classification  is derivative. The referring DA activity will provide the records and a  release recommendation with the referral action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any DA activity receiving a request that has been misaddressed  will refer the request to the proper address and advise the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within DA, referrals will be made directly to offices having  custody of the requested records (unless the Denial Authority is the  custodian of the requested records). If the office receiving the Privacy  Act request does not know where the requested records are located, the  office will contact the DA FOIA/P Office, to determine the appropriate  office for referral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The requester will be informed of the referral whenever records  or a portion of records are, after prior consultation, referred to  another activity for a release determination and direct   response. Additionally, the DA activity referral letter will accomplish  the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fully describe the Privacy Act system of records from which the  document was retrieved; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Indicate whether the referring activity claims any exemptions  in the Privacy Act system of records notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Within the DA, an activity will refer a Privacy Act request for  records that it holds but was originated by another activity, to the  originating activity for direct response. An activity will not, in any  case, release or deny such records without prior consultation with the  originating activity. The requester will be notified of such referral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A DA activity may refer a Privacy Act request for records that  originated in an agency outside of DOD, or that is based on information  obtained from an agency outside the DOD, to that agency for direct  response to the requester, only if that agency is subject to the Privacy  Act. Otherwise, the DA activity must respond to the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> DA activities will not honor any Privacy Act requests for  investigative, intelligence, or any other type of records that are on  loan to the Department of Defense for a specific purpose, if the records  are restricted from further release in writing. Such requests will be  referred to the agency that provided the records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A DA activity will notify requesters seeking National Security  Council (NSC) or White House documents that they should write directly  to the NSC or White House for such documents. DA documents in which the  NSC or White House have a concurrent reviewing interest will be  forwarded to the Department of Defense, Office of Freedom of Information  and Security Review, which will coordinate with the NSC or White House,  and return the documents to the originating DA activity after NSC or  White House review. NSC or White House documents discovered in DA  activity files which are responsive to a Privacy Act request will be  forwarded to DOD for coordination and return with a release  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> To the extent referrals are consistent with the policies  expressed above; referrals between offices of the same DA activity are  authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Reproduction fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use fees only to recoup direct  reproduction costs associated with granting access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DA activities may use discretion in their decision to charge for  the first copy of records provided to an individual to whom the records  pertain. Thereafter, fees will be computed pursuant to the fee schedule  set forth in AR 25-55, including the fee waiver provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Checks or money orders for fees should be made payable to the  Treasurer of the United States and will be deposited in the  miscellaneous receipts of the treasury account maintained at the  activity's finance office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reproduction costs shall only include the direct costs of  reproduction and shall not include costs of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Time or effort devoted to searching for or reviewing the records  by personnel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fees not associated with the actual cost of reproduction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Producing a copy when it must be provided to the individual  without cost under another regulation, directive, or law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Normal postage;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Transportation of records or personnel; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Producing a copy when the individual has requested only to  review the records and has not requested a copy, and the only means of  allowing review is to make a copy (e.g., the records are stored in a  computer and a copy must be printed to provide individual access, or the  activity does not wish to surrender temporarily the original records for  the individual to review).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Privacy Act case files. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever an individual submits a  Privacy Act request, a case file will be established. This Privacy Act  case file is a specific type of file that is governed by a specific  Privacy Act system of records notice. In no instance will the  individual's Privacy Act request and corresponding Army actions be  included in the individual's military personnel file or other military  filing systems, such as adverse action files or general legal files, and  in no instance will the Privacy Act case file be used   to make an adverse determination about the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The case file will be comprised of the request for access/ amendment, grants, refusals, coordination action(s), and all related  papers.</p>
