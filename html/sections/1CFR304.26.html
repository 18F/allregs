                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How made and addressed. Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this section), you may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by the agency to another person, organization, or agency of any record about you. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. Your request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made in writing to the agency, following the procedures in Sec. 304.21.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where accountings are not required. The agency is not required to provide accountings to you where they relate to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept (i.e., disclosures that are made to officers and employees of the agency and disclosures required under the FOIA); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from a duly authorized representative of any such law enforcement agency specifying portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Appeals. You may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see Sec. 304.24(a)) and the same procedures will be followed.</p>
