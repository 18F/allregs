                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enriched farina conforms to the definition and standard of  identity prescribed for farina by Sec. 137.300, except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It contains in each pound not less than 2.0 milligrams (mg) and  not more than 2.5 mg of thiamin, not less than 1.2 mg and not more than  1.5 mg of riboflavin, not less than 16.0 mg and not more than 20.0 mg of  niacin or niacinamide, not less than 0.7 mg and not more than 0.87 mg of  folic acid, and not less than 13.0 mg of iron (Fe).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vitamin D may be added in such quantity that each pound of the  finished enriched farina contains not less than 250 U.S.P. units of the  optional ingredient vitamin D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calcium may be added in such quantity that each pound of the  finished enriched farina contains not less than 500 milligrams of the  optional ingredient calcium (Ca).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It may contain not more than 8 percent by weight of the optional  ingredient wheat germ or partly defatted wheat germ.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It may contain not less than 0.5 percent and not more than 1  percent by weight of the optional ingredient disodium phosphate; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It may be treated with one of the proteinase enzymes papain or  pepsin to reduce substantially the time required for cooking. In such  treatment papain or pepsin, in an amount not to exceed 0.1 percent by  weight, is added to the farina, which is moistened, warmed, and  subsequently heated sufficiently to inactivate the enzyme and to dry the  product to comply with the limit for moisture prescribed by  Sec. 137.300(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In determining whether the ash content complies with the  requirements of this section allowance is made for ash resulting from  any added iron or salts of iron or calcium, or from any added disodium  phosphate, or from any added wheat germ or partly defatted wheat germ.   Iron and calcium may be added only in forms which are harmless and  assimilable. Dried irradiated yeast may be used as a source of vitamin  D. The substances referred to in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this  section may be added in a harmless carrier which does not impair the  enriched farina; such carrier is used only in the quantity necessary to  effect an intimate and uniform admixture of such substances with the  farina.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the optional ingredient disodium phosphate is used, the  label shall bear the statement ``Disodium phosphate added for quick  cooking''.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the proteinase enzyme treatment is used, the label shall  bear the statement ``Enzyme treated for quicker cooking''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so  conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of  purchase, the statements prescribed by paragraph (b)(2) of this section  shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name without  intervening written, printed, or graphic matter; except that where the  name of the food is a part of a trademark or brand, then other written,  printed, or graphic matter that is also a part of the trademark or brand  may so intervene, if such statement is in such juxtaposition with the  trademark or brand as to be conspicuously related to the name of the  food.
