                                Sec. 320.11  Request for waiver of recovery.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Time limitation. The claimant shall have 60 days from the date  of the notification of the erroneous payment determination in which to  file a request for waiver, except that where an erroneous payment is not  subject to waiver in accordance with Sec. 340.10(e) of this chapter,  waiver may not be requested and recovery will not be stayed. Such  requests shall be made in writing and be filed by mail or in person at  any Board office. The claimant shall, along with the request, submit any  evidence and argument which he or she would like to present in support  of his or her case. A request solely for reconsideration of an  overpayment shall not be considered a request for waiver under this  section but shall be treated as a request for reconsideration under  Sec. 320.10 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery action. Where a claimant has made a timely request for  waiver of recovery, no action will be taken to recover the erroneous  payment by setoff against current benefits prior to a decision on such  request; provided however, That the Board may, prior to a decision,  withhold the amount of the erroneous payment from benefit payments under  any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The claimant admits he or she was at fault in causing the  overpayment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The claimant is found to have committed fraud;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The claimant authorizes recovery by setoff or agrees to  repayment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amount of erroneous payment is not subject to waiver or  provided for in Sec. 340.10(e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of evidence. Upon request, the claimant shall have an  opportunity to review all evidence and documents that pertain to the  erroneous payment determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decision. The Debt Recovery Manager shall make a decision on the  claimant's request for waiver of recovery and shall notify the claimant  accordingly. The decision of the Manager shall include the basis of the  decision, setting forth his or her reasons for the decision including  the impact, if any, of any evidence submitted by the base-year or last  employer. If the Manager decides that waiver of recovery is not  appropriate, the adjudicating office shall wait 15 days from the date of  the notification of the waiver decision before taking any action to  recover the erroneous payment. If the Manager decides that recovery  should be waived, any amount of the erroneous payment so waived but  previously recovered by setoff shall be refunded to the claimant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Appeal. If the Debt Recovery Manager decides that waiver of  recovery is   not appropriate, the claimant shall have the right to appeal such  decision as provided under Sec. 320.12 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requests made after 60 days. Nothing in this section shall be  taken to mean that waiver of recovery will not be considered in those  cases where the request for waiver is not filed within 60 days, but  action to recover the erroneous payment will not be deferred if such  request is not filed within 60 days, and any amount of the erroneous  payment recovered prior to the date on which the request is filed shall  not be subject to waiver under part 340 of this chapter. Further, it  shall not be considered that a claimant prejudices his or her request  for waiver by tendering all or a portion of an erroneous payment or by  selecting a particular method of repaying the debt. However, no waiver  consideration shall be given to a debt which is settled by compromise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Evidence provided by base-year employer(s) and most recent  employer, if different. In making a decision under paragraph (d) of this  section, the Debt Recovery Manager shall consider all evidence of record  including any evidence submitted by the claimant's base-year employer(s)  and the most recent employer, if different. Where a claimant has  requested waiver the Manager shall notify his or her base-year  employer(s) and the most recent employer, if different, of the right to  submit, within 30 days, any information which may be pertinent to the  waiver decision.
