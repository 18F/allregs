When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for Sec. 721.63 (a)(4), engineering control measures (e.g., enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (e.g., workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. The following National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators with an Assigned

Protection Factor (APF) of at least 10 meet the requirements of Sec. 721.63(a)(4):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> NIOSH-certified power air-purifying respirator with a hood or helmet and with appropriate gas/vapor (acid gas, organic vapor, or substance specific) cartridges in combination with HEPA filters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> NIOSH-certified continuous flow supplied-air respirator equipped with a loose fitting face piece, hood, or helmet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> NIOSH-certified negative pressure (demand) supplied-air respirator with a full face piece.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As an alternative to the respiratory requirements listed here, a manufacturer or processor may choose to follow the New Chemical Exposure Limit (NCEL) provisions listed in the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance. The NCEL is 2.4 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour time weighted average verified by actual monitoring data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hazard communication program. Requirements as specified in Sec. 721.72.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If as a result of the test data required under the TSCA section 5(e) consent order for this substance, the employer becomes aware that this substance may present a risk of injury to human health or the environment, the employer must incorporate this new information, and any information on methods for protecting against such risk, into a MSDS as described in Sec. 721.72(c) within 90 days from the time the employer becomes aware of the new information. If this substance is not being manufactured, processed, or used in the employer's workplace, the employer must add the new information to a MSDS before the substance is reintroduced into the workplace.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The employer must ensure that persons who will receive the PMN substance from the employer, or who have received the PMN substance from the employer within 5 years from the date the employer becomes aware of the new information described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, are provided an MSDS containing the information required under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section within 90 days from the time the employer becomes aware of the new information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.
