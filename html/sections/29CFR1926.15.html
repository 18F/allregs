                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A contract for ``construction'' is one for nonpersonal service.  See, e.g., 41 CFR 1-1.208. Section 2(e) of the Service Contract Act of  1965 requires as a condition of every Federal contract (and bid  specification therefor) exceeding $2,500, the ``principal purpose'' of  which is to furnish services to the United States through the use of  ``service employees,'' that certain safety and health standards be met.  See 29 CFR part 1925, which contains the Department rules concerning  these standards. Section 7 of the Service Contract Act provides that the  Act shall not apply to ``any contract of the United States or District  of Columbia for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including  painting and decorating of public buildings or public works.'' It is  clear from the legislative history of section 107 that no gaps in  coverage between the two statutes are intended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Contract Work  Hours and Safety Standards Act provides, among other things, that the  Act shall not apply to any work required to be done in accordance with  the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.</p>
