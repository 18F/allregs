                            <p class="depth0">The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called ``EAJA'' in this subpart), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called ``adversary adjudications'') before the Department. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Department unless the position of the Department was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. Alternatively, an eligible party may receive an award in connection with an adversary adjudication arising from an agency action to enforce the party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement where the demand by the agency is substantially in excess of the decision of the adjudicative officer and is unreasonable when compared with such decision under the facts and circumstances of the case. The rules in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Department will use to make awards.</p>
