                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When certificate should be executed. A notarizing officer should  execute a certificate of acknowledgment immediately after the parties to  the instrument have made their acknowledgment. Allowing several days or  weeks to elapse between the time the acknowledgment is made and the  certificate executed is undesirable, even though the officer may  remember the acknowledgment act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Venue. The venue must be shown as prescribed in Sec. 92.14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date. The date in the certificate must be the date the  acknowledgment was made. This is not necessarily the same as the date  the instrument was executed. In fact, there is no reason why an  instrument may not be acknowledged a year or more after the date of its  execution, or at different times and places by various grantors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Names of parties. The name or names of the person or persons  making the acknowledgment should appear in the certificate in the same  form as they are set out in the acknowledged document, and in the same  form as their signature on the instrument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional statements. When executing a certificate of  acknowledgment on Form FS-88, the notarizing officer may include any  necessary additional statements in the blank space below the body of the  certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Signing and sealing certificate. The certificate of  acknowledgment shall be signed and sealed as prescribed in Sec. Sec.  92.15 and 92.16.  [22 FR 10858, Dec. 27, 1957, as amended at 60 FR 51723, Oct. 3, 1995]</p>
