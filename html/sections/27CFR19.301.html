                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The distillation of spirits must be done in a continuous system.  Distilling operations are continuous when the spirits are moved through  the various steps of production as quickly as plant operation will  permit. The proprietor may move the product through as many distilling  or other production operations as desired, provided the operations are  continuous. The collection of unfinished spirits for the purpose of  redistillation is not considered to be a break in the continuity of the  distilling procedure. However, the quantity and proof of any unfinished  spirits must be determined and recorded before any mingling with other  materials or before any further operations involving the unfinished  spirits outside the continuous system. Before the production gauge,  spirits may be held only as long as reasonably necessary to complete the  production procedure.  (26 U.S.C. 5178, 5211, 5222)</p>
