                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All transactions ordinarily incident to the exportation of items from the United States, or the reexportation of 100% U.S.-origin items from a third country, to any person within Cuba are authorized, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The exportation or reexportation is licensed or otherwise authorized by the Department of Commerce under the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2401-0420) (see the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR 730-774); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only the following payment and financing terms may be used:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Payment of cash in advance. For the purposes of this section, the term ``payment of cash in advance'' shall mean payment before the transfer of title to, and control of, the exported items to the Cuban purchaser; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Financing by a banking institution located in a third country provided the banking institution is not a designated national, a U.S. citizen, a U.S. permanent resident alien, or an entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including any foreign branch of such an entity). Such financing may be confirmed or advised by a U.S. banking institution.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth4">The transactions authorized by this paragraph include, but are not limited to, all transactions that are directly incident to the shipping of specific exports or reexports (e.g., insurance and transportation of the exports to Cuba). Transactions that are not tied to specific exports or reexports, such as transactions involving future (non-specific) shipments, must be separately licensed by OFAC. For the waiver of the prohibitions on entry into U.S. ports contained in Sec. 515.207 for vessels transporting shipments of items between the United States and Cuba pursuant to this section, see Sec. 515.550.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are authorized to engage in all transactions ordinarily incident to negotiation of and entry into executory contracts for the sale of items that may be exported from the United States to Cuba or 100% U.S.-origin items that may be reexported from a third country to Cuba consistent with the export licensing policy of the Department of Commerce, provided that performance of such executory contracts is expressly made contingent on the prior authorization by the Department of Commerce.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 515.533(b):</p><p class="depth2">This paragraph does not authorize transactions related to travel to, from, or within Cuba. See paragraph (d) for a general license addressing such transactions, and paragraph (e) with respect to specific licenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section does not authorize:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The financing of any transactions from any blocked account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any transaction involving, directly or indirectly, property in which any designated national, other than a person located in the country to which the exportation or reexportation is consigned, has an interest or has had an interest since the effective date set forth in Sec. 515.201 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> General license for travel-related transactions incident to sales of certain items. The travel-related transactions set forth in Sec. 515.560(c) and such additional transactions as are directly incident to the conduct of market research, commercial marketing, sales negotiation, accompanied delivery, or servicing in Cuba of items consistent with the export or reexport licensing policy of the Department of Commerce are authorized, provided that the traveler's schedule of activities does not include free time or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full-time schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Specific licenses. Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis authorizing the travel-related transactions set forth in Sec. 515.560(c) and such other transactions as are related to the exportation and reexportation of items to Cuba when such transactions do not

qualify for the general license under paragraph (d) of this section.
