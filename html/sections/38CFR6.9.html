                            <p class="depth0">If the insured has selected an optional settlement then at the death  of the insured the designated beneficiary may elect to receive the  proceeds of insurance in installments spread over a greater period of  time than that selected by the insured and in accordance with the  following provisions.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1952)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the insured has selected Option 1, the beneficiary may elect  to receive payment under Option 2, 3, or 4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the insured has selected Option 2 with monthly installments  not in excess of 120, the beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a  greater number of installments under Option 2, or may elect to receive  payment under Option 3 or 4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the insured has selected Option 2 with monthly installments  in excess of 120, the beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a  greater number of installments under Option 2, or may elect to receive  payment under Option 3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the insured has selected Option 3, and named no contingent  beneficiary, the beneficiary may elect to receive payment under Option  4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of  this section, be made by a beneficiary after payment has commenced,  provided the change is made within 1 year of the original election and  in those instances where Option 3 is changed to Option 1 or 2; or Option  4 is changed to Option 1, 2, or 3, satisfactory proof is submitted to  establish that the beneficiary's state of health is the same as it was  at time of original election. The effective date of the original  election for this purpose will be the date it was delivered to the  Department of Veterans Affairs. If such election was forwarded by mail,  properly addressed to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the postmark  date will be taken as the date of delivery. Such change will be made on  the premise that the new election was made initially, and the account  will be adjusted accordingly. A condition precedent to any such change  will be the repayment of any amount received by the beneficiary in  excess of that which would have been due had the new election been made  initially.
