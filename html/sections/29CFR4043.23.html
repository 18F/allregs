A reportable event occurs when the number of active participants under a plan is reduced to less than 80 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of the plan year, or to less than 75 percent of the number of active participants at the beginning of the previous plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Initial information required. In addition to the information in Sec. 4043.3(b), the notice shall include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement explaining the cause of the reduction (e.g., facility shutdown or sale); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number of active participants at the date the reportable event occurs, at the beginning of the plan year, and at the beginning of the prior plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waivers--(1) Small plan.

As of the testing date for the event year, the plan has less than $1 million in unfunded vested benefits; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No unfunded vested benefits. As of the testing date for the event year, the plan would have no unfunded vested benefits if unfunded vested benefits were determined in accordance with the assumptions and methodology in Sec. 4010.4(b)(2) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No facility closing event/80-percent funded. Notice is waived if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The active participant reduction would not be reportable if only those active participant reductions resulting from cessation of operations at one or more facilities were taken into account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As of the testing date for the event year, the fair market value of the plan's assets is at least 80 percent of the plan's vested benefits amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extensions. The notice date is extended to the latest of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Form 1 extension. 30 days after the plan's variable rate premium filing due date for the event year if a waiver

under any of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(3) of this section would apply if ``the plan year preceding the event year'' were substituted for ``the event year'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form 5500 extension. 30 days after the plan's Form 5500 due date that next follows the date the reportable event occurs, provided the event would not be reportable counting only those participant reductions resulting from cessation of operations at a single facility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Form 1-ES extension.

The number of active participants at the beginning of a plan year may be determined by using the number of active participants at the end of the previous plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Active participant. ``Active participant'' means a participant who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is receiving compensation for work performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is on paid or unpaid leave granted for a reason other than a layoff;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Is laid off from work for a period of time that has lasted less than 30 days; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Is absent from work due to a recurring reduction in employment that occurs at least annually.</p>
