                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The histopathological and biochemical techniques in  this guideline are designed to develop data in animals on morphologic  changes in the nervous system associated with repeated inhalation  exposures to motor vehicle emissions. These tests are not intended to  provide a detailed evaluation of neurotoxicity. Neuropathological  evaluation should be complemented by other neurotoxicity studies, e.g.  behavioral and neurophysiological studies and/or general toxicity  testing, to more completely assess the neurotoxic potential of an  exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition. Neurotoxicity (NTX) or a neurotoxic effect is an  adverse change in the structure or function of the nervous system  following exposure to a chemical substance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Principle of the test method. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Laboratory rodents are exposed  to one of several concentration levels of a test atmosphere for at least  six hours daily over a period of 90 days. At the end of the exposure  period, the animals are anaesthetized, perfused in situ with fixative,  and tissues in the nervous system are examined grossly and prepared for  microscopic examination. Starting with the highest dosage level, tissues  are examined under the light microscope for morphologic changes, until a  no-observed-adverse-effect level is determined. In cases where light  microscopy has revealed neuropathology, the NOAEL may be confirmed by  electron microscopy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tests described herein may be combined with any other  toxicity study, as long as none of the requirements of either are  violated by the combination. Specifically, this assay may be combined  with a subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to provisions in Sec. 79.62.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limit test. If a test at one dose level of the highest  concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle size  distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 4  micrometers ([micro]m) or less, using the   procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section, produces no  observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based  upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using  three dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure though  may indicate the need for a higher dose level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain.  Testing shall be performed in the species being used in other NTX tests.  A standard strain of laboratory rat is recommended. The choice of  species shall take into consideration such factors as the comparative  metabolism of the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects  of the test substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies, the  potential for combined studies, and the availability of other toxicity  data for the species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Age. Animals shall be at least ten weeks of age at the start of  exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sex. Both sexes shall be used unless it is demonstrated that  one sex is refractory to the effects of exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Number of Animals. A minimum of ten animals per group shall be  used. The tissues from each animal shall be examined separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control Groups. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A concurrent control group, exposed to  clean, filtered air only, is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The laboratory performing the testing shall provide positive  control data, e.g., results from repeated acrylamide exposure, as  evidence of the ability of their histology procedures to detect  neurotoxic endpoints. Positive control data shall be collected at the  time of the test study unless the laboratory can demonstrate the  adequacy of historical data for the planned study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A satellite group of 10 female and 10 male test subjects shall  be treated with the highest concentration level for the duration of the  exposure and observed thereafter for reversibility, persistence, or  delayed occurrence of toxic effects during a post-treatment period of  not less than 28 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inhalation exposure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All data developed within this study  shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  Sec. 79.60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with  the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline in Sec. 79.61.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Study conduct--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Observation of animals. All toxicological  (e.g., weight loss) and neurological signs (e.g., motor disturbance)  shall be recorded frequently enough to observe any abnormality, and not  less than weekly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following is a minimal list of measures that shall be  noted:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Body weight;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Subject's reactivity to general stimuli such as removal from the  cage or handling;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Description, incidence, and severity of any convulsions,  tremors, or abnormal motor movements in the home cage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Descriptions and incidence of posture and gait abnormalities  observed in the home cage; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Description and incidence of any unusual or abnormal behaviors,  excessive or repetitive actions (stereotypies), emaciation, dehydration,  hypotonia or hypertonia, altered fur appearance, red or crusty deposits  around the eyes, nose, or mouth, and any other observations that may  facilitate interpretation of the data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sacrifice of animals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General. The goal of the techniques  outlined for sacrifice of animals and preparation of tissues is  preservation of tissue morphology to simulate the living state of the  cell.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Perfusion technique. Animals shall be perfused in situ by a  generally recognized technique. For fixation suitable for light or  electronic microscopy, saline solution followed by buffered 2.5 percent  glutaraldehyde or buffered 4.0 percent paraformaldehyde, is recommended.  While some minor modifications or variations in procedures are used in  different laboratories, a detailed and standard procedure for vascular  perfusion may be found in the text by Zeman and Innes (1963), Hayat  (1970), and Spencer and Schaumburg (1980) under paragraph (g) of this  section. A more sophisticated technique is described by Palay and Chan- Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, the lungs  shall be instilled with fixative via the trachea during the fixation  process in order to   preserve the lungs and achieve whole-body fixation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Removal of brain and cord. After perfusion, the bony structure  (cranium and vertebral column) shall be exposed. Animals shall then be  stored in fixative-filled bags at 4 [deg]C for 8-12 hours. The cranium  and vertebral column shall be removed carefully by trained technicians  without physical damage of the brain and cord. Detailed dissection  procedures may be found in the text by Palay and Chan-Palay (1974) under  paragraph (g) of this section. After removal, simple measurement of the  size (length and width) and weight of the whole brain (cerebrum,  cerebellum, pons-medulla) shall be made. Any abnormal coloration or  discoloration of the brain and cord shall also be noted and recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sampling. Cross-sections of the following areas shall be  examined: The forebrain, the center of the cerebrum, the midbrain, the  cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata; the spinal cord at the cervical  swelling (C3-C6), and proximal sciatic nerve (mid- thigh and sciatic notch) or tibial nerve (at knee). Other sites and  tissue elements (e.g., gastrocnemius muscle) shall be examined if deemed  necessary. Any observable gross changes shall be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specimen storage. Tissue samples from both the central and  peripheral nervous system shall be further immersion fixed and stored in  appropriate fixative (e.g., 10 percent buffered formalin for light  microscopy; 2.5 percent buffered gluteraldehyde or 4.0 percent buffered  paraformaldehyde for electron microscopy) for future examination. The  volume of fixative versus the volume of tissues in a specimen jar shall  be no less than 25:1. All stored tissues shall be washed with buffer for  at least 2 hours prior to further tissue processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Histopathology examination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Fixation. Tissue specimens  stored in 10 percent buffered formalin may be used for this purpose. All  tissues must be immersion fixed in fixative for at least 48 hours prior  to further tissue processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dehydration. All tissue specimens shall be washed for at least 1  hour with water or buffer, prior to dehydration. (A longer washing time  is needed if the specimens have been stored in fixative for a prolonged  period of time.) Dehydration can be performed with increasing  concentration of graded ethanols up to absolute alcohol.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Clearing and embedding. After dehydration, tissue specimens  shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast.  Multiple tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, ganglia) may be embedded  together in one single block for sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be  labelled showing at least the experiment number, animal number, and  specimens embedded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sectioning. Tissue sections, 5 to 6 microns in thickness, shall  be prepared from the tissue blocks and mounted on standard glass slides.  It is recommended that several additional sections be made from each  block at this time for possible future needs for special stainings. All  tissue blocks and slides shall be filed and stored in properly labeled  files or boxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Histopathological techniques. The following general testing  sequence is proposed for gathering histopathological data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General staining. A general staining procedure shall be  performed on all tissue specimens in the highest treatment group.  Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E;) shall be used for this purpose. The staining  shall be differentiated properly to achieve bluish nuclei with pinkish  background.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Peripheral nerve teasing. Peripheral nerve fiber teasing shall  be used. Detailed staining methodology is available in standard  histotechnological manuals such as AFIP (1968), Ralis et al. (1973), and  Chang (1979) under paragraph (g) of this section. The nerve fiber  teasing technique is discussed in Spencer and Schaumberg (1980) under  paragraph (g) of this section. A section of normal tissue shall be  included in each staining to assure that adequate staining has occurred.  Any changes shall be noted and representative photographs shall be  taken. If a lesion(s) is observed, the special techniques shall be  repeated in the next lower treatment group until no further lesion is  detectable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Examination. All stained microscopic slides shall be examined  with a   standard research microscope. Examples of cellular alterations (e.g.,  neuronal vacuolation, degeneration, and necrosis) and tissue changes  (e.g., gliosis, leukocytic infiltration, and cystic formation) shall be  recorded and photographed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Data collection, reporting, and evaluation. In addition to  information meeting the requirements stated under 40 CFR 79.60 and  79.61, the following specific information shall be reported:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Description of test system and test methods. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description  of the general design of the experiment shall be provided. This shall  include a short justification explaining any decisions where  professional judgment is involved such as fixation technique and choice  of stains; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Positive control data from the laboratory performing the test  that demonstrate the sensitivity of the procedures being used.  Historical data may be used if all essential aspects of the experimental  protocol are the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Results. All observations shall be recorded and arranged by test  groups. This data may be presented in the following recommended format:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Description of signs and lesions for each animal. For each  animal, data must be submitted showing its identification (animal  number, treatment, dose, duration), neurologic signs, location(s) nature  of, frequency, and severity of lesion(s). A commonly-used scale such as  1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ for degree of severity ranging from very slight to  extensive may be used. Any diagnoses derived from neurologic signs and  lesions including naturally occurring diseases or conditions, shall also  be recorded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Counts and incidence of lesions, by test group. Data shall be  tabulated to show:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The number of animals used in each group, the number of animals  displaying specific neurologic signs, and the number of animals in which  any lesion was found; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The number of animals affected by each different type of lesion,  the average grade of each type of lesion, and the frequency of each  different type and/or location of lesion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evaluation of data. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An evaluation of the data based on  gross necropsy findings and microscopic pathology observations shall be  made and supplied. The evaluation shall include the relationship, if  any, between the animal's exposure to the test atmosphere and the  frequency and severity of any lesions observed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The evaluation of dose-response, if existent, for various groups  shall be given, and a description of statistical method must be  presented. The evaluation of neuropathology data shall include, where  applicable, an assessment in conjunction with any other neurotoxicity  studies, electrophysiological, behavioral, or neurochemical, which may  be relevant to this study.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> References.
