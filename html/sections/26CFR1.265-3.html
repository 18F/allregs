                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. No deduction is allowed to a shareholder of a regulated investment company for interest on indebtedness that relates to exempt-interest dividends distributed by the company to the shareholder during the shareholder's taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest relating to exempt-interest dividends. (1) All or a portion of the interest on an indebtedness relates to exempt-interest dividends if the indebtedness is either incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of stock of a regulated investment company that distributes exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5) of the Code) to the holder of the shares during the shareholder's taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All or a portion of the interest on an indebtedness relates to exempt-interest dividends if the indebtedness is either incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of stock of a regulated investment company that distributes exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5) of the Code) to the holder of the shares during the shareholder's taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To determine the amount of interest that relates to the exempt-interest dividends the total amount of interest paid or accrued on the indebtedness is multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of exempt-interest dividends received by the shareholder. The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the exempt-interest dividends and taxable dividends received by the shareholder (excluding capital gain dividends received by the shareholder and capital gains required to be included in the shareholder's computation of long-term capital gains under section 852(b)(3)(D)).
