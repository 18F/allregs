In  addition, if the delegated (permitting) authority is the State, the  owner or operator shall send a copy of each report submitted to the  State to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA, as specified in  paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Regional Office may waive this  requirement for any reports at its discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If an owner or operator of an affected source in a State with  delegated authority is required to submit periodic reports under this  part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the  submission of periodic reports that is consistent with the reporting  frequency(ies) specified for such source under this part, the owner or  operator may change the dates by which periodic reports under this part  shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be  consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the  owner or operator and the State. For each relevant standard established  pursuant to section 112 of the Act, the allowance in the previous  sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the affected  source's compliance date for that standard. Procedures governing the  implementation of this provision are specified in Sec. 63.9(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary  sources affected by more than one standard established pursuant to  section 112 of the Act, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between  the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State permitting  authority) a common schedule on which periodic reports required for each  source shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the  previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the  latest compliance date for any relevant standard established pursuant to  section 112 of the Act for any such affected source(s). Procedures  governing the implementation of this provision are specified in  Sec. 63.9(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary  sources affected by standards established pursuant to section 112 of the  Act (as amended November 15, 1990) and standards set under part 60, part  61, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual  agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the  State permitting authority) a common schedule on which periodic reports  required by each relevant (i.e., applicable) standard shall be submitted  throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in  each State beginning 1 year after the stationary source is required to  be in compliance with the relevant section 112 standard, or 1 year after  the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the  applicable part 60 or part 61 standard, whichever is latest.

Before a title V permit  has been issued to the owner or operator of an affected source, the  owner or operator shall report the results of any performance test under  Sec. 63.7 to the Administrator. After a title V permit has been issued  to the owner or operator of an affected source, the owner or operator  shall report the results of a required performance test to the  appropriate permitting authority. The owner or operator of an affected  source shall report the results of the performance test to the  Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) before the  close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the  performance test, unless specified otherwise in a relevant standard or  as approved otherwise in writing by the Administrator. The results of  the performance test shall be submitted as part of the notification of  compliance status required under Sec. 63.9(h).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reporting results of opacity or visible emission observations.  The owner or operator of an affected source required to conduct opacity  or visible emission observations by a relevant standard shall report the  opacity or visible emission results (produced using Test Method 9 or  Test Method 22, or an alternative to these test methods) along with the  results of the performance test required under Sec. 63.7. If no  performance test is required, or if visibility or other conditions  prevent the opacity or visible emission observations from being  conducted concurrently with the performance test required under  Sec. 63.7, the owner or operator shall report the opacity or visible  emission results before the close of business on the 30th day following  the completion of the opacity or visible emission observations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Progress reports. The owner or operator of an affected source  who is required to submit progress reports as a condition of receiving  an extension of compliance under Sec. 63.6(i) shall submit such reports  to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) by  the dates specified in the written extension of compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports. If  actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup or shutdown (and  the startup or shutdown causes the source to exceed any applicable  emission limitation in the   relevant emission standards), or malfunction of an affected source  (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with  the procedures specified in the source's startup, shutdown, and  malfunction plan (see Sec. 63.6(e)(3)), the owner or operator shall  state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report.  Actions taken to minimize emissions during such startups, shutdowns, and  malfunctions shall be summarized in the report and may be done in  checklist form; if actions taken are the same for each event, only one  checklist is necessary. Such a report shall also include the number,  duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which  occurred during the reporting period and which caused or may have caused  any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded. Reports shall only be  required if a startup or shutdown caused the source to exceed any  applicable emission limitation in the relevant emission standards, or if  a malfunction occurred during the reporting period. The startup,  shutdown, and malfunction report shall consist of a letter, containing  the name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other  responsible official who is certifying its accuracy, that shall be  submitted to the Administrator semiannually (or on a more frequent basis  if specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as established  otherwise by the permitting authority in the source's title V permit).  The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or  postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or  other calendar reporting period, as appropriate). If the owner or  operator is required to submit excess emissions and continuous  monitoring system performance (or other periodic) reports under this  part, the startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports required under this  paragraph may be submitted simultaneously with the excess emissions and  continuous monitoring system performance (or other) reports. If startup,  shutdown, and malfunction reports are submitted with excess emissions  and continuous monitoring system performance (or other periodic)  reports, and the owner or operator receives approval to reduce the  frequency of reporting for the latter under paragraph (e) of this  section, the frequency of reporting for the startup, shutdown, and  malfunction reports also may be reduced if the Administrator does not  object to the intended change. The procedures to implement the allowance  in the preceding sentence shall be the same as the procedures specified  in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> are specified in Sec. 63.9(i).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional reporting requirements for sources with continuous  monitoring systems--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. When more than one CEMS is used to  measure the emissions from one affected source (e.g., multiple  breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the  results as required for each CEMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reporting results of continuous monitoring system performance  evaluations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source required to  install a CMS by a relevant standard shall furnish the Administrator a  copy of a written report of the results of the CMS performance  evaluation, as required under Sec. 63.8(e), simultaneously with the  results of the performance test required under Sec. 63.7, unless  otherwise specified in the relevant standard.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator of an affected source using a COMS to  determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under  Sec. 63.7 and described in Sec. 63.6(d)(6) shall furnish the  Administrator two or, upon request, three copies of a written report of  the results of the COMS performance evaluation conducted under  Sec. 63.8(e). The copies shall be furnished at least 15 calendar days  before the performance test required under Sec. 63.7 is conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance  report and summary report. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Excess emissions and parameter monitoring  exceedances are defined in relevant standards. The owner or operator of  an affected source required to install a CMS by a relevant standard  shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system  performance report and/or a summary report to the Administrator  semiannually, except when--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> More frequent reporting is specifically required by a relevant  standard;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The Administrator determines on a case-by-case basis that more  frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance  status of the source; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The affected source is complying with the Performance Track  Provisions of Sec. 63.16, which allows less frequent reporting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Request to reduce frequency of excess emissions and continuous  monitoring system performance reports. Notwithstanding the frequency of  reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section,  an owner or operator who is required by a relevant standard to submit  excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance (and  summary) reports on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the  frequency of reporting for that standard to semiannual if the following  conditions are met:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting  periods) the affected source's excess emissions and continuous  monitoring system performance reports continually demonstrate that the  source is in compliance with the relevant standard;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping  and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and the relevant  standard; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of  reporting for the affected source, as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and continuous  monitoring system performance (and summary) reports required to comply  with a relevant standard may be reduced only after the owner or operator  notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make  such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended  change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting,  the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire  previous performance history during the 5-year recordkeeping period  prior to the intended change, including performance test results,  monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance  with operation and maintenance requirements. Such information may be  used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's  potential for noncompliance in the future. If the   Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the  frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or  operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner  or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the  owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is  based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days,  approval is automatically granted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> As soon as CMS data indicate that the source is not in  compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter specified  in the relevant standard, the frequency of reporting shall revert to the  frequency specified in the relevant standard, and the owner or operator  shall submit an excess emissions and continuous monitoring system  performance (and summary) report for the noncomplying emission points at  the next appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event.  After demonstrating ongoing compliance with the relevant standard for  another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from  the Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that  standard, as provided for in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (e)(3)(iii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Content and submittal dates for excess emissions and monitoring  system performance reports. All excess emissions and monitoring system  performance reports and all summary reports, if required, shall be  delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each  calendar half or quarter, as appropriate. Written reports of excess  emissions or exceedances of process or control system parameters shall  include all the information required in paragraphs (c)(5) through  (c)(13) of this section, in Secs. 63.8(c)(7) and 63.8(c)(8), and in the  relevant standard, and they shall contain the name, title, and signature  of the responsible official who is certifying the accuracy of the  report. When no excess emissions or exceedances of a parameter have  occurred, or a CMS has not been inoperative, out of control, repaired,  or adjusted, such information shall be stated in the report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Summary report. As required under paragraphs (e)(3)(vii) and  (e)(3)(viii) of this section, one summary report shall be submitted for  the hazardous air pollutants monitored at each affected source (unless  the relevant standard specifies that more than one summary report is  required, e.g., one summary report for each hazardous air pollutant  monitored). The summary report shall be entitled ``Summary Report-- Gaseous and Opacity Excess Emission and Continuous Monitoring System  Performance'' and shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The company name and address of the affected source;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An identification of each hazardous air pollutant monitored at  the affected source;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A brief description of the process units;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The emission and operating parameter limitations specified in  the relevant standard(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The monitoring equipment manufacturer(s) and model number(s);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> The date of the latest CMS certification or audit;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> The total operating time of the affected source during the  reporting period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> An emission data summary (or similar summary if the owner or  operator monitors control system parameters), including the total  duration of excess emissions during the reporting period (recorded in  minutes for opacity and hours for gases), the total duration of excess  emissions expressed as a percent of the total source operating time  during that reporting period, and a breakdown of the total duration of  excess emissions during the reporting period into those that are due to  startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other  known causes, and other unknown causes;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> A CMS performance summary (or similar summary if the owner or  operator monitors control system parameters), including the total CMS  downtime during the reporting period (recorded in minutes for opacity  and hours for gases), the total duration of CMS downtime expressed as a  percent   of the total source operating time during that reporting period, and a  breakdown of the total CMS downtime during the reporting period into  periods that are due to monitoring equipment malfunctions, nonmonitoring  equipment malfunctions, quality assurance/quality control calibrations,  other known causes, and other unknown causes;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> A description of any changes in CMS, processes, or controls  since the last reporting period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(L)</em> The name, title, and signature of the responsible official who  is certifying the accuracy of the report; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(M)</em> The date of the report.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If the total duration of excess emissions or process or  control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is less  than 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, and  CMS downtime for the reporting period is less than 5 percent of the  total operating time for the reporting period, only the summary report  shall be submitted, and the full excess emissions and continuous  monitoring system performance report need not be submitted unless  required by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> If the total duration of excess emissions or process or  control system parameter exceedances for the reporting period is 1  percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period,  or the total CMS downtime for the reporting period is 5 percent or  greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, both the  summary report and the excess emissions and continuous monitoring system  performance report shall be submitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reporting continuous opacity monitoring system data produced  during a performance test. The owner or operator of an affected source  required to use a COMS shall record the monitoring data produced during  a performance test required under Sec. 63.7 and shall furnish the  Administrator a written report of the monitoring results. The report of  COMS data shall be submitted simultaneously with the report of the  performance test results required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Until a  waiver of a recordkeeping or reporting requirement has been granted by  the Administrator under this paragraph, the owner or operator of an  affected source remains subject to the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recordkeeping or reporting requirements may be waived upon  written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's  judgment, the affected source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or  the source is operating under an extension of compliance, or the owner  or operator has requested an extension of compliance and the  Administrator is still considering that request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is  made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of  compliance under Sec. 63.6(i), any required compliance progress report  or compliance status report required under this part (such as under  Secs. 63.6(i) and 63.9(h)) or in the source's title V permit, or an  excess emissions and continuous monitoring system performance report  required under paragraph (e) of this section, whichever is applicable.
