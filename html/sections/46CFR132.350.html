If any of the equipment or records have not been properly maintained, a qualified servicing facility may be required to perform the required inspections, maintenance, and hydrostatic tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following tests and inspections of fire-extinguishing equipment must be performed by the owner, operator, or master, or by a qualified servicing facility, to verify compliance with paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each portable fire extinguisher must be inspected, maintained, and hydrostatically tested as required by Chapter 4 of NFPA 10 with the frequency specified by NFPA 10. Carbon-dioxide and halon portable fire extinguishers must be refilled when the weight loss of net content exceeds that specified for fixed systems by Table 132.350. Further, each must be examined for excessive corrosion and for general condition. A tag issued by a qualified servicing facility, and attached to each extinguisher, will be acceptable evidence that the necessary maintenance has been conducted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each semiportable fire extinguisher and each fixed fire-extinguishing system must be--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspected and tested as required by Table 132.350 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspected, tested, and marked as required by Sec. Sec.  147.60 and 147.65 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Inspected to ensure that piping, controls, and valves are in good general condition with no excessive corrosion; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inspected and tested to determine that alarms and ventilation shutdowns for each fire-extinguishing system operate properly.</p><p class="depth4">Table 132.350--Tests of Semiportable and Fixed Fire-Extinguishing Systems----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Type of system                                                Test----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carbon dioxide......................................
