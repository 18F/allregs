                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the contracting officer selects the milestone payment method  (see Sec. 603.805), the contracting officer must assess the  reasonableness of the estimated amount for reaching each milestone. This  assessment enables the contracting officer to set the amount of each  milestone payment to approximate the Federal share of the anticipated  resource needs for carrying out that phase of the RD&D; effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Federal share at each milestone need not be the same as the  Federal share of the total project. For example, the contracting officer  might deliberately set payment amounts with a larger Federal share for  early milestones if a project involves a start-up company with limited  resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For an expenditure-based TIA, if the contracting officer  establishes minimum cost sharing percentages for each milestone, those  percentages should be indicated in the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For a fixed-support TIA, the milestone payments should be  associated with the well-defined, observable, and verifiable technical  outcomes (e.g., demonstrations, tests, or data analysis) that are  established for the project in accordance with Secs. 603.305(a) and  603.560(a).</p>
