                                Sec. 417.219  Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. For each launch, a flight safety analysis must establish data loss flight times, as identified by paragraph (b) of this section, and a planned safe flight state to establish each flight termination rule that applies when launch vehicle tracking data is not available for use by the flight safety crew. Section 417.113(d) contains requirements for flight termination rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Data loss flight times. A flight safety analysis must establish the shortest elapsed thrusting time during which a launch vehicle can move from normal flight to a condition where the launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion extends to any protected area as a data loss flight time. The analysis must establish a data loss flight time for all times along the nominal trajectory from liftoff through that point during nominal flight when the minimum elapsed thrusting time is no greater than the time it would take for a normal vehicle to reach the overflight gate, or the planned safe flight state established under paragraph (c) of this section, whichever occurs earlier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Planned safe flight state. For a launch vehicle that performs normally during all portions of flight, the planned safe flight state is the point during the nominal flight of a launch vehicle where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No launch vehicle component, debris, or hazard can impact or affect a populated or otherwise protected area for the remainder of the launch;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The launch vehicle achieves orbital insertion; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The launch vehicle's state vector reaches a state where the absence of a

flight safety system would not significantly increase the accumulated risk from debris impacts and maintains positive flight safety system control to the maximum extent feasible.</p>
