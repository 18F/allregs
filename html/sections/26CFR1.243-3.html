                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 243(d) and this section do not apply to dividends paid  out of earnings and profits accumulated (i) by a corporation organized  under the China Trade Act, 1922, (ii) by a domestic corporation during  any period with respect to which such corporation was exempt from  taxation under section 501 (relating to certain charitable, etc.  organizations) or 521 (relating to farmers' cooperative associations),  or (iii) by a domestic corporation during any period to which section  931 (relating to income from sources within possessions of the United  States), as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1,  1976, applied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Establishing separate earnings and profits accounts. A foreign  corporation shall, for purposes of section 243(d), maintain a separate  account for earnings and profits to which it succeeds which were  accumulated by a domestic corporation, and such foreign corporation  shall treat such earnings and profits as having been accumulated during  the accounting periods in which earned by such domestic corporation.  Such foreign corporation shall also maintain such a separate account for  the earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits,  accumulated by it or accumulated by any other corporations to the  earnings and profits of which it succeeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effect of dividends on earnings and profits accounts. Dividends  paid out of the accumulated earnings and profits (see section 316(a)(1)  of such foreign corporation shall be treated as having been paid out of  the most recently accumulated earnings and profits of such corporation.  A deficit in an earnings and profits account for any accounting period  shall reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a  prior accounting period in such account. If there are no accumulated  earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account because of a  deficit incurred in a prior accounting period, such deficit must be  restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent  accounting period. If a dividend is paid out of earnings and profits of  a foreign corporation which maintains two or more accounts (established  under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section) with respect to  two or more accounting periods ending on the same day, then the portion  of such dividend considered as paid out of each account shall be the  same proportion of the total dividend as the amount of earnings and  profits in that account bears to the sum of the earnings and profits in  all such accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Illustration. The application of the principles of this section  in the determination of the amount of the dividends received deduction  may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. On December 31, 1960, corporation X, a calendar-year  corporation organized in the United States on January 1, 1958,  consolidated with corporation Y, a foreign corporation organized on  January 1, 1958, which used an annual accounting period based on the  calendar year, to form corporation Z, a foreign corporation not engaged  in trade or business within the United States. Corporation Z is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of corporation M, a domestic corporation. On  January 1, 1961, corporation Z's accumulated earnings and profits of  $31,000 are, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section,  maintained in separate earnings and profits accounts containing the  following amounts:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Domestic   Foreign</p><p class="depth0">Earnings and profits accumulated for--         corp.
