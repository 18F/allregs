                            <p class="depth0">A requester deemed eligible by the Secretary who seeks benefits for  lost   employment income from the Program must submit, in addition to the  documentation submitted under subpart F, documentation describing:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The number of days (including partial days) of work missed by  the smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact as a result of the  covered injury or its health complications for which employment income  was lost (e.g., time sheet from pay period reflecting work days missed).  As stated in Sec.  102.32(c), days for which an individual used paid  leave in order to be paid for lost work will be considered days of work  for which employment income was received (unless the individual's  employer restores the leave that was used by putting the individual in  the same position as if he or she had not used paid leave);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact's gross  employment income at the time the covered injury was sustained (e.g.,  the individual's most recent Federal tax return or a pay stub from the  time of the covered injury);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whether the smallpox vaccine recipient or vaccinia contact had  one or more dependents at the time the covered injury was sustained  (e.g., the individual's most recent Federal tax return); and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All third-party payors that have paid for or that may be  required to pay the requester benefits for loss of employment income or  provide disability and retirement benefits for which payment or  reimbursement is being sought under this Program (e.g., State workers'  compensation programs, disability insurance programs, etc.). A requester  must submit documentation, if available, concerning the amount of such  payments or benefits expected to be paid by third-party payors. If the  requester knows of no such third-party payor, he or she must certify to  that fact. If, at any time, the requester becomes aware that a third- party payor may have such an obligation, the requester must inform the  Secretary within 10 business days of becoming aware of this information.</p>
