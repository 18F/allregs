                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. An organizational profile is a depiction of the staffing pattern within an establishment. It is one method contractors use to determine whether barriers to equal employment opportunity exist in their organizations. The profile provides an overview of the workforce at the establishment that may assist in identifying organizational units where women or minorities are underrepresented or concentrated. The contractor must use either the organizational display or the workforce analysis as its organizational profile:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organizational display. (1) An organizational display is a detailed graphical or tabular chart, text, spreadsheet or similar presentation of the contractor's organizational structure. The organizational display must identify each organizational unit in the establishment, and show the relationship of each organizational unit to the other organizational units in the establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An organizational display is a detailed graphical or tabular chart, text, spreadsheet or similar presentation of the contractor's organizational structure. The organizational display must identify each organizational unit in the establishment, and show the relationship of each organizational unit to the other organizational units in the establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An organizational unit is any component that is part of the contractor's corporate structure. In a more traditional organization, an organizational unit might be a department, division, section, branch, group or similar component. In a less traditional organization, an organizational unit might be a project team, job family, or similar component. The term includes an umbrella unit (such as a department) that contains a number of subordinate units, and it separately includes each of the subordinate units (such as sections or branches).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each organizational unit, the organizational display must indicate the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The name of the unit;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The job title, gender, race, and ethnicity of the unit supervisor (if the unit has a supervisor);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total number of male and female incumbents; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> the total number of male and female incumbents in each of the following groups: Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Workforce analysis. (1) A workforce analysis is a listing of each job title as appears in applicable collective bargaining agreements or payroll records ranked from the lowest paid to the highest paid within each department or

other similar organizational unit including departmental or unit supervision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A workforce analysis is a listing of each job title as appears in applicable collective bargaining agreements or payroll records ranked from the lowest paid to the highest paid within each department or

other similar organizational unit including departmental or unit supervision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there are separate work units or lines of progression within a department, a separate list must be provided for each such work unit, or line, including unit supervisors. For lines of progression there must be indicated the order of jobs in the line through which an employee could move to the top of the line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where there are no formal progression lines or usual promotional sequences, job titles should be listed by department, job families, or disciplines, in order of wage rates or salary ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each job title, the total number of incumbents, the total number of male and female incumbents, and the total number of male and female incumbents in each of the following groups must be given: Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given. All job titles, including all managerial job titles, must be listed.</p>
