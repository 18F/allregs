American Society for Testing and Materials is a nonprofit organization that provides an international forum for the development and publication of voluntary consensus standards for materials, products, systems, and services.</p><p class="depth0">Biobased content. The amount of biobased carbon in the material or product expressed as a percent of weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the material or product. For BioPreferred Products (products that have been identified for Federal preferred procurement), the biobased content shall be defined and determined as specified in the applicable section of subpart B of part 3201. For all other products, the biobased content is to be determined using ASTM Method D6866, Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid,

Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">Biobased product. A product determined by the Secretary to be a commercial or industrial product (other than food or feed) that is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Composed, in whole or in significant part, of biological products, including renewable domestic agricultural materials and forestry materials; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> An intermediate ingredient or feedstock. For the purposes of this subpart, the term `biobased product' does not include motor vehicle fuels, heating oil, electricity produced from biomass, or any mature market products.</p><p class="depth2">BioPreferred Product. A biobased product that meets or exceeds minimum biobased content levels set by USDA, and that is found within any of the product categories that have been identified, in subpart B of 7 CFR part 3201, whose products within are eligible for Federal preferred procurement/purchasing.</p><p class="depth2">Certification mark. A combination of the certification mark artwork (as defined in this subpart); one of three statements identifying whether the USDA certification applies to the product, the package, or both the product and package; and, where applicable, the letters ``FP'' to indicate that the product is within a designated product category and eligible for Federal preferred procurement.

As used in this part means calendar days.</p><p class="depth2">Designated item. For the purposes of this part means product categories (generic groupings of products that perform the same function) within which the products have been afforded a procurement preference by Federal agencies under the BioPreferred Program.

An entity authorized by a manufacturer or vendor to affix the USDA certification mark to the manufacturer's or vendor's certified biobased product or its packaging.</p><p class="depth2">Intermediate ingredients or feedstocks. Materials or compounds made in whole or in significant part from biological products, including renewable agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials) or forestry materials, that are subsequently used to make a more complex compound or
