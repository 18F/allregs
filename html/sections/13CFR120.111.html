                            <p class="depth0">An Eligible Passive Company must use loan proceeds to acquire or  lease, and/or improve or renovate, real or personal property (including  eligible refinancing), that it leases to one or more Operating Companies  for conducting the Operating Company's business (references to Operating  Company in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section mean each Operating  Company). Any ownership structure or legal form may qualify as an  Eligible Passive Company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions that apply to all legal forms:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Operating Company must be an eligible small business, and  the proposed use of the proceeds must be an eligible use if the  Operating Company were obtaining the financing directly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Eligible Passive Company (with the exception of a trust) and  the Operating Company each must be small under the appropriate size  standards in part 121 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating  Company must be in writing and must be subordinated to SBA's mortgage,  trust deed lien, or security interest on the property. Also, the  Eligible Passive Company (as landlord) must furnish as collateral for  the loan an assignment of all rents paid under the lease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating  Company, including options to renew exercisable solely by the Operating  Company, must have a remaining term at least equal to the term of the  loan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Operating Company must be a guarantor or co-borrower with  the Eligible Passive Company. In a 7(a) loan that includes working  capital and/or the purchase of other assets, including intangible  assets, for the Operating Company's use, the Operating Company must be a  co-borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each holder of an ownership interest constituting at least 20  percent of the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company must  guarantee the loan (the trustee shall execute the guarantee on behalf of  any trust).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional conditions that apply to trusts. The eligibility  status of the trustor will determine trust eligibility. All donors to  the trust will be deemed to have trustor status for eligibility  purposes. A trust qualifying as an Eligible Passive Company may engage  in other activities as authorized by its trust agreement. The trustee  must warrant and certify that the trust will not be revoked or  substantially amended for the term of the loan without the consent of  SBA. The trustor must guarantee the loan. For purposes of this section,  the trustee shall certify to SBA that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The trustee has authority to act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The trust has the authority to borrow funds, pledge trust  assets, and lease the property to the Operating Company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The trustee has provided accurate, pertinent language from the  trust agreement confirming the above; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The trustee has provided and will continue to provide SBA with a  true and complete list of all trustors and donors.
