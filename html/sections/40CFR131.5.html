The review involves a determination of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the State has adopted water uses which are consistent with the requirements of the Clean Water Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the State has adopted criteria that protect the designated water uses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the State has followed its legal procedures for revising or adopting standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the State standards which do not include the uses specified in section 101(a)(2) of the Act are based upon appropriate technical and scientific data and analyses, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the State submission meets the requirements included in Sec. 131.6 of this part and, for Great Lakes States or Great Lakes Tribes (as defined in 40 CFR 132.2) to conform to section 118 of the Act, the requirements of 40 CFR part 132.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If EPA determines that the State's or Tribe's water quality standards are consistent with the factors listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, EPA approves the standards.
