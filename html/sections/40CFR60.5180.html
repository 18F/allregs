                                Sec. 60.5180  Do the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The emission limits and standards apply at all times and during  periods of malfunction. The operating limits apply at all times that  sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage  sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not  less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time). For  determining compliance with the CO concentration limit using CO CEMS,  the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of  startup or shutdown. Use the measured CO concentration without  correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other CO  concentrations (corrected to 7 percent O2) to determine the  24-hour average value.</p>
