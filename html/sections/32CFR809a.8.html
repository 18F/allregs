The more important laws  concerning military aid to civil authorities are also summarized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Air Force gives military assistance to civil authorities in  civil defense or civil disturbances and disasters only when such  assistance is requested or directed. Commanders will not undertake such  assistance without authority, unless the overruling demands of humanity  compel immediate action to protect life and property and to restore  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The military service having available resources nearest the  affected area is responsible for providing initial assistance to civil  authorities in emergencies. Subsequent operations are to be according to  the mutual agreement between the senior service commanders concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The protection of life and property and the maintenance of law  and order within the territorial jurisdiction of any State is the  primary responsibility of State and local authorities. It is well- established U.S. Government policy that intervention with military  forces takes place only after State and local authorities have used  their own forces and are unable to control the situation, or when they  do not take appropriate action.</p>
