                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, and 224. (Consular offices  designated to issue immigrant visas are listed periodically in Visa  Office Bulletins published at www.travel.state.gov by the Department of  State.) A consular officer assigned to duty in the territory of a  country against which the sanctions provided in INA 243(d) have been  invoked must not issue an immigrant visa to an alien who is a national,  citizen, subject, or resident of that country, unless the officer has  been informed that the sanction has been waived by DHS in the case of an  individual alien or a specified class of aliens.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Immigrant visa fees. The Secretary of State prescribes a fee for  the processing of immigrant visa applications. An individual registered  for immigrant visa processing at a post designated for this purpose by  the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services must pay the processing  fee upon being notified that a visa is expected to become available in  the near future and being requested to obtain the supporting  documentation needed to apply formally for a visa. A fee collected for  the processing of an immigrant visa application is refundable only if  the principal officer of a post or the officer in charge of a consular  section determines that the application was not adjudicated as a result  of action by the U. S. Government over which the alien had no control  and for which the alien was not responsible, that precluded the  applicant from benefiting from the processing.  [67 FR 38893, June 6, 2002]</p>
