All registered withdrawals shall re-register with the Commission within five years of their initial registration, and at five-year intervals thereafter, unless the withdrawal is sooner discontinued. Upon notice by the Executive Director, compliance with a registration or reporting requirement, or both, of a member state that is substantially equivalent to this requirement shall be considered compliance with this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project sponsors whose existing agricultural water use projects i.e., projects coming into existence prior to March 31, 1997) withdraw or divert in excess of an average of 10,000 gpd for any consecutive 30-day period from a ground or surface water source shall register their use no later than March 31, 1997.
