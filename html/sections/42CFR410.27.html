                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Medicare Part B pays for therapeutic hospital or CAH services  and supplies furnished incident to a physician's or nonphysician  practitioner's service, which are defined as all services and supplies  furnished to hospital or CAH outpatients that are not diagnostic  services and that aid the physician or nonphysician practitioner in the  treatment of the patient, including drugs and biologicals which are not  usually self-administered, if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are furnished--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By or under arrangements made by the participating hospital or  CAH, except in the case of a SNF resident as provided in Sec. 411.15(p)  of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As an integral although incidental part of a physician's or  nonphysician practitioner's services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the hospital or CAH or in a department of the hospital or  CAH, as defined in Sec. 413.65 of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Under the direct supervision (or other level of supervision as  specified by CMS for the particular service) of a physician or a  nonphysician practitioner as specified in paragraph (g) of this section,  subject to the following requirements:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For services furnished in the hospital or CAH, or in an  outpatient department of the hospital or CAH, both on and off-campus, as  defined in Sec. 413.65 of this subchapter, ``direct supervision'' means  that the physician or nonphysician practitioner must be immediately  available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance  of the procedure. It does not mean that the physician or nonphysician  practitioner must be present in the room when the procedure is  performed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Certain therapeutic services and supplies may be assigned either  general supervision or personal supervision. When such assignment is  made, general supervision means the definition specified at Sec.  410.32(b)(3)(i), and personal supervision means the definition specified  at Sec. 410.32(b)(3)(iii);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Nonphysician practitioners may provide the required supervision  of services that they may personally furnish in accordance with State  law and all additional requirements, including those specified in  Sec. Sec. 410.71, 410.73, 410.74, 410.75, 410.76, and 410.77;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> For pulmonary rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and  intensive cardiac rehabilitation services, direct supervision must be  furnished by a doctor of medicine or a doctor of osteopathy, as  specified in Sec. Sec. 410.47 and 410.49, respectively; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> For nonsurgical extended duration therapeutic services (extended  duration services), which are hospital or CAH outpatient therapeutic  services that can last a significant period of time, have a substantial  monitoring component that is typically performed by auxiliary personnel,  have a low risk of   requiring the physician's or appropriate nonphysician practitioner's  immediate availability after the initiation of the service, and are not  primarily surgical in nature, Medicare requires a minimum of direct  supervision during the initiation of the service which may be followed  by general supervision at the discretion of the supervising physician or  the appropriate nonphysician practitioner. Initiation means the  beginning portion of the nonsurgical extended duration therapeutic  service which ends when the patient is stable and the supervising  physician or the appropriate nonphysician practitioner determines that  the remainder of the service can be delivered safely under general  supervision; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In accordance with applicable State law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of partial hospitalization services, also meet the  conditions of paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Drugs and biologicals are also subject to the limitations  specified in Sec. 410.129.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rules on emergency services furnished to outpatients by  nonparticipating hospitals are specified in subpart G of Part 424 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rules on emergency services furnished to outpatients in a  foreign country are specified in subpart H of Part 424 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Medicare Part B pays for partial hospitalization services if  they are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prescribed by a physician who certifies and recertifies the need  for the services in accordance with subpart B of part 424 of this  chapter; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Furnished under a plan of treatment as required under subpart B  of part 424 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Services furnished by an entity other than the hospital are  subject to the limitations specified in Sec. 410.42(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For purposes of this section, ``nonphysician practitioner'''  means a clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker,  physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or  certified nurse-midwife.
