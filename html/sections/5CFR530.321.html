                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section and Sec. Sec. 530.322 and 530.323 provide conversion rules for setting an employee's pay when a special rate schedule is established, increased, decreased, or discontinued, or when an employee's coverage under an existing special rate schedule is affected by a change in coverage criteria. These conversion rules do not apply to changes in an employee's special rate entitlements based on a change in the employee's position of record or official worksite. Pay-setting rules for other personnel actions affecting special rate employees are provided in 5 CFR parts 531 and 536. For example, if an employee becomes covered by a special rate schedule as a result of a change in the employee's official worksite, the geographic conversion rule in 5 CFR 531.205 must be used to set the employee's rate(s) of basic pay in the new location before considering any other simultaneous pay action (other than a general pay adjustment).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The conversion rules in Sec. Sec. 530.322 and 530.323 are considered general pay adjustments for the purpose of applying 5 CFR 531.206 (dealing with the order of precedence for processing simultaneous pay actions). The rate(s) of pay resulting from these conversion rules are considered the employee's existing rate(s) of pay before processing the next simultaneous pay action in the order of precedence.</p>
