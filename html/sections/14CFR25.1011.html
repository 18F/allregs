Instead of a rational analysis of airplane range for the purpose of computing oil requirements for reciprocating engine powered airplanes, the following fuel/oil ratios may be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For airplanes without a reserve oil or oil transfer system, a fuel/oil ratio of 30:1 by volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For airplanes with either a reserve oil or oil transfer system, a fuel/oil ratio of 40:1 by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fuel/oil ratios higher than those prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section may be used if substantiated by data on actual engine oil consumption.</p>
