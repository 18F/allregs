                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pursuant to section 1308 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21 (Pub. L. 105-178), an MPO(s), State(s), or public transportation operator(s) may undertake a multimodal, systems-level corridor or subarea planning study as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process. To the extent practicable, development of these transportation planning studies shall involve consultation with, or joint efforts among, the MPO(s), State(s), and/or public

transportation operator(s). The results or decisions of these transportation planning studies may be used as part of the overall project development process consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and associated implementing regulations (23 CFR part 771 and 40 CFR parts 1500-1508). Specifically, these corridor or subarea studies may result in producing any of the following for a proposed transportation project:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and need or goals and objective statement(s);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General travel corridor and/or general mode(s) definition (e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Preliminary screening of alternatives and elimination of unreasonable alternatives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Basic description of the environmental setting; and/or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Preliminary identification of environmental impacts and environmental mitigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Publicly available documents or other source material produced by, or in support of, the transportation planning process described in this subpart may be incorporated directly or by reference into subsequent NEPA documents, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NEPA lead agencies agree that such incorporation will aid in establishing or evaluating the purpose and need for the Federal action, reasonable alternatives, cumulative or other impacts on the human and natural environment, or mitigation of these impacts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The systems-level, corridor, or subarea planning study is conducted with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Involvement of interested State, local, Tribal, and Federal agencies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Public review;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonable opportunity to comment during the metropolitan transportation planning process and development of the corridor or subarea planning study;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documentation of relevant decisions in a form that is identifiable and available for review during the NEPA scoping process and can be appended to or referenced in the NEPA document; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The review of the FHWA and the FTA, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> By agreement of the NEPA lead agencies, the above integration may be accomplished through tiering (as described in 40 CFR 1502.20), incorporating the subarea or corridor planning study into the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or Environmental Assessment, or other means that the NEPA lead agencies deem appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For transit fixed guideway projects requiring an Alternatives Analysis (49 U.S.C. 5309(d) and (e)), the Alternatives Analysis described in 49 CFR part 611 constitutes the planning required by section 1308 of the TEA-21. The Alternatives Analysis may or may not be combined with the preparation of a NEPA document (e.g., a draft EIS). When an Alternatives Analysis is separate from the preparation of a NEPA document, the results of the Alternatives Analysis may be used during a subsequent environmental review process as described in paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional information to further explain the linkages between the transportation planning and project development/NEPA processes is contained in Appendix A to this part, including an explanation that it is non-binding guidance material.</p>
