                                Sec. 160.156-11  Fabrication of prototype rescue boats and fast rescue
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the manufacturer is notified that the information submitted  in accordance with Sec. 160.156-9 of this subpart is satisfactory to  the Commandant, the manufacturer may proceed with fabrication of the  prototype rescue boat as set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless the Commandant directs otherwise, an independent  laboratory must perform or witness, as appropriate, inspections, tests,  and oversight required by this section. Prototype inspections and tests  of a rescue boat must be carried out in accordance with the procedures  for independent laboratory inspection in 46 CFR part 159, subpart  159.007 and in this section, unless the Commandant authorizes  alternative tests and inspections. The Commandant may prescribe  additional prototype tests and inspections necessary to maintain quality  control and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fabrication of a rescue boat must proceed in the following  sequence:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer must arrange for an independent laboratory (or  Coast Guard inspector if required under paragraph (b) of this section)  to inspect, test, and oversee the rescue boat during its fabrication and  prepare an inspection and test report meeting the requirements of 46 CFR  159.005-11.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The independent laboratory must make such inspections as are  necessary to determine that the prototype is constructed by the methods  and with the materials specified in the plans reviewed under Sec.  160.156-9 of this subpart. By conducting at least one inspection during  its construction, the independent laboratory must determine the  prototype rescue boat conforms with those plans by inspecting--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Construction. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> FRP components  of each prototype rescue boat outer hull and any FRP inner hull or liner  components that are bonded or bolted to the outer hull must have a layup  made of unpigmented clear resins so that details of construction are  visible for inspection. Test panels representative of each prototype  layup must be tested in accordance with MIL-P-17549D(SH) (incorporated  by reference, see Sec. 160.156-5 of this subpart). If an accepted MIL- R-21607E(SH) Grade B resin is used for the prototype rescue boat,  additives for fire retardancy must not be used so that the laminate is  translucent for inspection purposes. A prototype test rescue boat with  Grade B resins will not be marked in accordance with Sec. 160.156-17 of  this subpart for use as a production rescue boat regardless of the  outcome of the performance tests. Whichever accepted resin the  manufacturer decides to use for the prototype rescue boat, the same  resin must be used in the production rescue boats.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The hull, canopy, and major structural laminates of each  prototype FRP rescue boat must be tested for resin content, ultimate  flexural strength, and tensile strength. The test samples must be cut  out from the prototype rescue boat, or be laid up at the same time,  using the same procedures and by the same operators as the laminate used  in the rescue boat. The number of samples used for each test, and the  conditions and test methods used, must be as per the applicable test  specified in this paragraph. The resin content must be determined as per  ASTM D 2584 or ISO 1172 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.156-5  of this subpart). The flexural ultimate strength must be determined by  ASTM D 790 method I (test condition ``A'', flatwise, dry) or the  corresponding ISO 14125 test method (incorporated by reference, see  Sec. 160.156-5 of this subpart). The tensile strength, lengthwise, must  be determined as per ASTM D 638 or ISO 527 (incorporated by reference,  see Sec. 160.156-5 of this subpart).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Each major FRP component, such as the hull, canopy, and inner  liner(s) of each prototype FRP rescue boat, must be examined and weighed  after it is completed but before it is assembled. If the rescue boat is  constructed by the spray lay-up technique, the hull and canopy  thicknesses must be measured using ultrasonic or equivalent techniques;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Steel construction. Steel sheet and plate used for the hull,  floors, and other structural components of a prototype steel rescue boat  must meet the bend tests requirement specified under ASTM A 653  (incorporated by reference,   see Sec. 160.156-5 of this subpart) after galvanizing or other anti- corrosion treatment has been applied. This may be demonstrated through  supplier's certification papers or through witnessing actual tests;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Welding. Structural components of each prototype rescue boat  joined by welding must be joined by the welding procedures and materials  per the plans reviewed under Sec. 160.156-9 of this subpart and by  welders appropriately qualified;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Buoyancy material. If block foam buoyancy material is used,  each piece must be weighed after it is cut and shaped to make sure that  the correct amount of foam is installed. If foamed-in-place buoyancy  material is used, a separate sample of the foam must be poured, and used  to make a density determination after it has set. The density must be 32  8 kg/m\3\ (2 0.5 lb/ft\3\).  Each major subassembly such as the hull-with-liner and canopy-with-liner  must be weighed after the buoyancy foam is installed and before it is  further assembled;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Coated fabric. Coated fabric for inflatable collars used in the  construction of each rescue boat must meet the requirements specified  under Sec. 160.156-7(b)(3) of this subpart. This may be demonstrated  through a supplier's certification papers or through witnessing actual  tests;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Installation of the propulsion system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Installation of the steering system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The independent laboratory must submit the inspection report to  the Commandant.</p>
