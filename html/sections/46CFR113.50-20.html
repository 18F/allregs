The distribution panel must be above the uppermost continuous deck, in the zone served, and there must be no disconnect switches for the branch circuits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A branch circuit must not supply speakers on more than one deck level, except for a single branch circuit supplying all levels of a single space if all other requirements of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> On a vessel not divided into vertical fire zones by main vertical fire bulkheads, the vessel must be divided into vertical zones not more than 40 meters (131 feet) long. There must be a feeder for each of these zones.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Feeders and branch circuit cables must be in passageways. They must not be in staterooms, lockers, galleys, or machinery spaces, unless it is necessary to supply public address speakers in those spaces.
