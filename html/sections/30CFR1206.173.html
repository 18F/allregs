(1) If you are required to perform the accounting for comparison (dual accounting) under Sec. 1206.176, you have two choices. You may elect to perform the dual accounting calculation according to either Sec. 1206.176(a) (called actual dual accounting), or paragraph (b) of this section (called the alternative methodology for dual accounting).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are required to perform the accounting for comparison (dual accounting) under Sec. 1206.176, you have two choices. You may elect to perform the dual accounting calculation according to either Sec. 1206.176(a) (called actual dual accounting), or paragraph (b) of this section (called the alternative methodology for dual accounting).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must make a separate election to use the alternative methodology for dual accounting for your Indian leases in each ONRR-designated area. Your election for a designated area must apply to all of your Indian leases in that area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ONRR will publish in the Federal Register a list of the lease prefixes that will be associated with each designated area for purposes of this section. The ONRR-designated areas are as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Alabama-Coushatta;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Blackfeet Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Crow Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Fort Belknap Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Fort Berthold Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Fort Peck Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Jicarilla Apache Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> ONRR-designated groups of counties in the State of Oklahoma;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Navajo Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Northern Cheyenne Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> Rocky Boys Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(L)</em> Southern Ute Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(M)</em> Turtle Mountain Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(N)</em> Ute Mountain Ute Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(O)</em> Uintah and Ouray Reservation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(P)</em> Wind River Reservation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(Q)</em> Any other area that ONRR designates.

The first election to use the alternative methodology will be effective from the time of election through the end of the following calendar year. Thereafter, each election to use the alternative methodology must remain in effect for 2 calendar years. You may return to the actual dual accounting method only at the beginning of the next election period or with the written approval of ONRR and the tribal lessor for tribal leases, and ONRR for Indian allottee leases in the designated area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When you elect to use the alternative methodology for a designated area, you must also use the alternative methodology for any new wells commenced and any new leases acquired in the designated area during the term of the election.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculating value using the alternative methodology for dual accounting. (1) The alternative methodology adjusts the value of gas before processing determined under either Sec. 1206.172 or Sec. 1206.174 to provide the value of the gas after processing. You must use the value of the gas after processing for royalty payment purposes. The amount of the increase depends on your relationship with the owner(s) of the plant where the gas is processed. If you have no direct or indirect ownership interest in the processing plant, then the increase is lower, as provided in the table in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. If you have a direct or indirect ownership interest in the plant where the gas is processed, the increase is higher, as

provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The alternative methodology adjusts the value of gas before processing determined under either Sec. 1206.172 or Sec. 1206.174 to provide the value of the gas after processing.

All gas production from the lease is subject to dual accounting and you must use the alternative method for all that gas production if you elected to use the alternative method under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Weighted-average Btu content determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section is less than or equal to 1,000 Btu/cf. Only the volumes of lease production measured at facility measurement points whose quality exceeds 1,000 Btu/cf are subject to dual accounting, and you may use the alternative methodology for these volumes. For gas measured at facility measurement points for these leases where the quality is equal to or less than 1,000 Btu/cf, you are not required to do dual accounting.</p>
