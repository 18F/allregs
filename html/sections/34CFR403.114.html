The Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether other indices of economic status are more representative of the number of economically disadvantaged students attending vocational education programs, taking into consideration, for example, the statistical reliability of

any data submitted by a grantee as well as the general acceptance of the indices by other agencies in the State or local area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a State elects to use more than one factor described in paragraph (a) of this section for purposes of determining the number of economically disadvantaged students enrolled in vocational education programs, the State shall ensure that the data used are not duplicative.
