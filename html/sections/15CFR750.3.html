                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Review by BIS. In reviewing specific license applications, BIS will conduct a complete analysis of the license application along with all documentation submitted in support of the application. In addition to reviewing the item and end-use, BIS will consider the reliability of each party to the transaction and review any available intelligence information. To the maximum extent possible, BIS will make licensing decisions without referral of license applications to other agencies, however, BIS may consult with other U.S. departments and agencies regarding any license application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review by other departments or agencies. (1) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted under the EAR. In addition, BIS may, where appropriate, refer license applications to other U.S. government departments or agencies. These agencies and departments will be referred to as ``agencies'' for the purposes of this part. Though these agencies have the authority to review any license application, they may determine that they do not need to review certain types of license applications. In these instances, the agency will provide BIS with a Delegation of Authority to process those license applications without review by that particular agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted under the EAR.
