(1) The sulfur content must not be greater than 10 ppm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The DFE or other oxygenate must be composed solely of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of DFE, only previously certified gasoline (including previously certified blendstocks for oxygenate blending), gasoline blendstocks, or natural gas liquids may be used as denaturants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The concentration of all denaturants used in DFE is limited to a maximum of 3.0 volume percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Registration. Unless registered under Sec. 80.1450, the producer or importer of DFE or other oxygenate must register with EPA pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 80.1650.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> PTDs.

Every batch of oxygenate produced or imported at oxygenate production or import facility shall be assigned a number (the ``batch number''), consisting of the EPA-assigned oxygenate producer or importer registration number, the EPA facility registration number, the last two digits of the year in which the batch was produced, and a unique number for the batch, beginning with the number one for the first batch produced or imported each calendar year and each subsequent batch during the calendar year being assigned the next sequential number (e.g., 4321-54321-95-000001, 4321-54321-95-000002, etc.).
