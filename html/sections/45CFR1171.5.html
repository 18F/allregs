Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. The NEH has no obligation to answer questions posed as FOIA requests or to create records to satisfy a FOIA request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agreement to pay fees. If you make a FOIA request, the NEH will consider it an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under this part, subject to the fee limitations of Sec. 1171.11(d).
