                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice. If a debtor's response to the demand letter does not result in payment in full, payment by offset, or payment in accordance with a voluntary repayment agreement or other repayment schedule acceptable to the Benefits Administrator, and the debtor's rights under Sec. 29.512 through Sec. 29.514 have been exhausted, the Benefits Administrator must report the debtor to a credit bureau. In addition, a debtor's failure to make subsequent payments in accordance with a repayment schedule must result in a report to a credit bureau. Before making a report to a credit bureau, the Benefits Administrator must notify the debtor in writing that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The payment is overdue;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Benefits Administrator intends, after 60 days, to make a report as described in paragraph (b) of this section to a credit bureau;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The debtor's right to dispute the liability has been exhausted under Sec. 29.512 through Sec. 29.514; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The debtor may avoid having the Benefits Administrator report the debtor to a credit bureau by paying the debt in one lump sum or making payments current under a repayment schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Report. If, after being sent the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, the debtor does not pay the overpayment debt or make payments current under a repayment schedule or fails to respond to the notice, and 60 days have elapsed since the notice was mailed, the Benefits Administrator will report to a credit bureau that the debtor is responsible for an unpaid debt and provide the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The debtor's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount, status, and history of the debt; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fact that the debt arose in connection with the administration of Federal Benefit Payments under a District Retirement Fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subsequent reports. The Benefits Administrator must update its report to the credit bureau whenever it has knowledge of events that substantially change the status or the amount of the liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other reporting of delinquent debts. Pursuant to 31 CFR 901.4, delinquent overpayment debts should be reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Privacy Act considerations. A delinquent debt may not be reported under this section unless a notice issued pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4), authorizes the disclosure of information about the debtor to a credit bureau or CAIVRS.</p>
