                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When applicable. Whenever the Commissioner, or delegate,  determines that a practitioner is described in paragraph (b) of this  section, the expedited procedures described in this section may be used  to suspend the practitioner from practice before the Internal Revenue  Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To whom applicable. This section applies to any practitioner  who, within 5 years prior to the date that a show   cause order under this section's expedited suspension procedures is  served:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has had a license to practice as an attorney, certified public  accountant, or actuary suspended or revoked for cause (not including  failure to pay a professional licensing fee) by any authority or court,  agency, body, or board described in Sec. 10.51(a)(10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has, irrespective of whether an appeal has been taken, been  convicted of any crime under title 26 of the United States Code, any  crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or any felony for which  the conduct involved renders the practitioner unfit to practice before  the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has violated conditions imposed on the practitioner pursuant to  Sec. 10.79(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has been sanctioned by a court of competent jurisdiction,  whether in a civil or criminal proceeding (including suits for  injunctive relief), relating to any taxpayer's tax liability or relating  to the practitioner's own tax liability, for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Instituting or maintaining proceedings primarily for delay;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Advancing frivolous or groundless arguments; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Failing to pursue available administrative remedies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has demonstrated a pattern of willful disreputable conduct by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Failing to make an annual Federal tax return, in violation of  the Federal tax laws, during 4 of the 5 tax years immediately preceding  the institution of a proceeding under paragraph (c) of this section and  remains noncompliant with any of the practitioner's Federal tax filing  obligations at the time the notice of suspension is issued under  paragraph (f) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failing to make a return required more frequently than  annually, in violation of the Federal tax laws, during 5 of the 7 tax  periods immediately preceding the institution of a proceeding under  paragraph (c) of this section and remains noncompliant with any of the  practitioner's Federal tax filing obligations at the time the notice of  suspension is issued under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Expedited suspension procedures. A suspension under this section  will be proposed by a show cause order that names the respondent, is  signed by an authorized representative of the Internal Revenue Service  under Sec. 10.69(a)(1), and served according to the rules set forth in  Sec. 10.63(a). The show cause order must give a plain and concise  description of the allegations that constitute the basis for the  proposed suspension. The show cause order must notify the respondent--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Of the place and due date for filing a response;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That an expedited suspension decision by default may be rendered  if the respondent fails to file a response as required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the respondent may request a conference to address the  merits of the show cause order and that any such request must be made in  the response; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That the respondent may be suspended either immediately  following the expiration of the period within which a response must be  filed or, if a conference is requested, immediately following the  conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Response. The response to the show cause order described in this  section must be filed no later than 30 calendar days following the date  the show cause order is served, unless the time for filing is extended.  The response must be filed in accordance with the rules set forth for  answers to a complaint in Sec. 10.64, except as otherwise provided in  this section. The response must include a request for a conference, if a  conference is desired. The respondent is entitled to the conference only  if the request is made in a timely filed response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conference. An authorized representative of the Internal Revenue  Service will preside at a conference described in this section. The  conference will be held at a place and time selected by the Internal  Revenue Service, but no sooner than 14 calendar days after the date by  which the response must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service,  unless the respondent agrees to an earlier date. An authorized  representative may represent the respondent at the conference.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Suspension--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Commissioner, or delegate, may  suspend the respondent from practice before the Internal Revenue Service  by a written notice of expedited suspension immediately following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The expiration of the period within which a response to a show  cause order must be filed if the respondent does not file a response as  required by paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The conference described in paragraph (e) of this section if  the Internal Revenue Service finds that the respondent is described in  paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The respondent's failure to appear, either personally or  through an authorized representative, at a conference scheduled by the  Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duration of suspension. A suspension under this section will  commence on the date that the written notice of expedited suspension is  served on the practitioner, either personally or through an authorized  representative. The suspension will remain effective until the earlier  of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date the Internal Revenue Service lifts the suspension after  determining that the practitioner is no longer described in paragraph  (b) of this section or for any other reason; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the suspension is lifted or otherwise modified by an  Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate  deciding appeals, in a proceeding referred to in paragraph (g) of this  section and instituted under Sec. 10.60.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> within 60 calendar days of  receiving the demand. If the Internal Revenue Service does not issue  such complaint within 60 days of receiving the demand, the suspension is  lifted automatically. The preceding sentence does not, however, preclude  the Commissioner, or delegate, from instituting a regular proceeding  under Sec. 10.60 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is generally  applicable beginning June 12, 2014, except that paragraphs (b)(1)  through (4) of this section are applicable beginning August 2, 2011.
