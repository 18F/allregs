                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Rural Growth Factor (RGF) is equal to the sum of the annual percentage change in the United States Department of Commerce's Gross Domestic Product--Chained Price Index (GPD-CPI) plus the percentage change in the total number of rural incumbent

local exchange carrier working loops during the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing submitted pursuant to Sec. 54.1305. The percentage change in total rural incumbent local exchange carrier working loops shall be based upon the difference between the total number of rural incumbent local exchange carrier working loops on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing and the total number of rural incumbent local exchange carrier working loops on December 31 of the second calendar year preceding that filing, both determined by the company's submissions pursuant to Sec. 54.1305. Loops acquired by rural incumbent local exchange carriers shall not be included in the RGF calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beginning July 31, 2012, pursuant to Sec. 54.1301(a), the calculation of the Rural Growth Factor shall not include price cap carrier working loops and rate-of-return local exchange carrier working loops of companies that were affiliated with price cap carriers during the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing submitted pursuant to Sec. 54.1305.</p>
