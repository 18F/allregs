Where:
Ss = corrected stopping distance in metersVs = specified vehicle test speed in km/hSa = actual stopping distance in metersVa = actual vehicle test speed in km/h</p><p class="depth0">Note to S5.3.1(b):</p><p class="depth0">This equation is only valid when the actual test speed (Va) is within 5 km/h of the specified test speed (Vs).</p><p class="depth0">S5.3.2 Continuous deceleration recording. The other method used to measure

performance is the continuous recording of the vehicle instantaneous deceleration from the moment a force is applied to the brake control until the end of the stop.</p><p class="depth0">S6. Test conditions, procedures and performance requirements.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1 General.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.1 Test surfaces.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.1.1 High friction surface. A high friction surface is used for all dynamic brake tests excluding the ABS tests where a low-friction surface is specified. The high-friction surface test area is a clean, dry and level surface, with a gradient of <=1 percent. The high-friction surface has a peak braking coefficient (PBC) of 0.9.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.1.2 Low-friction surface. A low-friction surface is used for ABS tests where a low-friction surface is specified. The low-friction surface test area is a clean and level surface, which may be wet or dry, with a gradient of <=1 percent. The low-friction surface has a PBC of <=0.45.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.1.3 Measurement of PBC. The PBC is measured using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E1136-93 (Reapproved 2003) standard reference test tire, in accordance with ASTM Method E1337-90 (Reapproved 2008), at a speed of 64 km/h (both publications incorporated by reference; see Sec. 571.5).</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.1.4 Parking brake system tests. The specified test slope has a clean and dry surface that does not deform under the weight of the motorcycle.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.1.5 Test lane width. For two-wheeled motorcycles (motorcycle categories 3-1 and 3-3) the test lane width is 2.5 meters. For three-wheeled motorcycles (motorcycle categories 3-2, 3-4 and 3-5) the test lane width is 2.5 meters plus the vehicle width.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.2 Ambient temperature. The ambient temperature is between 4 [deg]C and 45 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.3 Wind speed. The wind speed is not more than 5 meters per second (m/s).</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.4 Test speed tolerance. The test speed tolerance is 5 km/h. In the event of the actual test speed deviating from the specified test speed (but within the 5 km/h tolerance), the actual stopping distance is corrected using the formula in S5.3.1(b).</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.5 Automatic transmission. Motorcycles with automatic transmission shall meet all test requirements--whether they are for ``engine connected'' or ``engine disconnected.'' If an automatic transmission has a neutral position, the neutral position is selected for tests where ``engine disconnected'' is specified.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.6 Vehicle position and wheel lock. The vehicle is positioned in the center of the test lane for the beginning of each stop. Stops are made without the vehicle wheels passing outside the applicable test lane and without wheel lock.</p><p class="depth0">S6.1.7 Test sequence. Test sequence is as specified in Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2 Preparation.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.1 Engine idle speed. The engine idle speed is set to the manufacturer's specification.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.2 Tire pressures. The tires are inflated to the manufacturer's specification for the vehicle loading condition for the test.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.3 Control application points and direction. For a hand control lever, the input force (F) is applied on the control lever's forward surface perpendicular to the axis of the lever fulcrum and its outermost point on the plane along which the control lever rotates (see Figure 1). The input force is applied to a point located 50 millimeters (mm) from the outermost point of the control lever, measured along the axis between the central axis of the fulcrum of the lever and its outermost point. For a foot control pedal, the input force is applied to the center of, and at right angles to, the control pedal.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.4 Brake temperature measurement. The brake temperature is measured on the approximate center of the facing length and width of the most heavily loaded shoe or disc pad, one per brake, using a plug-type thermocouple that is embedded in the friction material, as shown in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth0">S6.2.5 Burnishing procedure.

Make six stops from 30 m.p.h. and then six stops from 60 m.p.h. with an initial brake temperature between 130 [deg]F. and 150 [deg]F. Repeat for each subsystem. Determine that the brake failure indicator is operating when the master cylinder fluid level is less than the level specified in S5.1.3.1(a)(2), and that it complies with S5.1.3.1(c). Check for proper operation with each reservoir in turn at a low level. Restore the service brake system to normal at completion of this test.</p><p class="depth0">S7.9 Parking brake test. Starting with an initial brake temperature of

not more than 150 [deg]F., drive the motorcycle downhill on the 30 percent grade with the longitudinal axis of the motorcycle in the direction of the grade. Apply the service brakes with a force not exceeding 90 pounds to stop the motorcycle and place the transmission in neutral. Apply the parking brake by exerting a force not exceeding those specified in S5.6. Release the service brake and allow the motorcycle to remain at rest (to the limit of traction of the braked wheels) for 5 minutes. Repeat the test with the motorcycle parked in the reversed (uphill) position on the grade.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10 Service brake system--water recovery test.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10.1 Baseline check stops. Make three stops from 30 m.p.h. at 10 to 11 f.p.s.p.s. for each stop. Compute the average of the maximum brake pedal forces and of the maximum brake lever forces required for the three stops.</p><p class="depth0">S7.10.2 Wet brake recovery stops. Completely immerse the rear brake assembly of the motorcycle in water for 2 minutes with the brake fully released. Next completely immerse the front brake assembly of the motorcycle in water for 2 minutes with the brake fully released. Perform the entire wetting procedure in not more than 7 minutes. Immediately after removal of the front brake from water, accelerate at a maximum rate to 30 mi/h without a brake application. Immediately upon reaching that speed make five stops, each from 30 mi/h at 10 to 11 ft/s\2\ for each stop.
