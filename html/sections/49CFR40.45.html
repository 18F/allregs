                                Sec. 40.45  What form is used to document a DOT urine collection?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) must be  used to document every urine collection required by the DOT drug testing  program. You may view this form on the Department's Web site(http:// www.dot.gov/odapc) or the HHS Web site (http:// www.workplace.samhsa.gov).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must not use a non-Federal form or an expired CCF to conduct  a DOT urine collection. As a laboratory, C/TPA or other party that  provides CCFs to employers, collection sites, or other customers, you  must not provide copies of an expired CCF to these participants. You  must also affirmatively notify these participants that they must not use  an expired CCF (e.g., that after November 30, 2011, they must not use an  expired CCF for DOT urine collections).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As a participant in the DOT drug testing program, you are not  permitted to modify or revise the CCF except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may include, in the area outside the border of the form,  other information needed for billing or other purposes necessary to the  collection process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CCF must include the names, addresses, telephone numbers and  fax numbers of the employer and the MRO, which may be preprinted, typed,  or handwritten. The MRO information must include the specific  physician's name and address, as opposed to only a   generic clinic, health care organization, or company name. This  information is required, and it is prohibited for an employer,  collector, service agent or any other party to omit it. In addition, a  C/TPA's name, address, fax number, and telephone number may be included,  but is not required. The employer may use a C/TPA's address in place of  its own, but must continue to include its name, telephone number, and  fax number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an employer, in Step 1-D of the CCF you may preprint the box  for the DOT Agency under whose authority the test will occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As a collector, you may use a CCF with your name, address,  telephone number, and fax number preprinted, but under no circumstances  may you sign the form before the collection event.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When using an electronic CCF, you must establish adequate  confidentialityand security measures to ensure that confidential  employee records are not available to unauthorized persons. This  includes protecting the physical security of records, access controls,  and computer security measures to safeguard confidential data in  electronic form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Under no circumstances may the CCF transmit personal identifying  information about an employee (other than a social security number (SSN)  or other employee identification (ID) number) to a laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> As an employer, you may use an equivalent foreign-language  version of the CCF approved by ODAPC. You may use such a non-English  language form only in a situation where both the employee and collector  understand and can use the form in that language.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An employer who uses an electronic CCF must ensure that the  collection site, the primary and split laboratories, and MRO have  compatible systems, and that the employee and any other program  participants in the testing process will receive a legible copy of the  CCF.
