The analysis must account for,  at a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All trajectory times from liftoff to the planned safe flight  state of Sec. 417.219(c), including each planned impact, for an orbital  launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Regions of land potentially exposed to debris resulting from  normal flight events and events resulting from any potential  malfunction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Regions of sea and air potentially exposed to debris from normal  flight events, including planned impacts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the vicinity of the launch site, any waterborne vessels,  populated offshore structures, or aircraft exposed to debris from events  resulting from any potential abnormal flight events, including launch  vehicle malfunction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any operational controls implemented to control risk to the  public from debris hazards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Debris identified by the debris analysis of Sec. 417.211; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All launch vehicle trajectory dispersion effects in the surface  impact domain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public notices. A flight hazard areas analysis must establish  the ship hazard areas for notices to mariners that encompass the three- sigma impact dispersion area for each planned debris impact. A flight  hazard areas analysis must establish the aircraft hazard areas for  notices to airmen that encompass the 3-sigma impact dispersion volume  for each planned debris impact. Section 417.121(e) contains procedural  requirements for issuing notices to mariners and airmen.</p>
