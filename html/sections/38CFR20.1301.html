                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. It is the policy of the Board of Veterans' Appeals for  the full text of appellate decisions, Statements of the Case, and  Supplemental Statements of the Case to be disclosed to appellants. In  those situations where disclosing certain information directly to the  appellant would not be in conformance with 38 U.S.C. 5701, that  information will be removed from the decision, Statement of the Case, or  Supplemental Statement of the Case and the remaining text will be  furnished to the appellant. A full-text appellate decision, Statement of  the Case, or Supplemental Statement of the Case will be disclosed to the  designated representative, however, unless the relationship between the  appellant and representative is such (for example, a parent or spouse)  that disclosure to the representative would be as harmful as if made to  the appellant.

All personal identifiers are  redacted from the decisions prior to publication. Specific decisions may  be identified by a word and/or topic search, or by the Board docket  number.
