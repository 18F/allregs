                            <p class="depth0">As promptly as possible after the time allowed for presenting  proposed findings and conclusions, the administrative law judge will  make findings of fact and conclusions of law, unless waiver has been  stipulated, and will   render a decision upon all issues of material fact and law presented on  the record. In doing so, he or she may adopt the findings of fact and  conclusions of law proposed by one or more of the parties if they are  correct. The reasons for the findings, conclusions, and decision made  will be stated, and along with the findings, conclusions, and decision,  will become a part of the record in any further appeal. A copy of the  decision must be sent by certified mail to all the parties.  [75 FR 64669, Oct. 20, 2010]</p>
