                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each certificate holder operating a reciprocating engine powered  large transport category airplane shall comply with Sec. Sec. 135.365  through 135.377.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each certificate holder operating a turbine engine powered large  transport category airplane shall comply with Sec. Sec. 135.379 through  135.387, except that when it operates a turbopropeller-powered large  transport category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959, but  previously type certificated with the same number of reciprocating  engines, it may comply with Sec. Sec. 135.365 through 135.377.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each certificate holder operating a large nontransport category  airplane shall comply with Sec. Sec. 135.389 through 135.395 and any  determination of compliance must be based only on approved performance  data. For the purpose of this subpart, a large nontrans- port category  airplane is an airplane that was type certificated before July 1, 1942.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each certificate holder operating a small transport category  airplane shall comply with Sec. 135.397.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each certificate holder operating a small nontransport category  airplane shall comply with Sec. 135.399.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The performance data in the Airplane Flight Manual applies in  determining compliance with Sec. Sec. 135.365 through 135.387. Where  conditions are different from those on which the performance data is  based, compliance is determined by interpolation or by computing the  effects of change in the specific variables, if the results of the  interpolation or computations are substantially as accurate as the  results of direct tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large  transport category airplane at a weight that is more than the allowable  weight for the runway being used (determined under the runway takeoff  limitations of the transport category operating rules of this subpart)  after taking into account the temperature operating correction factors  in section 4a.749a-T or section 4b.117 of the Civil Air Regulations in  effect on January 31, 1965, and in the applicable Airplane Flight  Manual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Administrator may author- ize in the operations  specifications deviations from this subpart if special circumstances  make a literal observ-   ance of a requirement unnecessary for safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The 10-mile width specified in Sec. Sec. 135.369 through  135.373 may be reduced to 5 miles, for not more than 20 miles, when  operating under VFR or where navigation facilities furnish reliable and  accurate identification of high ground and obstructions located outside  of 5 miles, but within 10 miles, on each side of the intended track.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Each certificate holder operating a commuter category airplane  shall comply with Sec. 135.398.
