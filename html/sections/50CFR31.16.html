                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Except as hereafter noted, persons trapping animals on wildlife  refuge areas where trapping has been authorized shall secure and comply  with the provisions of a Federal permit issued for that purpose. This  permit shall specify the terms and conditions of trapping activity and  the rates of charge or division of pelts, hides, and carcasses. Lands  acquired as ``waterfowl production areas'' shall be open to public  trapping without Federal permit provided that trapping on all or part of  individual areas may be temporarily suspended by posting upon occasions  of unusual or critical conditions affecting land, water, vegetation, or  wildlife populations. Each person trapping on any wildlife refuge area  shall possess the required State license or permit and shall comply with  the provisions of State laws and regulations.
