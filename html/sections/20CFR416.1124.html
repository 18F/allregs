                                Sec. 416.1124  Unearned income we do not count.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. While we must know the source and amount of all of your  unearned income for SSI, we do not count all of it to determine your  eligibility and benefit amount. We first exclude income as authorized by  other Federal laws (see paragraph (b) of this section). Then we apply  the other exclusions in the order listed in paragraph (c) of this  section to the rest of your unearned income in the month. We never  reduce your unearned income below zero or apply any unused unearned  income exclusion to earned income except for the $20 general exclusion  described in paragraph (c)(12) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other Federal laws. Some Federal laws other than the Social  Security Act provide that we cannot count some of your unearned income  for SSI purposes. We list the laws and the exclusions in the appendix to  this subpart which we update periodically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other unearned income we do not count. We do not count as  unearned income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any public agency's refund of taxes on real property or food;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assistance based on need which is wholly funded by a State or  one of its political subdivisions. (For purposes of this rule, an Indian  tribe is considered a political subdivision of a State.) Assistance is  based on need when it is provided under a program which uses the amount  of your income as one factor to determine your eligibility. Assistance  based on need includes State supplementation of Federal SSI benefits as  defined in subpart T of this part but does not include payments under a  Federal/State grant program such as Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families under title IV-A of the Social Security Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any portion of a grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift used or  set aside for paying tuition, fees, or other necessary educational  expenses. However, we do count any portion set aside or actually used  for food or shelter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Food which you or your spouse raise if it is consumed by you or  your household;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assistance received under the Disaster Relief and Emergency  Assistance Act and assistance provided under any Federal statute because  of a catastrophe which the President of the United States declares to be  a major disaster. See Sec. 416.1150 for a more detailed discussion of  this assistance, particularly the treatment of in-kind support and  maintenance received as the result of a major disaster;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The first $60 of unearned income received in a calendar quarter  if you receive it infrequently or irregularly. We consider income to be  received infrequently if you receive it only once during a calendar  quarter from a single source and you did not receive it in the month  immediately preceding that month or in the month immediately subsequent  to that month. We consider income to be received irregularly if you  cannot reasonably expect to receive it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Alaska Longevity Bonus payments made to an individual who is a  resident of Alaska and who, prior to October 1, 1985: met the 25-year  residency requirement for receipt of such payments in effect prior to  January 1, 1983; and was eligible for SSI;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Payments for providing foster care to an ineligible child who  was placed in your home by a public or private nonprofit child placement  or child care agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any interest earned on excluded burial funds and any  appreciation in the value of an excluded burial arrangement which are  left to accumulate and become a part of the separate burial fund. (See  Sec. 416.1231 for an explanation of the exclusion of burial assets.)  This exclusion from income applies to interest earned on burial funds or  appreciation in the value of excluded burial arrangements which occur  beginning November 1, 1982, or the date you first become eligible for  SSI benefits, if later;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Certain support and maintenance assistance as described in  Sec. 416.1157;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> One-third of support payments made to or for you by an absent  parent if you are a child;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The first $20 of any unearned income in a month other than  income in the form of in-kind support and maintenance received in the  household of another (see Sec. 416.1131) and income based on need.  Income based on need is a benefit that uses financial need as   measured by your income as a factor to determine your eligibility. The  $20 exclusion does not apply to a benefit based on need that is totally  or partially funded by the Federal government or by a nongovernmental  agency. However, assistance which is based on need and funded wholly by  a State or one of its political subdivisions is excluded totally from  income as described in Sec. 416.1124(c)(2). If you have less than $20 of  unearned income in a month and you have earned income in that month, we  will use the rest of the $20 exclusion to reduce the amount of your  countable earned income;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Any unearned income you receive and use to fulfill an approved  plan to achieve self-support if you are blind or disabled and under age  65 or blind or disabled and received SSI as a blind or disabled person  for the month before you reached age 65. See Secs. 416.1180 through  416.1182 for an explanation of plans to achieve self-support and for the  rules on when this exclusion applies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The value of any assistance paid with respect to a dwelling  unit under--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The United States Housing Act of 1937;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The National Housing Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Title V of the Housing Act of 1949; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Section 202(h) of the Housing Act of 1959;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Any interest accrued on and left to accumulate as part of the  value of an excluded burial space purchase agreement. This exclusion  from income applies to interest accrued on or after April 1, 1990;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The value of any commercial transportation ticket, for travel  by you or your spouse among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,  and the Northern Mariana Islands, which is received as a gift by you or  your spouse and is not converted to cash. If such a ticket is converted  to cash, the cash you receive is income in the month you receive the  cash;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Payments received by you from a fund established by a State to  aid victims of crime;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Relocation assistance provided you by a State or local  government that is comparable to assistance provided under title II of  the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies  Act of 1970 that is subject to the treatment required by section 216 of  that Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Special pay received from one of the uniformed services  pursuant to 37 U.S.C. 310;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Interest or other earnings on a dedicated account which is  excluded from resources.

We will exclude any in-kind gift that is not converted to  cash and cash gifts to the extent that the total gifts excluded pursuant  to this paragraph do not exceed $2000 in any calendar year. In-kind  gifts converted to cash are considered under income counting rules in  the month of conversion;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Interest and dividend income from a countable resource or from  a resource excluded under a Federal statute other than section 1613(a)  of the Social Security Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(23)</em> AmeriCorps State and National and AmeriCorps National Civilian  Community Corps cash or in-kind payments to AmeriCorps participants or  on AmeriCorps participants' behalf. These include, but are not limited  to: Food and shelter, and clothing allowances;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(24)</em> Any annuity paid by a State to a person (or his or her spouse)  based on the State's determination that the person is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A veteran (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Blind, disabled, or aged.
