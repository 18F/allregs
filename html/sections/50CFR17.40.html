The baseline population of these lands is determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Take on properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands is restricted to prairie dogs in excess of the baseline population. The baseline population is the highest estimated total (summer) population size on that property during the 5 years prior to the establishment of the conservation property, except that if no UDWR surveys to determine population size on a property were conducted during such 5-year period, the baseline population is the estimated total (summer) population size on that property as determined in the first survey conducted after the establishment of the conservation property. The baseline population will be established by the UDWR, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Translocated Utah prairie dogs will count toward the take limits in paragraphs (g)(3)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Methods of allowed direct take on agricultural lands and private properties near conservation land. Methods for controlling Utah prairie dogs on agricultural lands and properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands are limited to activities associated with translocation efforts by trained and permitted individuals complying with current Service-approved guidance, trapping intended for lethal removal, and shooting. Actions intended to drown or poison Utah prairie dogs and the use of gas cartridges, anticoagulants, and explosive devices are prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Human safety hazards and significant human cultural or human burial sites. (i) Nonlethal take is allowed where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, if approved in writing by the Service. To reduce hazards, prairie dog burrows may be filled with dirt if they are directly creating human hazards or disturbing the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites. Utah prairie dogs also may be translocated from these sites to approved translocation sites by properly trained personnel using Service-approved translocation protocols.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Nonlethal take is allowed where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, if approved in writing by the Service. To reduce hazards, prairie dog burrows may be filled with dirt if they are directly creating human hazards or disturbing the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites. Utah prairie dogs also may be translocated from these sites to approved translocation sites by properly trained personnel using Service-approved translocation protocols.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Direct or intentional lethal take is allowed where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, but only after all practicable measures to resolve the conflict are implemented, and only as approved in writing by the Service. A permit is not required to allow take under these conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All practicable measures means, with respect to these situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Construction of prairie-dog-proof fence, above and below grade to specifications approved by the Service, around the area in which there is concern.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Translocation of Utah prairie dogs out of the fenced area in which there is a concern must be conducted prior to allowing lethal take. Lethal take is allowed only to remove prairie dogs that remain in these areas after the measures to fence and translocate are successfully carried out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Continued maintenance or modification of the fence as needed to preclude Utah prairie dogs from entering the fenced sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> There are no restrictions on the amount, timing, or methods of lethal take allowed on lands where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, as long as all qualifications in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(A)(1)through (3) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount of take in areas where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites does not contribute to the upper permitted take limits described above for agricultural lands and private properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Incidental take associated with agriculture. Utah prairie dogs may be taken when take is incidental to otherwise-legal activities associated with legal and standard agricultural practices on legitimately operating agricultural lands. Acceptable practices include plowing to depths that do not exceed 46 cm (18 in.), discing, harrowing, irrigating crops, mowing, harvesting, and bailing, as long as the activities are not intended to eradicate Utah prairie dogs. There is no numeric limit established for incidental take associated with standard agricultural practices. Incidental take is in addition to, and does not contribute to, the take limits described in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4) of this section. A permit is not required for incidental take associated with agricultural practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the Service receives evidence that take pursuant to paragraphs (g)(2) through (5) of this section is having an effect that is inconsistent with the conservation of the Utah prairie dog, the Service may immediately prohibit or restrict such take as appropriate for the conservation of the species. The Service will notify the permitting entities in writing if take restrictions are necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Mountain lion (Felis concolor).
