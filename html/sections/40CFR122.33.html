                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you operate a regulated small MS4 under Sec. 122.32, you must seek coverage under a NPDES permit issued by your NPDES permitting authority. If you are located in an NPDES authorized State, Tribe, or Territory, then that State, Tribe, or Territory is your NPDES permitting authority. Otherwise, your NPDES permitting authority is the EPA Regional Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must seek authorization to discharge under a general or individual NPDES permit, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If your NPDES permitting authority has issued a general permit applicable to your discharge and you are seeking coverage under the general permit, you must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) that includes the information on your best management practices and measurable goals required by Sec. 122.34(d). You may file your own NOI, or you and other municipalities or governmental entities may jointly submit an NOI. If you want to share responsibilities for meeting the minimum measures with other municipalities or governmental entities, you must submit an NOI that describes which minimum measures you will implement and identify the entities that will implement the other minimum measures within the area served by your MS4. The general permit will explain any other steps necessary to obtain permit authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> If you are seeking authorization to discharge under an individual permit and wish to implement a program under Sec. 122.34, you must submit an application to your NPDES permitting authority that includes the information required under Sec. Sec. 122.21(f) and 122.34(d), an estimate of square mileage served by your small MS4, and any additional information that your NPDES permitting authority requests. A storm sewer map that satisfies the requirement of Sec. 122.34(b)(3)(i) will satisfy the map requirement in Sec. 122.21(f)(7).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you are seeking authorization to discharge under an individual permit and wish to implement a program under Sec. 122.34, you must submit an application to your NPDES permitting authority that includes the information required under Sec. Sec. 122.21(f) and 122.34(d), an estimate of square mileage served by your small MS4, and any additional information that your NPDES permitting authority requests. A storm sewer map that satisfies the requirement of Sec. 122.34(b)(3)(i) will satisfy the map requirement in Sec. 122.21(f)(7).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you are seeking authorization to discharge under an individual permit and wish to implement a program that is different from the program under Sec. 122.34, you will need to comply with the permit application requirements of Sec. 122.26(d). You must submit both Parts of the application requirements in Sec. Sec. 122.26(d)(1) and (2) by March 10, 2003. You do not need to submit the information required by Sec. Sec. 122.26(d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) regarding

your legal authority, unless you intend for the permit writer to take such information into account when developing your other permit conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If allowed by your NPDES permitting authority, you and another regulated entity may jointly apply under either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section to be co-permittees under an individual permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If your small MS4 is in the same urbanized area as a medium or large MS4 with an NPDES storm water permit and that other MS4 is willing to have you participate in its storm water program, you and the other MS4 may jointly seek a modification of the other MS4 permit to include you as a limited co-permittee. As a limited co-permittee, you will be responsible for compliance with the permit's conditions applicable to your jurisdiction. If you choose this option you will need to comply with the permit application requirements of Sec. 122.26, rather than the requirements of Sec. 122.34. You do not need to comply with the specific application requirements of Sec. 122.26(d)(1)(iii) and (iv) and (d)(2)(iii) (discharge characterization). You may satisfy the requirements in Sec. 122.26 (d)(1)(v) and (d)(2)(iv) (identification of a management program) by referring to the other MS4's storm water management program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guidance: In referencing an MS4's storm water management program, you should briefly describe how the existing plan will address discharges from your small MS4 or would need to be supplemented in order to adequately address your discharges. You should also explain your role in coordinating storm water pollutant control activities in your MS4, and detail the resources available to you to accomplish the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you operate a regulated small MS4:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designated under Sec. 122.32(a)(1), you must apply for coverage under an NPDES permit, or apply for a modification of an existing NPDES permit under paragraph (b)(3) of this section by March 10, 2003, unless your MS4 serves a jurisdiction with a population under 10,000 and the NPDES permitting authority has established a phasing schedule under Sec. 123.35(d)(3) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Designated under Sec. 122.32(a)(2), you must apply for coverage under an NPDES permit, or apply for a modification of an existing NPDES permit under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, within 180 days of notice, unless the NPDES permitting authority grants a later date.
