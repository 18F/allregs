                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The metropolitan transportation planning process shall be continuous, cooperative, and comprehensive, and provide for consideration and implementation of projects, strategies, and services that will address the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area, especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Increase the safety of the transportation system for motorized and non-motorized users;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Increase the security of the transportation system for motorized and non-motorized users;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Increase accessibility and mobility of people and freight;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and State and local planned growth and economic development patterns;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation system, across and between modes, for people and freight;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Promote efficient system management and operation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consideration of the planning factors in paragraph (a) of this section shall be reflected, as appropriate, in the metropolitan transportation planning process. The degree of consideration and analysis of the factors should be based on the scale and complexity of many issues, including transportation system development, land use, employment, economic development, human and natural environment, and housing and community development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The failure to consider any factor specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be reviewable by any court under title 23 U.S.C., 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, subchapter II of title 5, U.S.C. Chapter 5, or title 5 U.S.C. Chapter 7 in any matter affecting a metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, a project or strategy, or the certification of a metropolitan transportation planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The metropolitan transportation planning process shall be carried out in coordination with the statewide transportation planning process required by 23 U.S.C. 135 and 49 U.S.C. 5304.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In carrying out the metropolitan transportation planning process,

MPOs, States, and public transportation operators may apply asset management principles and techniques in establishing planning goals, defining TIP priorities, and assessing transportation investment decisions, including transportation system safety, operations, preservation, and maintenance, as well as strategies and policies to support homeland security and to safeguard the personal security of all motorized and non-motorized users.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The metropolitan transportation planning process shall (to the maximum extent practicable) be consistent with the development of applicable regional intelligent transportation systems (ITS) architectures, as defined in 23 CFR part 940.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Preparation of the coordinated public transit-human services transportation plan, as required by 49 U.S.C. 5310, 5316, and 5317, should be coordinated and consistent with the metropolitan transportation planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The metropolitan transportation planning process should be consistent with the Strategic Highway Safety Plan, as specified in 23 U.S.C. 148, and other transit safety and security planning and review processes, plans, and programs, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The FHWA and the FTA shall designate as a transportation management area (TMA) each urbanized area with a population of over 200,000 individuals, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. The FHWA and the FTA shall also designate any additional urbanized area as a TMA on the request of the Governor and the MPO designated for that area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In an urbanized area not designated as a TMA that is an air quality attainment area, the MPO(s) may propose and submit to the FHWA and the FTA for approval a procedure for developing an abbreviated metropolitan transportation plan and TIP. In developing proposed simplified planning procedures, consideration shall be given to whether the abbreviated metropolitan transportation plan and TIP will achieve the purposes of 23 U.S.C. 134, 49 U.S.C. 5303, and these regulations, taking into account the complexity of the transportation problems in the area. The simplified procedures shall be developed by the MPO in cooperation with the State(s) and public transportation operator(s).</p>
