                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of leave of absence. The purpose of the leave system is to enable the child to maintain his or her status as an active program participant.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for leave of absence. The VR&E; case manager may grant the child leaves of absence for periods during which the child fails to pursue a vocational training program. For prolonged periods of absence, the VR&E; case manager may approve leaves of absence only if the case manager determines the child is unable to pursue a vocational training program through no fault of the child.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect on entitlement. During a leave of absence, VA suspends the running of the basic 24-month period of entitlement, plus any extensions thereto, until the child resumes the program.
