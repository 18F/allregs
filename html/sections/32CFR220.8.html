                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 1095(f) and section 1097b(b) both  address the issue of computation of rates. Between them, the effect is  to authorize the calculation of all third party payer collections on the  basis of reasonable charges and the computation of reasonable charges on  the basis of per diem rates, all-inclusive per-visit rates, diagnosis  related groups rates, rates used by the Civilian Health and Medical  Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) program to reimburse  authorized providers, or any other method the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Health Affairs) considers appropriate and establishes in this  part. Such rates, representative of costs, are also endorsed by section  1079(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The general rule is that reasonable charges under this part are  based on the rates used by CHAMPUS under 32 CFR 199.14 to reimburse  authorized providers. There are some exceptions to this general rule, as  outlined in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, the method in effect prior to April 1,  2003 (described in paragraph (c) of this section), may continue to be  used for a period of time after April 1, 2003, if the Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) determines that effective  implementation requires a temporary deferral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inpatient hospital and inpatient professional services before  April 1, 2003--(1) In general. Prior to April 1, 2003, the computation  of reasonable charges for inpatient hospital and professional services  is reasonable costs based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Costs  shall be based on the inpatient full reimbursement rate per hospital  discharge, weighted to reflect the intensity of the principal diagnosis  involved. The average charge per case shall be published annually as an  inpatient standardized amount. A relative weight for each DRG shall be  the same as the DRG weights published annually for hospital  reimbursement rates under CHAMPUS pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. The  method in effect prior to April 1, 2003 (as described in this paragraph  (c)), may continue to be used for a period of time after April 1, 2003,  if the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) determines that  effective implementation requires a temporary deferral of the method  described in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Standard amount. The standard amount is determined by dividing  the total costs of all inpatient care in all military treatment  facilities by the total number of discharges. This produces a single  national standardized amount. The Department of Defense is authorized,  but not required by this part, to calculate three standardized amounts,  one for large urban, other urban/rural, and overseas area, utilizing the  same distinctions in identifying the first two areas as is used for  CHAMPUS under 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1). Using this applicable standardized  amount, the Department of Defense may make adjustments for area wage  rates and indirect medical education costs (as identified in paragraph  (c)(4) of this section), producing for each inpatient facility of the  Uniformed Services a facility-specific ``adjusted standardized amount''  (ASA).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DRG relative weights. Costs for each DRG will be determined by  multiplying the standardized amount per discharge by the DRG relative  weight. For this purpose, the DRG relative weights used for CHAMPUS  pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1) shall be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adjustments for outliers, area wages, and indirect medical  education. The Department of Defense may, but is not required by this  part, to adjust charge determinations in particular cases for length-of- stay outliers (long stay and short stay), cost outliers, area wage  rates, and indirect medical education. If any such adjustments are used,  the method shall be comparable to that used for CHAMPUS hospital  reimbursements pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E), and the  calculation of the standardized amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this  section will reflect that such adjustments will be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identification of professional and hospital charges. For  purposes of billing third party payers other than automobile liability  and no-fault insurance carriers, inpatient billings are subdivided into  two categories:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Hospital charges (which refers to routine service charges  associated with the hospital stay and ancillary charges).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Professional charges (which refers to professional services  provided by physicians and certain other providers).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Medical services and subsistence charges included. Medical  services charges pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1078 or subsistence charges  pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1075 are included in the claim filed with the  third party payer pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095. For any patient of a  facility of the Uniformed Services who indicates that he or she is a  beneficiary of a third party payer plan, the usual medical services or  subsistence charge will not be collected from the patient to the extent  that payment received from the payer exceeds the medical services or  subsistence charge. Thus, except in cases covered by Sec. 220.8(k),  payment of the claim made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095 which exceeds the  medical services or subsistence charge, will satisfy all of the third  party payer's obligation arising from the inpatient hospital care  provided by the facility of the Uniformed Services on that occasion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reasonable charges for professional services. The CHAMPUS  Maximum Allowable Charge rate table, established under 32 CFR 199.14(h),  is used for determining the appropriate charge for professional services  in an itemized format, based on Healthcare Common Procedure Coding  System (HCPCS) methodology. This applies to outpatient professional  charges only prior to implementation of the method described in  paragraph (b) of this section, and to all professional charges, both  inpatient and outpatient, thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Miscellaneous Healthcare services. Some special services are  provided by or through facilities of the Uniformed Services for which  reasonable charges are computed based on reasonable costs. Those  services are the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The charge for ambulance services is based on the full costs of  operating the ambulance service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to inpatient hospital charges in the Burn Center at  Brooke Army Medical Center, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs may establish an adjustment to the rate otherwise  applicable under the DRG payment methodology under this section to  reflect unique attributes of the Burn Center.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Charges for dental services (including oral diagnosis and  prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed and removable),  implantology, oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and  endodontics) will be based on a full cost of the dental services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to service provided prior to January 1, 2003,  reasonable charges for anesthesia services will be based on an average  DoD cost of service in all Military Treatment Facilities. With respect  to services provided on or after January 1, 2003, reasonable charges for  anesthesia services will be based on an average cost per minute of  service in all Military Treatment Facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The charge for immunizations, allergin extracts, allergic  condition tests, and the administration of certain medications when  these services are provided in a separate immunizations or shot clinic,  are based on CHAMPUS prevailing rates in cases in which such   rates are available, and in cases in which such rates are not available,  on the average full cost of these services, exclusive of any costs  considered for purposes of any outpatient visit. A separate charge shall  be made for each immunization, injection or medication administered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The charges for pharmacy, durable medical equipment and supplies  are based on CHAMPUS prevailing rates in cases in which such rates are  available, in cases in which such rates are not available, on the  average full cost of these items, exclusive of any costs considered for  purposes of any outpatient visit. A separate charge shall be made for  each item provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Charges for aero-medical evacuation will be based on the full  cost of the aero-medical evacuation services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rule for services ordered and paid for by a facility of  the Uniformed Services but provided by another provider. In cases where  a facility of the Uniformed Services purchases ancillary services or  procedures, from a source other than a Uniformed Services facility, the  cost of the purchased services will be added to the standard rate.  Examples of ancillary services and other procedures covered by this  special rule include (but are not limited to): laboratory, radiology,  pharmacy, pulmonary function, cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis,  hyperbaric medicine, electrocardiography, electroencephalography,  electroneuromyography, pulmonary function, inhalation and respiratory  therapy and physical therapy services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> are considered for purposes of  this part as services provided by the facility of the Uniformed  Services. Thus, third party payers will receive a claim for such  services in the same manner and for the same charges as any similar  services provided by a facility of the Uniformed Services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Alternative determination of reasonable charges. Any third party  payer that can satisfactorily demonstrate a prevailing rate of payment  in the same geographic area for the same or similar aggregate groups of  services that is less than the charges prescribed under this section  may, with the agreement of the facility of the Uniformed Services (or  other authorized representatives of the United States), limit payments  under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to that prevailing rate for those services. The  determination of the third party payer's prevailing rate shall be based  on a review of valid contractual arrangements with other facilities or  providers constituting a majority of the services for which payment is  made under the third party payer's plan. This paragraph does not apply  to cases covered by Sec. 220.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Exception authority for extraordinary circumstances. The  Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may authorize exceptions  to this section, not inconsistent with law, based on extraordinary  circumstances.
