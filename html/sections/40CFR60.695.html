                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart  shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to  manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless  alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that  facility by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where a thermal incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction,  a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder  shall be used to measure the temperature of the gas stream in the  combustion zone of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring device  shall have an accuracy of 1 percent of the  temperature being measured, expressed in [deg]C, or 0.5 [deg]C (0.9 [deg]F), whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a catalytic incinerator is used for VOC emission  reduction, temperature monitoring devices, each equipped with a  continuous recorder shall be used to measure the temperature in the gas  stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed of the incinerator.  The temperature monitoring devices shall have an accuracy of 1 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed  in [deg]C, or 0.5 [deg]C (0.9 [deg]F), whichever  is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a carbon adsorber is used for VOC emissions reduction, a  monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the VOC  concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the  control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be  used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed  directly onsite, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and  records the volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of  organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or  inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the  carbon bed directly onsite in the control device (e.g., a carbon  canister), the concentration level of the organic compounds in the  exhaust vent stream from the carbon adsorption system shall be monitored  on a regular schedule, and the existing carbon shall be replaced with  fresh carbon immediately when carbon breakthrough is indicated. The  device shall be monitored on a daily basis or at intervals no greater  than 20 percent of the design carbon replacement interval, whichever is  greater. As an alternative to   conducting this monitoring, an owner or operator may replace the carbon  in the carbon adsorption system with fresh carbon at a regular  predetermined time interval that is less than the carbon replacement  interval that is determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic  concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a flare is used for VOC emission reduction, the owner or  operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements of 40 CFR  60.18(f)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a VOC recovery device other than a carbon adsorber is used  to meet the requirements specified in Sec. 60.692-5(a), the owner or  operator shall provide to the Administrator information describing the  operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) that would  indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The  Administrator may request further information and will specify  appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An alternative operational or process parameter may be monitored  if it can be demonstrated that another parameter will ensure that the  control device is operated in conformance with these standards and the  control device's design specifications.
