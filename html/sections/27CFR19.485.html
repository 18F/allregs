                                Sec. 19.485  Package identification numbers in production and storage.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A proprietor must mark with a lot identification number  each package of spirits filled during production or storage operations.  The lot identification number must show when the package was filled and  must consist of, in order, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The last two digits of the calendar year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An alphabetical designation for the month from ``A'' through  ``L'', representing, in order, January through December;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Two digits corresponding to the day of the month; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When more than one lot is filled into packages during the same  day, for successive lots after the first lot, a letter suffix sequence  starting with ``A'' representing the second lot, with ``B'' representing  the third lot, and so forth. For example: the first three lots filled  into packages on January 2, 2002, would be identified as ``02A02'',  ``02A02A'', and ``02A02B''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Packages constituting a lot. Packages of spirits, including any  remnant package, received from customs custody or filled during any one  day will receive the same lot identification number, subject to the  following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are of the same type and either are of the same rated  capacity or are uniformly filled with the same quantity by weight or  other measurement method prescribed in Sec. 19.289;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> They are filled with spirits of the same kind and same proof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If they are filled with mingled spirits, the mingling was  conducted in accordance with Sec. 19.326; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of spirits imported or brought into the United  States, they are filled with imported spirits, Puerto Rican spirits or  Virgin Island spirits, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Serial numbers. At the time of filling, receipt on bonded  premises, or withdrawal from bond, the appropriate TTB officer may  require serial numbers on packages of spirits within the same lot in  conjunction with the lot identification number. The proprietor must  assign temporary serial numbers to packages for control purposes when  they are transferred in bond in an unsecured conveyance or gauged after  tampering within the storage account.
