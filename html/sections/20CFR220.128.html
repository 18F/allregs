                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Age refers to how old the claimaint is  (chronological age) and the extent to which his or her age affects his  or her ability to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Adapt to a new work situation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Do work in competition with others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining disability, the Board does not consider age  alone. The Board must also consider the claimant's residual functional  capacity, education, and work experience. If the claimant is unemployed  because of his or her age and can still do a significant number of jobs  which exist in the national economy, the Board will find that he or she  is not disabled. Appendix 2 of this part explains in detail how the  Board considers age as a vocational factor. However, the Board does not  apply these age categories mechanically in a borderline situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Younger person. If the claimant is under age 50, the Board  generally does not consider that his or her age will seriously affect  the ability to adapt to a new work situation. In some circumstances, the  Board considers age 45 a handicap in adapting to a new work setting (see  Rule 201.17 in appendix 2 of this part).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Person approaching advanced age. If the claimant is closely  approaching advanced age (50-54), the Board considers that the  claimant's age, along   with a severe impairment and limited work experience, may seriously  affect the claimant's ability to adjust to a significant number of jobs  in the national economy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Person of advanced age. The Board considers that advanced age  (55 or over) is the point at which age significantly affects the  claimant's ability to do substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the claimant is severly impaired and of advanced age, and he  or she cannot do medium work (see Sec. 220.132), the claimant may not  be able to work unless he or she has skills that can be used in less  demanding jobs which exist in significant numbers in the national  economy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the claimant is close to retirement age (60-64) and has a  severe impairment, the Board will not consider him or her able to adjust  to sedentary or light work unless the claimant has skills which are  highly marketable.</p>
