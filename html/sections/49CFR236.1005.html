(1) Lines required to be equipped. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, each Class I railroad and each railroad providing or hosting intercity or commuter passenger service shall progressively equip its lines as provided in its approved PTCIP such that, on and after December 31, 2015, a PTC system certified under Sec. 236.1015 is installed and operated by the host railroad on each:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Main line over which is transported any quantity of material poisonous by inhalation (PIH), including anhydrous ammonia, as defined in Secs. 171.8, 173.115 and 173.132 of this title;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Main line used for regularly provided intercity or commuter passenger service, except as provided in Sec. 236.1019; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional line of railroad as required by the applicable FRA approved PTCIP, this subpart, or an FRA order requiring installation of a PTC system by that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Initial baseline identification of lines. For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the baseline information necessary to determine whether a Class I railroad's track segment shall be equipped with a PTC system shall be determined and reported as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The traffic density threshold of 5 million gross tons shall be based upon calendar year 2008 gross tonnage, except to the extent that traffic may fall below 5 million gross tons for two consecutive calendar years and a PTCIP or an RFA reflecting this change is filed and approved under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and, if applicable, Sec. 236.1021.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The presence or absence of any quantity of PIH hazardous materials shall be determined by whether one or more cars containing such product(s) was transported over the track segment in calendar year 2008 or prior to the filing of the PTCIP, except to the extent that the PTCIP or RFA justifies, under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, removal of the subject track segment from the PTCIP listing of lines to be equipped.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Addition of track segments. To the extent increases in freight rail traffic occur subsequent to calendar year 2008 that might affect the requirement to install a PTC system on any line not yet equipped, the railroad shall seek to amend its PTCIP by promptly filing an RFA in accordance with Sec. 236.1021. The following criteria apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If rail traffic exceeds 5 million gross tons in any year after 2008, the tonnage shall be calculated for the preceding two calendar years and if the total tonnage for those two calendar years exceeds 10 million gross tons, a PTCIP or its amendment is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If PIH traffic is carried on a track segment as a result of a request for rail service or rerouting warranted under part 172 of this title, and if the line carries in excess of 5 million gross tons of rail traffic as determined under this paragraph, a PTCIP or its amendment is required. This does not apply when temporary rerouting is authorized in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Once a railroad is notified by FRA that its RFA filed in accordance with this paragraph has been approved, the railroad shall equip the line with the applicable PTC system by December 31, 2015, or within 24 months, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exclusion or removal of track segments from PTC baseline--(i) Routing changes. In a PTCIP or an RFA, a railroad may request review of the requirement to install PTC on a track segment where a PTC system is otherwise required by this section, but has not yet been installed, based upon changes in rail traffic such as reductions in total traffic volume to a level below 5 million gross tons annually, cessation of passenger service or the approval of an MTEA, or the cessation of PIH materials traffic. Any such request shall be accompanied by estimated traffic projections for the next 5 years (e.g., as a result of planned rerouting, coordinations, or location of new business on the line).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> FRA will approve the exclusion requested pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section if the railroad establishes that, as of December 31, 2015:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No passenger service will be present on the involved track segment or the passenger service will be subject to an MTEA approved in accordance with 49 CFR 236.1019; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> No PIH traffic will be present on the involved track segment or the gross tonnage on the involved track segment will decline to below 5 million gross tons annually as computed over a 2-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Freight lines with de minimis risk not used for regularly provided intercity or commuter rail passenger service. (A) In a PTCIP or an RFA, a railroad may request review of the requirement to install a PTC system on a track segment where a PTC system is otherwise required by this section, but has not yet been installed, based upon the presence of a minimal quantity of PIH materials traffic. Any such request shall be accompanied by estimated traffic projections for the next 5 years (e.g., as a result of planned rerouting, coordination, or location of new business on the line). Where the request involves prior or planned rerouting of PIH materials traffic, the railroad must provide the information and analysis identified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The submission shall also include a full description of potential safety hazards on the segment of track and fully describe train operations over the line. This paragraph does not apply to line segments used for commuter rail or intercity rail passenger service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Absent special circumstances related to specific hazards presented by operations on the line segment, FRA will approve a request for relief under this paragraph for a rail line segment that meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That carries less than 15 million gross tons annually;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That does not have a heavy grade as ``heavy grade'' is defined in Sec. 232.407 of this chapter for any train operating over the track segment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the railroad adopts and complies with an operating rule requiring the crew of any train approaching working limits established under part 214 of this chapter to notify the roadway worker in charge of the train's approach at least 2 miles in advance of the working limits or, if the train crew does not have advance knowledge of the working limits, as soon as practical;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> That carries fewer than 100 cars containing PIH materials per year, excluding those cars containing only a residue, as defined in Sec. 171.8 of this title, of PIH materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> That carries 2 or fewer trains per day carrying any quantity of PIH materials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Where trains carrying any quantity of PIH materials operate at speeds not to exceed 40 miles per hour; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Where any train transporting a car containing any quantity of PIH materials is operated with a vacant block ahead of and behind the train.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> FRA may, in its discretion, approve other track segments not used for regularly provided intercity or commuter passenger service that have posed an equivalent or lesser level of risk of a PTC-preventable accident or PIH materials release as those track segments covered by paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, where such other track segments are similar to those covered by paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Failure to submit sufficient information will result in the denial of any request under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii). If the request is granted, on and after the date the line would have otherwise been required to be equipped

under the schedule contained in the PTCIP and approved by FRA, operations on the line shall be conducted in accordance with any conditions attached to the grant, including implementation of proposed mitigations as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Line sales. FRA does not approve removal of a line from the PTCIP exclusively based upon a representation that a track segment will be abandoned or sold to another railroad. In the event a track segment is approved for abandonment or transfer by the Surface Transportation Board, FRA will review at the request of the transferring and acquiring railroads whether the requirement to install PTC on the line should be removed given all of the circumstances, including expected traffic and hazardous materials levels, reservation of trackage or haulage rights by the transferring railroad, routing analysis under part 172 of this chapter, commercial and real property arrangements affecting the transferring and acquiring railroads post-transfer, and such other factors as may be relevant to continue safe operations on the line. If FRA denies the request, the acquiring railroad shall install the PTC system on the schedule provided in the transferring railroad's PTCIP, without regard to whether it is a Class I railroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> New rail passenger service. No new intercity or commuter rail passenger service shall commence after December 31, 2015, until a PTC system certified under this subpart has been installed and made operative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Hazard detectors. (1) All hazard detectors integrated into a signal or train control system on or after October 16, 2008, shall be integrated into PTC systems required by this subpart; and their warnings shall be appropriately and timely enforced as described in the applicable PTCSP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The applicable PTCSP must provide for receipt and presentation to the locomotive engineer and other train crew members of warnings from any additional hazard detectors using the PTC data network, onboard displays, and audible alerts. If the PTCSP so provides, the action to be taken by the system and by the crew members shall be specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The PTCDP (as applicable) and PTCSP for any new service described in Sec. 236.1007 to be conducted above 90 miles per hour shall include a hazard analysis describing the hazards relevant to the specific route(s) in question (e.g., potential for track obstruction due to events such as falling rock or undermining of the track structure due to high water or displacement of a bridge over navigable waters), the basis for decisions concerning hazard detectors provided, and the manner in which such additional hazard detectors will be interfaced with the PTC system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Event recorders. (1) Each lead locomotive, as defined in part 229, of a train equipped and operating with a PTC system required by this subpart must be equipped with an operative event recorder, which shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Record safety-critical train control data routed to the locomotive engineer's display that the engineer is required to comply with;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specifically include text messages conveying mandatory directives, maximum authorized speeds, PTC system brake warnings, PTC system brake enforcements, and the state of the PTC system (e.g., cut in, cut out, active, or failed); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Include examples of how the captured data will be displayed during playback along with the format, content, and data retention duration requirements specified in the PTCSP submitted and approved pursuant to this paragraph. If such train control data can be calibrated against other data required by this part, it may, at the election of the railroad, be retained in a separate memory module.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each lead locomotive, as defined in part 229, manufactured and in service after October 1, 2009, that is equipped and operating with a PTC system required by this subpart, shall be equipped with an event recorder memory module meeting the crash hardening requirements of Sec. 229.135 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this subpart excepts compliance with any of the event recorder requirements contained in Sec. 229.135 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Switch position. The following requirements apply with respect to determining proper switch position under

this section. When a main line switch position is unknown or improperly aligned for a train's route in advance of the train's movement, the PTC system will provide warning of the condition associated with the following enforcement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A PTC system shall enforce restricted speed over any switch:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Where train movements are made with the benefit of the indications of a wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety proposed to FRA and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety, requires the train to be operated at restricted speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A PTC system shall enforce a positive stop short of any main line switch, and any switch on a siding where the allowable speed is in excess of 20 miles per hour, if movement of the train over the switch:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Is made without the benefit of the indications of a wayside or cab signal system or other similar appliance, method, device, or system of equivalent safety proposed to FRA and approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with this part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Would create an unacceptable risk. Unacceptable risk includes conditions when traversing the switch, even at low speeds, could result in direct conflict with the movement of another train (including a hand-operated crossover between main tracks, a hand-operated crossover between a main track and an adjoining siding or auxiliary track, or a hand-operated switch providing access to another subdivision or branch line, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A PTC system required by this subpart shall be designed, installed, and maintained to perform the switch position detection and enforcement described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, except as provided for and justified in the applicable, FRA approved PTCDP or PTCSP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The control circuit or electronic equivalent for all movement authorities over any switches, movable-point frogs, or derails shall be selected through circuit controller or functionally equivalent device operated directly by the switch points, derail, or by switch locking mechanism, or through relay or electronic device controlled by such circuit controller or functionally equivalent device, for each switch, movable-point frog, or derail in the route governed. Circuits or electronic equivalent shall be arranged so that any movement authorities less restrictive than those prescribed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section can only be provided when each switch, movable-point frog, or derail in the route governed is in proper position, and shall be in accordance with subparts A through G of this part, unless it is otherwise provided in a PTCSP approved under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Train-to-train collision. A PTC system shall be considered to be configured to prevent train-to-train collisions within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section if trains are required to be operated at restricted speed and if the onboard PTC equipment enforces the upper limits of the railroad's restricted speed rule (15 or 20 miles per hour). This application applies to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Operating conditions under which trains are required by signal indication or operating rule to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Stop before continuing; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reduce speed to restricted speed and continue at restricted speed until encountering a more favorable indication or as provided by operating rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operation of trains within the limits of a joint mandatory directive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Temporary rerouting. A train equipped with a PTC system as required by this subpart may be temporarily rerouted onto a track not equipped with a PTC system and a train not equipped with a PTC system may be temporarily rerouted onto a track equipped with a PTC system as required by this subpart in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Emergencies. In the event of an emergency--including conditions such as derailment, flood, fire, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, or other similar circumstance outside of the railroad's control--that would prevent usage of the regularly used track if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The rerouting is applicable only until the emergency condition ceases

to exist and for no more than 14 consecutive calendar days, unless otherwise extended by approval of the Associate Administrator;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The railroad provides written or telephonic notification to the applicable Regional Administrator of the information listed in paragraph (i) of this section within one business day of the beginning of the rerouting made in accordance with this paragraph; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The conditions contained in paragraph (j) of this section are followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planned maintenance. In the event of planned maintenance that would prevent usage of the regularly used track if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maintenance period does not exceed 30 days;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A request is filed with the applicable Regional Administrator in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section no less than 10 business days prior to the planned rerouting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The conditions contained in paragraph (j) of this section are followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Rerouting requests. (1) For the purposes of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the rerouting request shall be self-executing unless the applicable Regional Administrator responds with a notice disapproving of the rerouting or providing instructions to allow rerouting. Such instructions may include providing additional information to the Regional Administrator or Associate Administrator prior to the commencement of rerouting. Once the Regional Administrator responds with a notice under this paragraph, no rerouting may occur until the Regional Administrator or Associate Administrator provides his or her approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event the temporary rerouting described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is to exceed 30 consecutive calendar days:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The railroad shall provide a request in accordance with paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section with the Associate Administrator no less than 10 business days prior to the planned rerouting; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rerouting shall not commence until receipt of approval from the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Content of rerouting request. Each notice or request referenced in paragraph (g) and (h) of this section must indicate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The dates that such temporary rerouting will occur;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number and types of trains that will be rerouted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The location of the affected tracks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A description of the necessity for the temporary rerouting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Rerouting conditions. Rerouting of operations under paragraph (g) of this section may occur under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where a train not equipped with a PTC system is rerouted onto a track equipped with a PTC system, or a train not equipped with a PTC system that is compatible and functionally responsive to the PTC system utilized on the line to which the train is being rerouted, the train shall be operated in accordance with Sec. 236.1029; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where any train is rerouted onto a track not equipped with a PTC system, the train shall be operated in accordance with the operating rules applicable to the line on which the train is rerouted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Rerouting cessation. The applicable Regional Administrator may order a railroad to cease any rerouting provided under paragraph (g) or (h) of this section.
