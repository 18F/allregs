                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--(1) Coverage.

The rules cover any proposal to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coverage. (i) This section establishes the rules governing the Postal Service's consideration of whether an existing retail Post Office, station, or branch should be discontinued. The rules cover any proposal to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This section establishes the rules governing the Postal Service's consideration of whether an existing retail Post Office, station, or branch should be discontinued. The rules cover any proposal to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Replace a USPS-operated Post Office, station, or branch with a contractor-operated retail facility;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Combine a USPS-operated Post Office, station, or branch with another USPS-operated retail facility; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Discontinue a USPS-operated Post Office, station, or branch without providing a replacement facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The conversion of a Post Office into, or the replacement of a Post Office with, another type of USPS-operated retail facility is not a discontinuance action subject to this section. A change in the staffing of a Post Office such that it is staffed only part-time by a postmaster, or not staffed at all by a postmaster, but rather by another type of USPS employee, is not a discontinuance action subject to this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The regulations in this section are mandatory only with respect to discontinuance actions for which initial feasibility studies have been initiated on or after July 14, 2011. Unless otherwise provided by responsible personnel, the rules under Sec. 241.3 as in effect prior to July 14, 2011, shall apply to discontinuance actions for which initial feasibility studies have been initiated prior to July 14, 2011. Discontinuance actions pending as of December 1, 2011, that pertain to the conversion of a Post Office to another type of USPS-operated facility are no longer subject to these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. As used in this section, the terms listed below are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``USPS-operated retail facility'' includes any Postal Service employee-operated Post Office, station, or branch, but does not include any station, branch, community Post Office, or other retail facility operated by a contractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``Contractor-operated retail facility'' includes any station, branch, community Post Office, or other facility, including a private business, offering retail postal services that is operated by a contractor, and does not include any USPS-operated retail facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> ``Closing'' means an action in which Post Office operations are permanently discontinued without providing a replacement facility in the community.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ``Consolidation'' means an action that converts a Postal Service-operated retail facility into a contractor-operated retail facility. The resulting contractor-operated retail facility reports to a Postal Service-operated retail facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> ``Discontinuance'' means either a closure or a consolidation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A ``Remotely Managed Post Office'' (RMPO) is a Post Office that offers

part-time window service hours, is staffed by a Postal Service employee at the direction of a postmaster, and reports to an Administrative Post Office. Unless otherwise specified, all references to ``Post Office'' include RMPOs. The classification of a Post Office as an RMPO is not a discontinuance action under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A ``Part-Time Post Office'' (PTPO) is a Post Office that offers part-time window service hours, is staffed by a Postal Service employee, and reports to a district office. Unless otherwise specified, all references to ``Post Office'' include PTPOs. The classification of a Post Office as a PTPO is not a discontinuance action under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requirements. A District Manager or the responsible Headquarters Vice President, or a designee of either, may initiate a feasibility study of a USPS-operated facility for possible discontinuance. Any decision to close or consolidate a USPS-operated retail facility may be effected only upon the consideration of certain factors. These include the effect on the community served; the effect on employees of the USPS-operated retail facility; compliance with government policy established by law that the Postal Service must provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where Post Offices are not self-sustaining; the economic savings to the Postal Service; and any other factors the Postal Service determines necessary. In addition, certain mandatory procedures apply as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The public must be given 60 days' notice of a proposed action to enable the persons served by a USPS-operated retail facility to evaluate the proposal and provide comments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After public comments are received and taken into account, any final determination to close or consolidate a USPS-operated retail facility must be made in writing and must include findings covering all the required considerations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The written determination must be made available to persons served by the USPS-operated retail facility at least 60 days before the discontinuance takes effect.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Within the first 30 days after the written determination is made available, any person regularly served by a Post Office subject to discontinuance may appeal the decision to the Postal Regulatory Commission. Where persons regularly served by another type of USPS-operated retail facility subject to discontinuance file an appeal with the Postal Regulatory Commission, the General Counsel reserves the right to assert defenses, including the Commission's lack of jurisdiction over such appeals. For purposes of determining whether an appeal is filed within the 30-day period, receipt by the Commission is based on the postmark of the appeal, if sent through the mail, or on other appropriate documentation or indicia, if sent through another lawful delivery method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The Commission may only affirm the Postal Service determination or return the matter for further consideration but may not modify the determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Commission is required to make any determination subject to 39 U.S.C. 404(d)(5) within the 120 days specified by statute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The following table summarizes the notice and appeal periods defined by statute.</p><p class="depth4">Public Notice of Proposal
60-day notice</p><p class="depth4">Public Notice of Final Determination
30 days for filing any appeal; up to 120    Wait at least 60 days from</p><p class="depth4">days for appeal consideration and           first day after posting</p><p class="depth4">decision.                                   final determination before</p><p class="depth4">closing or consolidating</p><p class="depth4">USPS-operated retail</p><p class="depth4">facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional requirements. This section also includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rules to ensure that the community's identity as a postal address is preserved.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Rules for consideration of a proposed discontinuance and for its implementation, if approved. These rules are designed to ensure that the reasons leading to discontinuance of a particular USPS-operated retail facility are fully articulated and disclosed at a

stage that enables customer participation to make a helpful contribution toward the final decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Initial feasibility study. A district manager, the responsible Headquarters vice president, or a designee of either may initiate a feasibility study of a USPS-operated retail facility's potential discontinuance, in order to assist the district manager in determining whether to proceed with a written proposal to discontinue the facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Permissible circumstances. The initial feasibility study may be based upon circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A postmaster vacancy;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Emergency suspension of the USPS-operated retail facility due to cancellation of a lease or rental agreement when no suitable alternate quarters are available in the community, a fire or natural disaster, irreparable damage when no suitable alternate quarters are available in the community, challenge to the sanctity of the mail, or similar reasons;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Earned workload below the minimum established level for the lowest level RMPO;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Insufficient customer demand, evidenced by declining or low volume, revenue, revenue units, local business activity, or local population trends;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The availability of reasonable alternate access to postal services for the community served by the USPS-operated retail facility; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The incorporation of two communities into one or other special circumstances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Impermissible circumstances. The following circumstances may not be used to justify initiation of an initial feasibility study:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any claim that the continued operation of a building without handicapped modifications is inconsistent with the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The absence of running water or restroom facilities;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In the absence of any circumstances identified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the operation of a small Post Office at a deficit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notice to customers. Local management must provide notification and questionnaires to customers at the USPS-operated retail facility under study. Local management may determine whether notification is appropriate through media outlets. In addition, the following customers that receive delivery service from the USPS-operated retail facility must receive notification and questionnaires by mail:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Post Office Box customers at the USPS-operated retail facility under study;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Customers whose delivery carrier is stationed out of the USPS-operated retail facility under study;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Customers in the delivery area of the same ZIP Code as the retail facility under study, regardless of whether the delivery carriers for those customers are stationed out of the retail facility under study or out of a nearby facility; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Customers whom the retail facility under study serves for allied delivery services such as mail pickup.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Initial feasibility study due to emergency suspension. Wherever possible when an initial feasibility study is to be initiated under Sec. 241.3(a)(5)(i)(B) (for example, when it is anticipated that a lease or rental agreement will be cancelled with no suitable alternate quarters available in the community), responsible personnel should initiate the initial feasibility study sufficiently in advance of the circumstance prompting the emergency suspension to allow a meaningful opportunity for public input to be taken into account. If public input cannot be sought sufficiently in advance of the end date of the lease or rental agreement, responsible personnel should endeavor, to the extent possible, to continue operation of the USPS-operated retail facility for the duration necessary to gather public input and make a more fully informed decision on whether to proceed with a discontinuance proposal. Customers formerly served by the suspended facility should receive notice under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, including by mail, to the same extent that they would have if the facility were not in suspended status at the time of the

initial feasibility study, proposal, or final determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preservation of community address--(1) Policy. The Postal Service permits the use of a community's separate address to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Policy. The Postal Service permits the use of a community's separate address to the extent practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ZIP Code assignment. The ZIP Code for each address formerly served from the discontinued USPS-operated retail facility should be kept, wherever practical. In some cases, the ZIP Code originally assigned to the discontinued USPS-operated retail facility may be changed if the responsible District Manager receives approval from his or her Vice President, Area Operations, before any proposal to discontinue the USPS-operated retail facility is posted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In a consolidation, the ZIP Code for the replacement contractor-operated retail facility is the ZIP Code originally assigned to the discontinued facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the ZIP Code is changed and the parent or gaining USPS-operated retail facility covers several ZIP Codes, the ZIP Code must be that of the delivery area within which the facility is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> USPS-operated retail facility's city name in address. If all the delivery addresses using the city name of the USPS-operated retail facility being discontinued continue to use the same ZIP Code, customers may continue to use the discontinued facility's city name in their addresses, instead of that of the new delivering USPS-operated retail facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name of facility established by consolidation. If a USPS-operated retail facility is consolidated by establishing in its place a contractor-operated facility, the replacement unit can be given the same name of the facility that is replaced, if appropriate in light of the nature of the contract and level of service provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial proposal--(1) In general. If a District Manager believes that the discontinuance of a USPS-operated retail facility within his or her responsibility may be warranted, the District Manager:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If a District Manager believes that the discontinuance of a USPS-operated retail facility within his or her responsibility may be warranted, the District Manager:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Must use the standards and procedures in Sec. 241.3(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Must investigate the situation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May propose the USPS-operated retail facility be discontinued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consolidation. The proposed action may include a consolidation of USPS-operated retail facilities. A consolidation arises when a USPS-operated retail facility is replaced with a contractor-operated retail facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Views of postmasters. Whether the discontinuance under consideration involves a consolidation or not, the District Manager must discuss the matter with the postmaster (or the officer in charge) of the USPS-operated retail facility considered for discontinuance, and with the postmaster of any other USPS-operated retail facility affected by the change. The District Manager should make sure that these officials are invited to submit written comments and suggestions as part of the record when the proposal is reviewed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Preparation of written proposal. The District Manager, or a designee, must gather and preserve for the record all documentation used to assess the proposed change. If the District Manager thinks the proposed action is warranted, he or she, or a designee, must prepare a document titled ``Proposal to (Close) (Consolidate) the (Facility Name).'' This document must describe, analyze, and justify in sufficient detail to Postal Service management and affected customers the proposed service change. The written proposal must address each of the following matters in separate sections:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Responsiveness to community postal needs. It is the policy of the Government, as established by law, that the Postal Service will provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. The proposal should:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Contrast the services available before and after the proposed change;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Describe how the changes respond to the postal needs of the affected customers; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Highlight particular aspects of customer service that might be less advantageous as well as more advantageous.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effect on community. The proposal must include an analysis of the effect the proposed discontinuance might have on the community served, and

discuss the application of the requirements in Sec. 241.3(b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Effect on employees. The written proposal must summarize the possible effects of the change on postmasters and other employees of the USPS-operated retail facility considered for discontinuance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Savings. The proposal must include an analysis of the economic savings to the Postal Service from the proposed action, including the cost or savings expected from each major factor contributing to the overall estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other factors. The proposal should include an analysis of other factors that the District Manager determines are necessary for a complete evaluation of the proposed change, whether favorable or unfavorable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Summary. The proposal must include a summary that explains why the proposed action is necessary, and assesses how the factors supporting the proposed change outweigh any negative factors. In taking competing considerations into account, the need to provide regular and effective service is paramount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Notice. The proposal must include the following notices:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Supporting materials. ``Copies of all materials on which this proposal is based are available for public inspection at (Facility Name) during normal office hours.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Nature of posting. ``This is a proposal. It is not a final determination to (close) (consolidate) this facility.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Posting of final determination. ``If a final determination is made to close or consolidate this facility, after public comments on this proposal are received and taken into account, a notice of that final determination will be posted in this facility.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Appeal rights. ``The final determination will contain instructions on how affected customers may appeal a decision to close or consolidate a post office to the Postal Regulatory Commission. Any such appeal must be received by the Commission within 30 days of the posting of the final determination.'' The notice in this clause is provided when the USPS-operated retail facility under study is a post office. For purposes of this clause, the date of receipt by the Commission is based on the postmark of the appeal, if sent through the mail, or on other appropriate documentation or indicia, if sent through another lawful delivery method.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notice, public comment, and record--(1) Posting proposal and comment notice. A copy of the written proposal and a signed invitation for comments must be posted prominently, with additional copies to be given to customers upon request, in the following locations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Posting proposal and comment notice. A copy of the written proposal and a signed invitation for comments must be posted prominently, with additional copies to be given to customers upon request, in the following locations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The USPS-operated retail facility under study, unless service at the facility has been suspended;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The USPS-operated retail facility proposed to serve as the supervising facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any USPS-operated retail facility likely to serve a significant number of customers of the USPS-operated retail facility under study; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If service at the facility under study has been suspended, any USPS-operated retail facility providing alternative service for former customers of the facility under study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contents of comment notice. The invitation for comments must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ask interested persons to provide written comments within 60 days, to a stated address, offering specific opinions and information, favorable or unfavorable, on the potential effect of the proposed change on postal services and the community.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> State that copies of the proposal with attached optional comment forms are available in the affected USPS-operated retail facilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a name and telephone number to call for information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other steps. In addition to providing notice and inviting comment, the District Manager must take any other steps necessary to ensure that the persons served by affected USPS-operated retail facilities understand the nature and implications of the proposed action. A community meeting must be held to provide outreach and gain public input after the proposal is posted, unless otherwise instructed by the responsible Headquarters Vice President or the applicable Vice President, Area Operations. Authorization to forgo a community meeting should

issue only where exceptional circumstances make a community meeting infeasible, such as where the community no longer exists because of a natural disaster or because residents have moved elsewhere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If oral contacts develop views or information not previously documented, whether favorable or unfavorable to the proposal, the District Manager should encourage persons offering the views or information to provide written comments to preserve them for the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As a factor in making his or her decision, the District Manager may not rely on communications received from anyone unless submitted in writing for the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record. The District Manager must keep, as part of the record for consideration and review, all documentation gathered about the proposed change.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The record must include all information that the District Manager considered, and the decision must stand on the record. No written information or views submitted by customers may be excluded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The docket number assigned to the proposal must be the ZIP Code of the office proposed for closing or consolidation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The record must include a chronological index in which each document contained is identified and numbered as filed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> As written communications are received in response to the public notice and invitation for comments, they are included in the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A complete copy of the record must be available for public inspection during normal office hours at the USPS-operated retail facilities where the proposal was posted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, beginning no later than the date on which notice is posted and extending through the posting period. When appropriate, certain personally identifiable information, such as individual names or residential addresses, may be redacted from the publicly accessible copy of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Copies of documents in the record (except the proposal and comment form) are provided on request and on payment of fees as noted in chapter 4 of Handbook AS-353, Guide to Privacy, the Freedom of Information Act, and Records Management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consideration of public comments and final local recommendation--(1) Analysis of comments. The District Manager or a designee must prepare an analysis of the public comments received for consideration and inclusion in the record. If possible, comments subsequently received should also be included in the analysis. The analysis should list and briefly describe each point favorable to the proposal and each point unfavorable to the proposal. The analysis should identify to the extent possible how many comments support each point listed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Analysis of comments. The District Manager or a designee must prepare an analysis of the public comments received for consideration and inclusion in the record. If possible, comments subsequently received should also be included in the analysis. The analysis should list and briefly describe each point favorable to the proposal and each point unfavorable to the proposal. The analysis should identify to the extent possible how many comments support each point listed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Re-evaluation of proposal. After completing the analysis, the District Manager must review the proposal and re-evaluate all the tentative conclusions previously made in light of additional customer information and views in the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Discontinuance not warranted. If the District Manager decides against the proposed discontinuance, he or she must post, in the USPS-operated retail facilities where the proposal was posted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a notice stating that the proposed closing or consolidation is not warranted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Discontinuance warranted. If the District Manager decides that the proposed discontinuance is justified, the appropriate sections of the proposal must be revised, taking into account the comments received from the public. After making necessary revisions, the District Manager must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Transmit the revised proposal and the entire record to the responsible Headquarters Vice President.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Certify that all documents in the record are originals or true and correct copies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Postal Service decision--(1) In general. The responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee must review the proposal of the District Manager and decide on the merits of the proposal.

The responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee may approve the proposed discontinuance, with or without further revisions. If approved without further revision, the term ``Final Determination'' is substituted for ``Proposal'' in the title. A copy of the Final Determination must be provided to the District Manager. The Final Determination constitutes the Postal Service determination for the purposes of 39 U.S.C. 404(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Supporting materials. The Final Determination must include the following notice: ``Copies of all materials on which this Final Determination is based are available for public inspection at the (Facility Name) during normal office hours.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Appeal rights. If the USPS-operated retail facility subject to discontinuance is a post office, the Final Determination must include the following notice: ``Pursuant to Public Law 94-421 (1976), this Final Determination to (close) (consolidate) the (Facility Name) may be appealed by any person served by that office to the Postal Regulatory Commission, 901 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001.

A District Manager may request a different date for official discontinuance in the Retail Change Announcement document submitted to the responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee. However, the

USPS-operated retail facility may not be discontinued sooner than 60 days after the first day of the posting of the notice required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Actions during appeal--(i) Implementation of discontinuance. If an appeal is filed, only the responsible Headquarters Vice President may direct a discontinuance before disposition of the appeal.
