                            <p class="depth0">In the enforcement of the Act, an employee will be regarded as ``employed as a seaman'' if his work as a whole meets the test stated in Sec. 783.31, even though during the workweek he performs some work of a nature other than that which characterizes the service of a seaman, if such nonseaman's work is not substantial in amount. For enforcement purposes, the Administrator's position is that such differing work is ``substantial'' if it occupies more than 20 percent of the time worked by the employee during the workweek.</p><p class="depth0">What Is an ``American Vessel''</p>
