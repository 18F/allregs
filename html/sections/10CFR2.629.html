Except as provided in 10 CFR 2.758, in making the findings required for issuance of a combined license, the Commission shall treat as resolved those matters resolved in connection with the issuance of the partial decision on site suitability issues. If the Commission reaches an adverse decision, the application shall be denied without prejudice for resubmission, provided, however, that in determining whether the resubmitted application is complete and acceptable for docketing under Sec. 2.101(a)(3), the Director of the Office of New Reactors or the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, as appropriate, shall determine whether the resubmitted application addresses those matters identified as bases for denial of the original application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding any provision in 10 CFR 50.109, while a partial decision on site suitability is in effect under Sec. 2.617(b)(2), the Commission may not modify, rescind, or impose new requirements with respect to matters within the scope of the site suitability decision, whether on its own motion, or in response to a request or petition from any person, unless the Commission determines that a modification to the original decision is necessary either for compliance with the Commission's regulations applicable and in effect at the time the partial decision was issued, or to assure adequate protection of the public health and safety or the common defense and security.</p><p class="depth2">Phased Applications Involving Limited Work Authorizations</p><p class="depth2">Source: 72 FR 57440, Oct. 9, 2007, unless otherwise noted.</p>
