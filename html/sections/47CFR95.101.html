                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A GMRS license authorizes a GMRS station to transmit messages to other GMRS stations at any geographical location within or over the territorial limits of any area where radio services are regulated by the FCC. These points are listed in Appendix A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The license does not authorize operation as a common carrier or communication of messages for pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the licensee is a corporation and the license so indicates, it may use its GMRS system to furnish non-profit radio communication service to its parent corporation, to another subsidiary of the same parent, or to its own subsidiary. Such use is not subject to the cooperative use provisions of Sec. 95.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For non-individual licensees, the license together with the system specifications for that license as maintained by the Commission represent the non-individual licensees' maximum authorized system.
