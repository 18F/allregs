                            <p class="depth0">You may use the emission rate without add-on controls option for any individual coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all the coating operations in the affected source. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use this option. To demonstrate initial compliance using the emission rate without add-on controls option, the coating operation or group of coating operations must meet the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4690. Any coating operation for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option is not required to meet the operating limits or work practice standards required in Sec. Sec. 63.4692 and 63.4693, respectively. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4690 for the coating operation(s). When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate with add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the coating operation(s) for which you use the emission rate without add-on controls option.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each material. Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during each month according to the requirements in Sec. 63.4741(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating. Determine the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating used during

each month according to the requirements in Sec. 63.4741(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determine the density of each material. Determine the density of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during each month from test results using ASTM Method D1475-90, information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material, or reference sources providing density or specific gravity data for pure materials. If there is disagreement between ASTM Method D1475-90 test results and such other information sources, the test results will take precedence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determine the volume of each material used. Determine the volume (liters) of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during each month by measurement or usage records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions. The mass of organic HAP emissions is the combined mass of organic HAP contained in all coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during each month minus the organic HAP in certain waste materials. Calculate it using Equation 1 of this section.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR98AD03.002

(You may assign</p><p class="depth2">a value of zero to Rw if you do not wish to use</p><p class="depth2">this allowance.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Calculate the mass of organic HAP in the coatings used during the month, using Equation 1A of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR98AD03.003

The TSDF may be either off-site or on-site. You may not include organic HAP contained in wastewater.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> You must determine either the amount of the waste materials sent to a TSDF during the month or the amount collected and stored during the month and designated for future transport to a TSDF. Do not include in your determination any waste materials sent to a TSDF during a month if you have already included them in the amount collected and stored during that month or a previous month.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the total mass of organic HAP contained in the waste materials specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(iv)</em> You may use any reasonable methodology to determine the amount of waste materials and the total mass of organic HAP they contain, and you must document your methodology as required in Sec. 63.4730(h). To the extent that waste manifests include this information, they may be used as part of the documentation of the amount of waste materials and mass of organic HAP contained in them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculate the total volume of coating solids used. Determine the total volume of coating solids used which is the combined volume of coating solids for all the coatings used during each month, using Equation 2 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR98AD03.006
