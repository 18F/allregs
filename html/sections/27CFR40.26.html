When tobacco products are released in bond from customs custody for transfer to the bonded premises of a manufacturer of tobacco products, the transferee shall become liable for the tax on such products upon release from customs custody. Any person who possesses tobacco products in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5751(a)(1) or (2), shall be liable for a tax equal to the tax on such products.
