                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for records. (1) A request for any information or  record shall be addressed to the Secretary, United States International  Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436 and shall  indicate clearly in the request, and if the request is in paper form on  the envelope, that it is a ``Freedom of Information Act Request.'' A  written request may be made either </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> in paper form, or (2)  electronically by contacting the Commission at http://www.usitc.gov/ foia.htm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any request shall reasonably describe the requested record to  facilitate location of the record. If the request pertains to a record  that is part of the Commission's file in an investigation, the request  should identify the investigation by number and name. A clear  description of the requested record(s) should reduce the time required  by the Commission to locate and disclose releasable responsive record(s)  and minimize any applicable search and copying charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, requests  will be processed in the order in which they are filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for transcripts of hearings should be addressed to the  official hearing reporter, the name and address of which can be obtained  from the Secretary. A copy of such request shall at the same time be  forwarded to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Copies of public Commission reports and other publications can  be requested by calling or writing the Publications Office in the Office  of the Secretary. Generally, such publications can be obtained more  quickly from this office. Certain Commission publications are sold by  the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, and  are available from that agency at the price set by that agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A day-to-day, composite record will be kept by the Secretary of  each request with the disposition thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Expedited processing. (1) Requests for records under paragraph  (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section will be taken out of order and given expedited  treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could  reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or  physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged  federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in  disseminating information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which  there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which  affect public confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of  the initial request for records or at any later time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a  statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's  knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting  expedited processing. For example, a requester within paragraph  (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media,  must establish that he or she is a person whose main professional  activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not  be his or her sole occupation. A requester within paragraph (b)(1)(ii)  of this section also must establish a particular urgency to inform the  public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the  public's right to know about government activity generally. The  formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative  discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited  processing, the Secretary will decide whether to grant it and will  notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited  treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be  processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing  is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Public reading room. The Commission maintains a public reading  room in the Office of the Secretary for access to the records that the  FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection and  copying. Reading room records created by the Commission on or after  November 1, 1996, are available electronically. This includes a current  subject-matter index of reading room records, which will indicate which  records are available electronically.
