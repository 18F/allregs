                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Under the HFRP, NRCS will purchase conservation easements from, or enter into 30-year contracts or 10-year cost-share agreements with, eligible landowners who voluntarily cooperate in the restoration and protection of forestlands and associated lands. To participate in HFRP, a landowner will agree to the implementation of a HFRP restoration plan, the effect of which is to restore, protect, enhance, maintain, and manage the habitat conditions necessary to increase the likelihood of recovery of listed species under the ESA, or measurably improve the well-being of species that are not listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA but are candidates for such listing, State-listed species, or species identified by the Chief for special consideration for funding. NRCS may provide cost-share assistance for the activities that promote the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of forest ecosystem functions and values. Specific restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management activities may be undertaken by the landowner or other NRCS designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Of the total amount of funds expended under the program for a fiscal year to acquire easements and enter into 10-year cost-share agreements, not more than 40 percent will be used for cost-share agreements, and not more than 60 percent will be used for easements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Chief may use any funds that are not obligated by April 1 of the fiscal year for which the funds are made available to carry out a different method of enrollment during that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Landowner eligibility. To be eligible to enroll an easement in the HFRP, an individual or entity must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agree to provide such information to NRCS, as the agency deems necessary or desirable, to assist in its determination of eligibility for program benefits and for other program implementation purposes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comply with applicable registration and reporting requirements of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended), and 2 CFR parts 25 and 170.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible land. (1) NRCS, in coordination with FWS or NMFS, will determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration, enhancement, and protection of forest ecosystem functions and values when considering the cost of acquiring the easement, 30-year contract, or 10-year cost share agreement, and the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS, in coordination with FWS or NMFS, will determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful restoration, enhancement, and protection of forest ecosystem functions and values when considering the cost of acquiring the easement, 30-year contract, or 10-year cost share agreement, and the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Land will be considered eligible for enrollment in the HFRP only if NRCS determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such private land will contribute to the restoration or enhancement of the habitat or otherwise measurably increase the likelihood of recovery for a selected species listed under section 4 of the ESA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such private land will contribute to the restoration or enhancement of the habitat or otherwise measurably improve the well-being of a selected species not listed under section 4 of the ESA but is a candidate for such listing, or the selected species is a State-listed

species, or is a species identified by the Chief for special consideration for funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NRCS may also enroll land adjacent to eligible land if the enrollment of such adjacent land would contribute significantly to the practical administration of the easement area, but not more than it determines is necessary for such contribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To be enrolled in the program, eligible land must be configured in a size and with boundaries that allow for the efficient management of the area for easement purposes and otherwise promote and enhance program objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of acreage owned by an Indian tribe, NRCS may enroll acreage into the HFRP which is privately owned by either the tribe or an individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ineligible land. The following land is not eligible for enrollment in the HFRP:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Land owned by the United States, States, or units of local government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Land subject to an easement or deed restriction that already provides for the protection of fish and wildlife habitat or that would interfere with HFRP purposes, as determined by NRCS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Land that would not be eligible for HFRP under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5).
