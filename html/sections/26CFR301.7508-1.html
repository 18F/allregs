                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> and to other acts specified in a revenue ruling,  revenue procedure, notice, or other guidance published in the Internal  Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. This section applies to any period for  performing an act that has not expired before December 30, 1999.  [T.D. 8911, 65 FR 78411, Dec. 15, 2000]    Sec. 301.7508A-1  Postponement of certain tax-related deadlines by reasons of a federally declared disaster or terroristic or military action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section provides rules by which the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) may postpone deadlines for performing certain acts with  respect to taxes other than taxes not administered by the IRS such as  firearms tax (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter  36, section 4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Postponed deadlines--(1) In general. In the case of a taxpayer  determined by the Secretary to be affected by a federally declared  disaster (as defined in section 1033(h)(3)) or a terroristic or military  action (as defined in section 692(c)(2)), the Secretary may specify a  postponement period (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) of  up to one year that may be disregarded in determining under the internal  revenue laws, in respect of any tax liability of the affected taxpayer  (as defined in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether any or all of the acts described in paragraph (c) of  this section were performed within the time prescribed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of interest, penalty, additional amount, or addition  to the tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of credit or refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of postponement period. When an affected taxpayer is  required to perform a tax-related act by a due date that falls within  the postponement period, the affected taxpayer is eligible for  postponement of time to perform the act until the last day of the  period. The affected taxpayer is eligible for relief from interest,  penalties, additional amounts, or additions to tax during the  postponement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interaction between postponement period and extensions of time  to file or pay--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The postponement period under section  7508A runs concurrently with extensions of time to file and pay, if any,  under other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Original due date prior to, but extended due date within, the  postponement period. When the original due date precedes the first day  of the postponement period and the extended due date falls within the  postponement period, the following rules apply. If an affected taxpayer  received an extension of time to file, filing will be timely on or  before the last day of the postponement period, and the taxpayer is  eligible for relief from penalties or additions to tax related to the  failure to file during the postponement period. Similarly, if an  affected taxpayer received an extension of time to pay, payment will be  timely on or before the last day of the postponement period, and the  taxpayer is eligible for relief from interest, penalties, additions to  tax, or additional amounts related to the failure to pay during the  postponement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Due date not extended. The postponement of the deadline of a  tax-related act does not extend the due date for the act, but merely  allows the IRS to disregard a time period of up to one year for  performance of the act. To the extent that other statutes may rely on  the date a return is due to be filed, the postponement period will not  change the due date of the return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional relief. The rules of this paragraph (b) demonstrate  how the IRS generally implements section 7508A. The IRS may determine,  however, that additional relief to taxpayers is appropriate and may  provide additional relief to the extent allowed under section 7508A. To  the extent that the IRS grants additional relief, the IRS will provide  specific guidance on the scope of relief in the manner provided in  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acts for which a period may be disregarded--(1) Acts performed  by taxpayers. Paragraph (b) of this section applies to the following  acts performed by affected taxpayers (as defined in paragraph (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of  this section)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Filing any return of income tax, estate tax, gift tax,  generation-skipping transfer tax, excise tax (other than firearms tax  (chapter 32, section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section  4461); and alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E)), or employment tax  (including income tax withheld at source and income tax imposed by  subtitle C or any law superseded thereby);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paying any income tax, estate tax, gift tax, generation- skipping transfer tax, excise tax (other than firearms tax (chapter 32,  section 4181); harbor maintenance tax (chapter 36, section 4461); and  alcohol and tobacco taxes (subtitle E)), employment tax (including  income tax withheld at source and income tax imposed by subtitle C or  any law superseded thereby), any installment of those taxes (including  payment under section 6159 relating to installment agreements), or of  any other liability to the United States in respect thereof, but not  including deposits of taxes pursuant to section 6302 and the regulations  under section 6302;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Making contributions to a qualified retirement plan (within  the meaning of section 4974(c)) under section 219(f)(3), 404(a)(6),  404(h)(1)(B), or 404(m)(2); making distributions under section  408(d)(4); recharacterizing contributions under section 408A(d)(6); or  making a rollover under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or  408(d)(3);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Filing a petition with the Tax Court, or for review of a  decision rendered by the Tax Court;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Filing a claim for credit or refund of any tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Bringing suit upon a claim for credit or refund of any tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any other act specified in a revenue ruling, revenue  procedure, notice, announcement, news release, or other guidance  published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of  this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acts performed by the government. Paragraph (b) of this section  applies to the following acts performed by the government--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Assessing any tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Giving or making any notice or demand for the payment of any  tax, or with respect to any liability to the United States in respect of  any tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Collecting by the Secretary, by levy or otherwise, of the  amount of any liability in respect of any tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Bringing suit by the United States, or any officer on its  behalf, in respect of any liability in respect of any tax;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Allowing a credit or refund of any tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any other act specified in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure,  notice, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin  (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Affected taxpayer means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual whose principal residence (for purposes of  section 1033(h)(4)) is located in a covered disaster area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any business entity or sole proprietor whose principal place of  business is located in a covered disaster area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any individual who is a relief worker affiliated with a  recognized government or philanthropic organization and who is assisting  in a covered disaster area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any individual whose principal residence (for purposes of  section 1033(h)(4)), or any business entity or sole proprietor whose  principal place of business is not located in a covered disaster area,  but whose records necessary to meet a deadline for an act specified in  paragraph (c) of this section are maintained in a covered disaster area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any estate or trust that has tax records necessary to meet a  deadline for an act specified in paragraph (c) of this section and that  are maintained in a covered disaster area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The spouse of an affected taxpayer, solely with regard to a  joint return of the husband and wife; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any individual, business entity, or sole proprietorship not  located in a covered disaster area, but whose records necessary to meet  a deadline for an act specified in paragraph (c) of this section are  located in the covered disaster area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Any individual visiting the covered disaster area who was  killed or injured as a result of the disaster; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Any other person determined by the IRS to be affected by a  federally declared disaster (within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Covered disaster area means an area of a federally declared  disaster (within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3)) to which the IRS has  determined paragraph (b) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Postponement period means the period of time (up to one year)  that the IRS postpones deadlines for performing tax-related acts under  section 7508A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> will be  published as soon as practicable after the occurrence of a terroristic  or military action or declaration of a federally declared disaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The rules of this section are illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, has its  principal place of business in County M in State W. Pursuant to a timely  filed request for extension of time to file, Corporation X's 2008 Form  1120, ``U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return,'' is due on September 15,  2009. Also due on September 15, 2009, is Corporation X's third quarter  estimated tax payment for 2009. Corporation X's 2009 third quarter Form  720, ``Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return,'' and third quarter Form  941, ``Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return,'' are due on October 31,  2009. In addition, Corporation X has an employment tax deposit due on  September 15, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On September 1, 2009, a hurricane strikes County M in State W.  On September 7, 2009, certain counties in State W (including County M)  are determined to be disaster areas within the meaning of section  1033(h)(3) that are eligible for assistance by the Federal government  under the Stafford Act. Also on September 7, 2009, the IRS determines  that County M in State W is a covered disaster area and publishes  guidance announcing that the time period for affected taxpayers to file  returns, pay taxes, and perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or  after September 1, 2009, and on or before November 30, 2009, has been  postponed to November 30, 2009, pursuant to section 7508A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because Corporation X's principal place of business is in  County M, Corporation X is an affected taxpayer. Accordingly,  Corporation X's 2008 Form 1120 will be timely if filed on or before  November 30, 2009. Corporation X's 2009 third quarter estimated tax  payment will be timely if made on or before November 30, 2009. In  addition, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X's  2009 third quarter Form 720 and third quarter   Form 941 will be timely if filed on or before November 30, 2009.  However, because deposits of taxes are excluded from the scope of  paragraph (c) of this section, Corporation X's employment tax deposit is  due on September 15, 2009. In addition, Corporation X's deposits  relating to the third quarter Form 720 are not postponed. Absent  reasonable cause, Corporation X is subject to the failure to deposit  penalty under section 6656 and accrual of interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that  because of the severity of the hurricane, the IRS determines that  postponement of government acts is necessary. During 2009, Corporation  X's 2005 Form 1120 is being examined by the IRS. Pursuant to a timely  filed request for extension of time to file, Corporation X timely filed  its 2005 Form 1120 on September 15, 2006. Without application of this  section, the statute of limitation on assessment for the 2005 income tax  year will expire on September 15, 2009. However, pursuant to paragraph  (c) of this section, assessment of tax is one of the government acts for  which up to one year may be disregarded. Because September 15, 2009,  falls within the period in which government acts are postponed, the  statute of limitation on assessment for Corporation X's 2005 income tax  will expire on November 30, 2009. Because Corporation X did not timely  file an extension of time to pay, payment of its 2005 income tax was due  on March 15, 2006. As such, Corporation X will be subject to the failure  to pay penalty and related interest beginning on March 15, 2006. The due  date for payment of Corporation X's 2005 income tax preceded the  postponement period. Therefore, Corporation X is not entitled to the  suspension of interest or penalties during the disaster period with  respect to its 2005 income tax liability.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that the  examination of the 2005 taxable year was completed earlier in 2009, and  on July 28, 2009, the IRS mailed a statutory notice of deficiency to  Corporation X. Without application of this section, Corporation X has 90  days (or until October 26, 2009) to file a petition with the Tax Court.  However, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, filing a petition  with the Tax Court is one of the taxpayer acts for which a period of up  to one year may be disregarded. Because Corporation X is an affected  taxpayer, Corporation X's petition to the Tax Court will be timely if  filed on or before November 30, 2009, the last day of the postponement  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> H and W, individual calendar year taxpayers, intend  to file a joint Form 1040, ``U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,'' for  the 2008 taxable year and are required to file a Schedule H, ``Household  Employment Taxes.'' The joint return is due on April 15, 2009. H and W's  principal residence is in County M in State Q.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On April 2, 2009, a severe ice storm strikes County M. On April  5, 2009, certain counties in State Q (including County M) are determined  to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are  eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford  Act. Also on April 5, 2009, the IRS determines that County M in State Q  is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the  time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and  perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after April 2, 2009, and  on or before June 2, 2009, has been postponed to June 2, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because H and W's principal residence is in County M, H and W  are affected taxpayers. April 15, 2009, the due date for the filing of H  and W's 2008 Form 1040 and Schedule H, falls within the postponement  period described in the IRS published guidance. Thus, H and W's return  will be timely if filed on or before June 2, 2009. If H and W request an  extension of time to file under section 6081 on or before June 2, 2009,  the extension is deemed to have been filed by April 15, 2009. Thus, H  and W's return will be timely if filed on or before October 15, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> April 15, 2009, is also the due date for the payment due on the  return. This date falls within the postponement period described in the  IRS published guidance. Thus, the payment of tax due with the return  will be timely if paid on or before June 2, 2009 the last day of the  postponement period. If H and W fail to pay the tax due on the 2008 Form  1040 by June 2, 2009, and do not receive an extension of time to pay  under section 6161, H and W will be subject to failure to pay penalties  and accrual of interest beginning on June 3, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> H and W, residents of County D in State G, intend to  file an amended return to request a refund of 2008 taxes. H and W timely  filed their 2008 income tax return on April 15, 2009. Under section  6511(a), H and W's amended 2008 tax return must be filed on or before  April 16, 2012 (because April 15, 2012 falls on a Sunday, H and W's  amended return was due to be filed on April 16, 2012).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On April 2, 2012, an earthquake strikes County D. On April 6,  2012, certain counties in State G (including County D) are determined to  be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are  eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford  Act. Also on April 6, 2012, the IRS determines that County D in State G  is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the  time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and  perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after April 2, 2012, and  on or before October 2, 2012, has been postponed to October 2, 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section. Thus, if the claim is filed on or  before October 2, 2012, amounts deemed paid on April 15, 2009, under  section 6513(b), such as estimated tax and tax withheld from wages, will  have been paid within the lookback period of section 6511(b)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A is an unmarried, calendar year taxpayer whose  principal residence is located in County W in State Q. A intends to file  a Form 1040 for the 2008 taxable year. The return is due on April 15,  2009. A timely files Form 4868, ``Application for Automatic Extension of  Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.'' Due to A's timely  filing of Form 4868, the extended filing deadline for A's 2008 tax  return is October 15, 2009. Because A timely requested an extension of  time to file, A will not be subject to the failure to file penalty under  section 6651(a)(1), if A files the 2008 Form 1040 on or before October  15, 2009. However, A failed to pay the tax due on the return by April  15, 2009 and did not receive an extension of time to pay under section  6161. Absent reasonable cause, A is subject to the failure to pay  penalty under section 6651(a)(2) and accrual of interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On September 30, 2009, a blizzard strikes County W. On October  5, 2009, certain counties in State Q (including County W) are determined  to be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are  eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford  Act. Also on October 5, 2009, the IRS determines that County W in State  Q is a covered disaster area and announces that the time period for  affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and perform other time- sensitive acts falling on or after September 30, 2009, and on or before  December 2, 2009, has been postponed to December 2, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because A's principal residence is in County W, A is an  affected taxpayer. Because October 15, 2009, the extended due date to  file A's 2008 Form 1040, falls within the postponement period described  in the IRS's published guidance, A's return is timely if filed on or  before December 2, 2009. However, the payment due date, April 15, 2009,  preceded the postponement period. Thus, A will continue to be subject to  failure to pay penalties and accrual of interest during the postponement  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> H and W, individual calendar year taxpayers, intend  to file a joint Form 1040 for the 2008 taxable year. The joint return is  due on April 15, 2009. After credits for taxes withheld on wages and  estimated tax payments, H and W owe tax for the 2008 taxable year. H and  W's principal residence is in County J in State W.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On March 3, 2009, severe flooding strikes County J. On March 6,  2009, certain counties in State W (including County J) are determined to  be disaster areas within the meaning of section 1033(h)(3) that are  eligible for assistance by the Federal government under the Stafford  Act. Also on March 6, 2009, the IRS determines that County J in State W  is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the  time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and  perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after March 3, 2009, and  on or before June 1, 2009, has been postponed to June 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because H and W's principal residence is in County J, H and W  are affected taxpayers. April 15, 2009, the due date for filing the 2008  joint return, falls within the postponement period described in the IRS  published guidance. Therefore, H and W's joint return without extension  will be timely if filed on or before June 1, 2009. Similarly, H and W's  2008 income taxes will be timely paid if paid on or before June 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> On April 30, 2009, H and W timely file Form 4868, ``Application  for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax  Return.'' H and W's extension will be deemed to have been filed on April  15, 2009. Thus, H and W's 2008 income tax return will be timely if filed  on or before October 15, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> H and W did not request or receive an extension of time to pay.  Therefore, the payment of tax due with the 2008 joint return will be  timely if paid on or before June 1, 2009. If H and W fail to pay the tax  due on the 2008 joint return by June 1, 2009, H and W will be subject to  failure to pay penalties and accrual of interest beginning on June 2,  2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> H and W, individual calendar year taxpayers, entered  into an installment agreement with respect to their 2006 tax  liabilities. H and W's installment agreement required H and W to make  regularly scheduled installment payments on the 15th day of the month  for the next 60 months. H and W's principal residence is in County K in  State X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On May 1, 2009, severe flooding strikes County K. On May 5,  2009, certain counties in State X including County K) are determined by  the Federal government to be disaster areas within the meaning of  section 1033(h)(3), and are eligible for assistance under the Stafford  Act. Also on May 5, 2009, the IRS determines that County K in State X   is a covered disaster area and publishes guidance announcing that the  time period for affected taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes, and  perform other time-sensitive acts falling on or after May 1, 2009 and on  or before July 1, 2009, has been postponed to July 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because H and W's principal residence is in County K, H and W  are affected taxpayers. Pursuant to the IRS's grant of relief under  section 7508A, H and W's installment agreement payments that become due  during the postponement period are suspended until after the  postponement period has ended. H and W will be required to resume  payments no later than August 15, 2009. Skipped payments will be tacked  on at the end of the installment payment period. Because the installment  agreement pertains to prior year tax liabilities, interest and penalties  will continue to accrue. H and W may, however, be entitled to abatement  of the failure to pay penalties incurred during the postponement period  upon establishing reasonable cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date.
