Written notice of the decision of the Administrator will be mailed to the person who requested the review. A written decision will be made within 20 working days from receipt of the request for review. Extension of the time limit may be granted under the circumstances listed in Sec. 401.136(b) to the extent that the maximum 10 days limit on extensions has not been exhausted on the initial determination. The decision will include the basis for it and will advise the requester of his right to judicial review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure of the Administrator to comply with the time limits.
