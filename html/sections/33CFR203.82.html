                            <p class="depth0">It is Corps policy that provision of assistance under Public Law 84-99 will, insofar as feasible, require local interests to: provide without cost to the United States all LERRD's necessary for the authorized work; hold and save the United States free from damages due to the authorized work, exclusive of damages due to the fault or negligence of the United States or its contractor; maintain and operate, in a manner satisfactory to the Chief of Engineers, all the works after completion. When assistance includes the construction of temporary protective works, the maintain and operate clause is modified by adding (or substituting, as applicable) the requirement for local interests to remove any temporary works constructed by the Corps under Public Law 84-99. If any permanent works are constructed, then the sponsor is required to operate and maintain the project in accordance with requirements determined by the Corps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Furnishing of LERRD's. This item provides for sites of structures, for borrow and disposal areas, and for access. It also provides for all other rights in, upon, through, or over private property as needed by the United States in connection with the authorized work. Performance by the local interests under their assurance to furnish LERRD's will normally not be considered a contribution. If more advantageous to the Federal Government, borrow and disposal areas may be assumed as a Federal responsibility. Easements must be provided for future Federal inspection of maintenance or removal. If a public agency sponsors a project for a non-public applicant, the applicant must provide an easement to the sponsor for future maintenance or removal, as well as for Federal inspection. Easements should extend to the life of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hold and save clause. This clause serves as legal protection of the government. Where property concerned is under tenancy, both the property owner and the tenant should acknowledge the non-Federal sponsor's signed CA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maintain and operate clause. This item is intended to protect the investment of government resources and provide proper stewardship of resources entrusted to the Corps. This clause must include: ``It is understood that the foregoing maintenance and operation requirement extends to interrelated features of all protective work under the control of (insert name of sponsor, and owner if appropriate).''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Removal of temporary works. Local interests are responsible for the removal of all temporary works constructed by the Corps, which are unsuitable for upgrade to permanent structures. Structures may be deemed unsuitable due to inherent health, access, or safety problems that could result from their location. The wording of this clause must not preclude the use of other Federal assistance programs to fund removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Request for retention of temporary flood control works. Local interests may ask to retain a temporary structure for protection from future floods. This will not be approved by the Corps unless the works are upgraded to meet all Corps criteria for permanent projects. Public Law 84-99 funds will not be used to upgrade the structure. An upgraded project must comply with permitting, environmental, and other regulatory and legal requirements. Unless upgraded, such projects are not eligible for rehabilitation, and must be removed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Unless upgraded, temporary projects which are not removed by the local sponsor will cause all projects with the same sponsor to lose eligibility for Public Law 84-99 assistance. Local interests must initiate action to upgrade or remove the temporary works within 30 days after the flood threat has passed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cost sharing. (1) The Federal Government may assume up to 80 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control projects, and up to 100 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects. The Federal Government may assume up to 100 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of HSPP's. Sponsors will provide their share of costs as provided for in Sec. 203.84. The sponsor's share is in addition to providing costs for LERRD's, and any costs for correction of any deferred/deficient maintenance. The Corps will determine the dollar value of any in-kind services provided by the local sponsor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal Government may assume up to 80 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of non-Federal flood control projects, and up to 100 percent of the eligible construction costs for rehabilitation of Federal flood control projects.
