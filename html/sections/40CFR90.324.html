                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Vacuum side leak check. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Check any location within the  analysis system where a vacuum leak could affect the test results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum allowable leakage rate on the vacuum side is 0.5  percent of the in-use flow rate for the portion of the system being  checked. The analyzer flows and bypass flows may be used to estimate the  in-use flow rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The sample probe and the connection between the sample probe and  valve V2, see Figure 1 in Appendix B of subpart E of this part, may be  excluded from the leak check.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pressure-side leak check. Substantial leaks of the sample on the  pressure side of the system may impact sample integrity if the leaks are  of sufficient magnitude. As a safety precaution, good engineering  practice would require that manufacturers perform periodic pressure-side  leak checks of the sampling system. The recommended maximum leakage rate  on the pressure side is five percent of the in-use flow rate.  [60 FR 34598, July 3, 1995, as amended at 70 FR 40449, July 13, 2005]</p>
