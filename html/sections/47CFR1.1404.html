No  complaint filed by a cable television operator or telecommunications  carrier shall be dismissed where the utility has failed to provide the  information required under paragraphs (g), (h) or (i) of this section,  as applicable, after such reasonable request. A utility must supply a  cable television operator or telecommunications carrier the information  required in paragraph (g), (h) or (i) of this section, as applicable,  along with the supporting pages from its ARMIS, FERC Form 1, or other  report to a regulatory body, within 30 days of the request by the cable  television operator or telecommunications carrier. The cable television  operator or telecommunications carrier, in turn, shall submit these  pages with its complaint. If the utility did not supply these pages to  the cable television operator or telecommunications carrier in response  to the information request, the utility shall supply this information in  its response to the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The complaint shall include a certification that the complainant  has, in good faith, engaged or attempted to engage in executive-level  discussions with the respondent to resolve the pole attachment dispute.

Such certification shall include a statement that, prior to  the filing of the complaint, the complainant mailed a certified letter  to the respondent outlining the allegations that form the basis of the  complaint it anticipated filing with the Commission, inviting a response  within a reasonable period of time, and offering to hold executive-level  discussions regarding the dispute.
