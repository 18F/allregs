The entire carcass of swine, cattle, sheep, goats, and equines shall be condemned if any of the following conditions occur:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the lesions of tuberculosis are generalized (tuberculosis is considered to be generalized when the lesions are distributed in a manner made possible only by entry of the bacilli into the systemic circulation);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When on ante mortem inspection the animal is observed to have a fever found to be associated with an active tuberculosis lesion on post mortem inspection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When there is an associated cachexia;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a tuberculosis lesion is found in any muscle or intermuscular tissue, or bone, or joint, or abdominal organ (excluding the gastrointestinal tract) or in any lymph node as a result of draining a muscle, bone, joint, or abdominal organ (excluding the gastrointestinal tract);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When the lesions are extensive in tissues of either the thoracic or the abdominal cavity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When the lesions are multiple, acute, and actively progressive; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When the character or extent of the lesions otherwise is not indicative of a localized condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organs or other parts condemned. An organ or other part of a swine, cattle, sheep, goat, or equine carcass affected by localized tuberculosis shall be condemned when it contains lesions of tuberculosis or when the corresponding lymph node contains lesions of tuberculosis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carcasses of cattle passed without restriction for human food. Carcasses of cattle may be passed without restriction for human food only when the carcass of an animal not identified as a reactor to a tuberculin test administered by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, State, or accredited veterinarian \1\ is found free of tuberculosis lesions during postmortem inspection.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Such testing is conducted in the tuberculosis eradication program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Portions of carcasses and carcasses of cattle passed for cooking.

Swine carcasses found free of tuberculosis lesions during post mortem inspection may be passed for human food without restriction. When tuberculosis lesions in any swine carcass are localized and confined to one primary seat of infection, such as the cervical lymph nodes, the mesenteric lymph nodes, or the mediastinal lymph nodes, the unaffected portion of the carcass may be passed for human food without restriction after the affected organ or other part is condemned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Portions of carcasses of swine passed for cooking. When the carcass of any swine reveals lesions more severe or more numerous than those described in paragraph (e) of this section, but not so severe or so numerous as the lesions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the unaffected portions of such carcass may be passed for cooking in accordance with part 315 of this chapter; if the character and extent of the lesions indicate a localized condition, and if the lesions are calcified or encapsulated, and provided the affected organ or other part is condemned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines passed without restriction for human food. Carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines may be passed without restriction for human food only if found free of tuberculosis lesions during post mortem inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Portions of carcasses of sheep, goats, and equines passed for cooking.
