                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Principle. Depreciation on assets being used by a provider at  the time it enters into the Medicare program is allowed. This principle  applies even though such assets may be fully or partially depreciated on  the provider's books.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. Depreciation is allowable on assets being used at  the time the provider enters into the program. This applies even though  such assets may be fully depreciated on the provider's books or fully  depreciated with respect to other third-party payers. So long as an  asset is being used, its useful life is considered not to have ended,  and consequently the asset is subject to depreciation based upon a  revised estimate of the asset's useful life as determined by the  provider and approved by the contractor. Correction of prior years'  depreciation to reflect revision of estimated useful life should be made  in the first year of participation in the program unless the provider  has used the optional method (Sec. 413.139), in which case the  correction should be made at the time of discontinuing the use of that  method. If an asset has become fully depreciated under Medicare, further  depreciation is not appropriate or allowable, even though the asset may  continue in use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example of an allowance for a fully-depreciated asset. For  example, if a 50-year-old building is in use at the time the provider  enters into the program, depreciation is allowable on the building even  though it has been fully depreciated on the provider's books. Assuming  that a reasonable estimate of the asset's continued life is 20 years (70  years from the date of acquisition), the provider may claim depreciation  over the next 20 years--if the asset is in use that long--or a total  depreciation of as much as twenty-seventieths of the asset's historical  cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Corrections to depreciation. If the asset is disposed of before  the expiration of its estimated useful life, the depreciation would be  adjusted to the actual useful life. Likewise, a provider may not have  fully depreciated other   assets it is using and finds that it has incorrectly estimated the  useful lives of those assets. In such cases, the provider may use the  corrected useful lives in determining the amount of depreciation,  provided such corrections have been approved by the contractor.</p>
