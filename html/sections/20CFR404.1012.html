                            <p class="depth0">Certain kinds of work performed by an employee are excluded from  employment. They are described in Secs. 404.1014 through 404.1038 and  are exceptions to the general rule in Sec. 404.1004 on the kinds of work  that are covered as employment. In general, if the work performed by an  employee is excluded from employment, the work is not covered under  social security. However, certain kinds of work performed by an  employee, even though excluded from employment, are covered as self- employment for social security purposes. In addition, if part of the  work performed by an employee for the same employer is included as  employment and part is excluded from employment,   all the work may be included or all may be excluded as described in  Sec. 404.1013.
