                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purposes of this part, the definitions for the terms  ``contract,'' ``contractor'', ``Government contract,'' ``subcontract,''  and ``subcontractor'' are the same as those set forth in 41 CFR part 60- 300.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran means a veteran  who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air  service during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign  badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department  of Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Armed Forces service medal veteran means a veteran who, while  serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air  service, participated in a United States military operation for which an  Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985  (61 FR 1209, 3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 159).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Disabled veteran means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who  is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military  retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered  by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A person who was discharged or released from active duty  because of a service-connected disability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Electronic filing or ``e-filing'' means filing the VETS-4212  Report via the VETS web-based filing system. E-filing   also includes transmitting or delivering the VETS-4212 Report as an  electronic data file. Instructions for electronically filing the VETS- 4212 Report are found on VETS' Web site at: http://www.dol.gov/vets/ vets100filing.htm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employee means any individual on the payroll of an employer who  is an employee for purposes of the employer's withholding of Social  Security taxes except insurance sales agents who are considered to be  employees for such purposes solely because of the provisions of 26  U.S.C. 3121 (d)(3)(B) (the Internal Revenue Code). Leased employees are  included in this definition. Leased employee means a permanent employee  provided by an employment agency for a fee to an outside company for  which the employment agency handles all personnel tasks including  payroll, staffing, benefit payments and compliance reporting. The  employment agency shall, therefore, include leased employees in its  VETS-4212 Report. The term employee shall not include persons who are  hired on a casual basis for a specified time, or for the duration of a  specified job (for example, persons at a construction site whose  employment relationship is expected to terminate with the end of the  employee's work at the site); persons temporarily employed in any  industry other than construction, such as temporary office workers,  mariners, stevedores, lumber yard workers, etc., who are hired through a  hiring hall or other referral arrangement, through an employee  contractor or agent, or by some individual hiring arrangement, or  persons (except leased employees) on the payroll of an employment agency  who are referred by such agency for work to be performed on the premises  of another employer under that employer's direction and control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Hiring location (this definition is identical to establishment  as defined by the instructions for completing Employer Information  Report EEO-1, Standard Form 100 (EEO-1 Report)) means an economic unit  which produces goods or services, such as a factory, office, store, or  mine. In most instances the establishment is at a single physical  location and is engaged in one, or predominantly one, type of economic  activity. Units at different locations, even though engaged in the same  kind of business operation, should be reported as separate  establishments. For locations involving construction, transportation,  communications, electric, gas, and sanitary services, oil and gas  fields, and similar types of physically dispersed industrial activities,  however, it is not necessary to list separately each individual site,  project, field, line, etc., unless it is treated by the contractor as a  separate legal entity. For these physically dispersed activities, list  as establishments only those relatively permanent main or branch  offices, terminals, stations, etc., which are either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directly responsible for supervising such dispersed activities;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The base from which personnel and equipment operate to carry  out these activities. (Where these dispersed activities cross State  lines, at least one such establishment should be listed for each State  involved).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Job category means any of the following: Officials and managers  (Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers and First/Mid-Level  Officials and Managers), professionals, technicians, sales workers,  administrative support workers, craft workers, operatives, laborers and  helpers, and service workers, as required by the EEO-1 Report, as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Officials and managers as a whole are to be divided into the  following two subcategories: Executive/Senior Level Officials and  Managers and First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers means individuals,  who plan, direct and formulate policies, set strategy and provide the  overall direction of enterprises/organizations for the development and  delivery of products and services, within the parameters approved by  boards of directors of other governing bodies.

These managers receive directions  from Executive/Senior Level management and typically lead major business  units.

Examples of these  kinds of managers are: Vice presidents and directors; group, regional or  divisional controllers; treasurers; and human resources, information  systems, marketing, and operations managers.

Examples of these   types of positions include: boilermakers; brick and stone masons;  carpenters; electricians; painters (both construction and maintenance);  glaziers; pipe layers, plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters;  plasterers; roofers; elevator installers; earth drillers; derrick  operators; oil and gas rotary drill operators; and blasters and  explosive workers. This category also includes occupations related to  the installation, maintenance and part replacement of equipment,  machines and tools, such as: automotive mechanics; aircraft mechanics;  and electric and electronic equipment repairers. This category also  includes some production occupations that are distinguished by the high  degree of skill and precision required to perform them, based on clearly  defined task specifications, such as: millwrights; etchers and  engravers; tool and die makers; and pattern makers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Operatives means individuals in intermediate skilled  occupations and includes workers who operate machines or factory-related  processing equipment. Most of these occupations do not usually require  more than several months of training. Examples include: textile machine  workers; laundry and dry cleaning workers; photographic process workers;  weaving machine operators; electrical and electronic equipment  assemblers; semiconductor processors; testers, graders and sorters;  bakers; and butchers and other meat, poultry and fish processing  workers. This category also includes occupations of generally  intermediate skill levels that are concerned with operating and  controlling equipment to facilitate the movement of people or materials,  such as: bridge and lock tenders; truck, bus or taxi drivers; industrial  truck and tractor (forklift) operators; parking lot attendants; sailors;  conveyor operators; and hand packers and packagers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Laborers and helpers means individuals with more limited  skills who require only brief training to perform tasks that require  little or no independent judgment.
