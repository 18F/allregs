                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> but which qualify for one  of the exceptions set forth in section 79(b) are described in paragraphs  (b) through (d) of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section discusses  the exception provided in section 79(b) </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>; paragraph (c) of this  section discusses the exception provided in section 79(b)(2); and  paragraph (d) of this section discusses the exception provided in  section 79(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a policy of group-term life insurance qualifies for an  exception provided by section 79(b), then the amount equal to the cost  of such insurance is excluded from the application of the provisions of  section 79(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a policy, or portion of a policy of group-term life  insurance qualifies for an exception provided by section 79(b), the  amount (if any) paid by the employee toward the purchase of such  insurance is not to be taken into account as an amount referred to in  section 79 (a)(2). In the case of a policy or policies of group-term  life insurance which qualify for an exception provided by section 79(b)  (1) or (3), the amount paid by the employee which is not to be taken  into account as an amount referred to in section 79(a) (2) is the amount  paid by the employee for the particular policy or policies of group-term  life insurance which qualify for an exception provided under such  section. If the exception provided in section 79(b)(2) is applicable  only to a portion of the group-term life insurance   on the employee's life, the amount considered to be paid by the employee  toward the purchase of such portion is the amount equal to the excess of  the cost of such portion of the insurance over the amount otherwise  includible in the employee's gross income with respect to the group-term  life insurance on his life carried directly or indirectly by such  employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The rules of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A is an employee of X Corporation and is also an employee  of Y Corporation, a subsidiary of X Corporation. A is provided, under a  separate plan arranged by each of his employers, group-term life  insurance on his life. During his taxable year, under the group-term  life insurance plan of X Corporation, A is provided $60,000 of group- term life insurance on his life, and A pays $360.00 toward the purchase  of such insurance. Under the group-term life insurance plan of Y  Corporation, A is provided $65,000 of group-term life insurance on his  life, but does not pay any part of the cost of such insurance. At the  beginning of his taxable year, A terminates his employment with the X  Corporation after he has reached the retirement age with respect to such  employer, and the policy carried by the X Corporation qualifies for the  exception provided by section 79(b)(1). For that taxable year, the cost  of the group-term life insurance on A's life which is provided under the  plan of X Corporation is not taken into account in determining the  amount includible in A's gross income under section 79(a), and A may not  take into account as an amount described in section 79(a)(2) the $360.00  he pays toward the purchase of such insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> applies only to the portion of the cost of group-term life  insurance which is provided subsequent to the happening of the last  event which qualifies the policy of insurance on the employee's life for  the exception provided in such section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Termination of employment. For purposes of section 79(b)(1), an  individual has terminated his employment with an employer providing such  individual group-term life insurance when such individual no longer  renders services to that employer as an employee of such employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Retirement age. For purposes of section 79(b)(1) and this  section, the meaning of the term ``retirement age'' is determined in  accordance with the following rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(a)</em> If the employee is covered under a written pension or annuity  plan of the employer providing such individual group-term life insurance  on his life (whether or not such plan is qualified under section 401(a)  or 403(a)), then his retirement age shall be considered to be the  earlier of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The earliest age indicated by such plan at which an active  employee has the right (or an inactive individual would have the right  had he continued in employment) to retire without disability and without  the consent of his employer and receive immediate retirement benefits  computed at either the full rate or a rate proportionate to completed  service as set forth in the normal retirement formula of the plan, i.e.,  without actuarial or similar reduction because of retirement before some  later specified age, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The age at which it has been the practice of the employer to  terminate, due to age, the services of the class of employees to which  he last belonged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of (a) of this subdivision, if an employee is  covered under more than one pension or annuity plan of the employer, his  retirement age shall be determined with regard to that   plan which covers that class of employees of the employer to which the  employee last belonged. If the class of employees to which the employee  last belonged is covered under more than one pension or annuity plan,  then the employee's retirement age shall be determined with regard to  that plan which covers the greatest number of the employer's employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the absence of a written employee's pension or annuity plan  described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, retirement age is the  age, if any, at which it has been the practice of the employer to  terminate, due to age, the services of the class of employees to which  the particular employee last belonged, provided such age is reasonable  in view of all the pertinent facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If neither subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph  applies, the retirement age is considered to be age 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Disabled. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31,  1966, an individual is considered disabled for purposes of section  79(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph if he is disabled within  the meaning of section 72(m)(7) and paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.72-17. For  taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, an individual is  considered disabled for purposes of section 79(b)(1) and subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph if he is disabled within the meaning of section  213(g)(3), relating to the meaning of disabled, but the determination of  the individual's status shall be made without regard to the provisions  of section 213(g)(4), relating to the determination of status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(a)</em> In any taxable year in which an individual seeks to apply  the exception set forth in section 79(b)(1) by reason of his being  disabled within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and  in which the aggregate amount of insurance on the individual's life  subject to the rule of inclusion set forth in section 79(a), but  determined without regard to the amount of any insurance subject to any  exception set forth in section 79(b), is greater than $50,000 of such  insurance, the substantiation required by (b) or (c) of this subdivision  must be submitted with the individual's tax return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> by reason of his being  disabled within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph,  there must be submitted with his income tax return a doctor's statement  as to his impairment. There must also be submitted with the return a  statement by the individual with respect to the effect of the impairment  upon his substantial gainful activity, and the date such impairment  occurred. For subsequent taxable years, the taxpayer may, in lieu of  such statements, submit a statement declaring the continued existence  (without substantial diminution) of the impairment and its continued  effect upon his substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In lieu of the substantiation required to be submitted by (b) of  this subdivision for the taxable year, the individual may submit a  signed statement issued to him by the insurer to the effect that the  individual is disabled within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this  paragraph. Such statement must set forth the basis for the insurer's  determination that the individual was so disabled, and, for the first  taxable year in which the individual is so disabled, the date such  disability occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employer or charity a beneficiary--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Section  79(b)(2) provides an exception with respect to the amounts referred to  in section 79 (a) for the cost of any portion of the group-term life  insurance on the life of an employee provided during part or all of the  taxable year of the employee under which the employer is directly or  indirectly the beneficiary, or under which a person described in section  170(c) (relating to definition of charitable contributions) is the sole  beneficiary, for the entire period during such taxable year for which  the employee receives such insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the determination of whether the  employer is directly or indirectly the beneficiary under a policy or  policies of group-term life insurance depends upon the facts and  circumstances of the particular case. Such determination is not   made solely with regard to whether the employer possesses all the  incidents of ownership in the policy. Thus, for example, if the employer  is the nominal beneficiary under a policy of group-term life insurance  on the life of his employee but there is an arrangement whereby the  employer is required to pay over all (or a portion) of the proceeds of  such policy to the employee's estate or his beneficiary, the employer is  not considered a beneficiary under such policy (or such portion of the  policy).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Charity a beneficiary. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of section 79(b)(2) and  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a person described in section 170(c)  is a beneficiary under a policy providing group-term life insurance if  such person is designated the beneficiary under the policy by any  assignment or designation of beneficiary under the policy which, under  the law of the jurisdiction which is applicable to the policy, has the  effect of making such person the beneficiary under such policy (whether  or not such designation is revocable during the taxable year). Such a  designation may be made by the employee with respect to any portion of  the group-term life insurance on his life. However, no deduction is  allowed under section 170, relating to charitable, etc., contributions  and gifts, with respect to any such assignment or designation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A person described in section 170(c) must be designated the  sole beneficiary under the policy or portion of the policy. Such  requirement is satisfied if the person described in section 170(c) is  the beneficiary under such policy or portion of the policy, and there is  no contingent or similar beneficiary under such policy or such portion  other than a person described in section 170(c). A general ``preference  beneficiary clause'' in a policy governing payment where there is no  designated beneficiary in existence at the death of the employee will  not of itself be considered to create a contingent or similar  beneficiary. A person described in section 170(c) may be designated the  beneficiary under a portion of the policy if such person is designated  the sole beneficiary under a beneficiary designation which is expressed,  for example, as a fraction of the amount of insurance on the insured's  life.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a person described in section 170(c) is designated, before  May 1, 1964, the beneficiary under the policy (or portion thereof) and  such person remains the beneficiary for the period beginning May 1,  1964, and ending with the close of the first taxable year of the  employee ending after April 30, 1964, such person shall be treated as  the beneficiary under the policy (or the portion thereof) for the period  beginning January 1, 1964, and ending April 30, 1964.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Insurance contracts purchased under qualified employee plans.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 79(b)(3) provides an exception with respect to the cost of  any group-term life insurance which is provided under a life insurance  contract purchased as a part of a plan described in section 403(a), or  purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from  tax under section 501(a) if the proceeds of such contract are payable  directly or indirectly to a participant in such trust or to a  beneficiary of such participant. The provisions of section 72(m)(3) and  Sec. 1.72-16 apply to the cost of such group-term life insurance, and,  therefore, no part of such cost is excluded from the gross income of the  employee by reason of the provisions of section 79.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the life insurance protection on an employee's life is  provided under a qualified employee plan referred to in subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph depends upon the provisions of such plan. In  determining whether a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or annuity  plan satisfies the requirements for qualification set forth in sections  401(a) or 403(a), only group-term life insurance which is provided under  such plan is taken into account.
