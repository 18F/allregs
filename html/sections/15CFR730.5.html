                            <p class="depth0">The core of the export control provisions of the EAR concerns  exports from the United States. You will find, however, that some  provisions give broad meaning to the term ``export'', apply to  transactions outside of the United States, or apply to activities other  than exports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reexports. Commodities, software, and technology that have been  exported from the United States are generally subject to the EAR with  respect to reexport. Many such reexports, however, may go to many  destinations without a license or will qualify for an exception from  licensing requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foreign products. In some cases, authorization to export  technology from the United States will be subject to assurances that  items produced abroad that are the direct product of that technology  will not be exported to certain destinations without authorization from  BIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope of ``exports''. Certain actions that you might not regard  as an ``export'' in other contexts do constitute an export subject to  the EAR. The release of technology to a foreign national in the United  States through such means as demonstration or oral briefing is deemed an  export. Other examples of exports under the EAR include the return of  foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair in the United  States, shipments from a U.S. foreign trade zone, and the electronic  transmission of non-public data that will be received abroad.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> U.S. person activities. To counter the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction, the EAR restrict the involvement of ``United States  persons'' anywhere in the world in exports of foreign-origin items, or  in providing services or support, that may contribute to such  proliferation.
