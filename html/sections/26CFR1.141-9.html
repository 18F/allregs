                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rules--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Description of test. Under section 141(b)(3)  (the unrelated or disproportionate use test), an issue meets the private  business tests if the amount of private business use and private  security or payments attributable to unrelated or disproportionate  private business use exceeds 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue. For  this purpose, the private business use test is applied by taking into  account only use that is not related to any government use of proceeds  of the issue (unrelated use) and use that is related but  disproportionate to any government use of those proceeds  (disproportionate use).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of unrelated or disproportionate use test--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Order  of application. The unrelated or disproportionate use test is applied by  first determining whether a private business use is related to a  government use. Next, private business use that relates to a government  use is examined to determine whether it is disproportionate to that  government use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation of unrelated and disproportionate use. All the  unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with the proceeds of an  issue are aggregated to determine compliance with the unrelated or  disproportionate use test. The amount of permissible unrelated and  disproportionate private business use is not reduced by the amount of  private business use financed with the proceeds of an issue that is  neither unrelated use nor disproportionate use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Deliberate actions. A deliberate action that occurs after the  issue date does not result in unrelated or disproportionate use if the  issue meets the conditions of Sec. 1.141-12(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unrelated use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Whether a private business use is  related to a government use financed with the proceeds of an issue is  determined on a case-by-case basis, emphasizing the operational  relationship between the government use and the private business use. In  general, a facility that is used for a related private business use must  be located within, or adjacent to, the governmentally used facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use for the same purpose as government use. Use of a facility by  a nongovernmental person for the same purpose as use by a governmental  person is not treated as unrelated use if the government use is not  insignificant. Similarly, a use of a facility in the same manner both  for private business use that is related use and private business use  that is unrelated use does not result in unrelated use if the related  use is not insignificant. For example, a privately owned pharmacy in a  governmentally owned hospital does not ordinarily result in unrelated  use solely because the pharmacy also serves individuals not using the  hospital. In addition, use of parking spaces in a garage by a  nongovernmental person is not treated as unrelated use if more than an  insignificant portion of the parking spaces are used for a government  use (or a private business use that is related to a government use),  even though the use by the nongovernmental person is not directly  related to that other use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disproportionate use--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition of disproportionate use. A  private business use is disproportionate to a related government use  only to the extent that the amount of proceeds used for that private  business use exceeds the amount of proceeds used for the related  government use. For example, a private use of $100 of proceeds that is  related to a government use of $70 of proceeds results in $30 of  disproportionate use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aggregation of related uses. If two or more private business  uses of the proceeds of an issue relate to a single government use of  those proceeds, those private business uses are aggregated to apply the  disproportionate use test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allocation rule. If a private business use relates to more than  a single use of the proceeds of the issue (for example, two or more  government uses of the proceeds of the issue or a government use and a  private use), the amount of any disproportionate use may be determined  by--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reasonably allocating the proceeds used for the private business  use among the related uses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregating government uses that are directly related to each  other; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Allocating the private business use to the government use to  which it is primarily related.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maximum use taken into account. The determination of the amount  of unrelated use or disproportionate use of a facility is based on the  maximum amount of reasonably expected government use of a facility  during the measurement period. Thus, no unrelated use or  disproportionate use arises solely because a facility initially has  excess capacity that is to be used by a nongovernmental person if the  facility will be completely used by the issuer during the term of the  issue for more than an insignificant period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. School and remote cafeteria. County X issues bonds with  proceeds of $20 million and uses $18.1 million of the proceeds for  construction of a new school building and $1.9 million of the proceeds  for construction of a privately operated cafeteria in its administrative  office building, which is located at a remote site. The bonds are  secured, in part, by the cafeteria. The $1.9 million of proceeds is  unrelated to the government use (that is, school construction) financed  with the bonds and exceeds 5 percent of $20 million. Thus, the issue  meets the private business tests.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Public safety building and courthouse. City Y issues  bonds with proceeds of $50 million for construction of a new public  safety building ($32 million) and for improvements to an existing  courthouse ($15 million). Y uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for  renovations to an existing privately operated cafeteria located in the  courthouse. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria. Y's use of  the $3 million for the privately operated cafeteria does not meet the  unrelated or disproportionate use test because these expenditures are  neither unrelated use nor disproportionate use.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Unrelated garage. City Y issues bonds with proceeds of  $50 million for construction of a new public safety building ($30.5  million) and for improvements to an existing courthouse ($15 million). Y  uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for renovations to an existing  privately operated cafeteria located in the courthouse. The bonds are  secured, in part, by the cafeteria. Y also uses $1.5 million of the  proceeds to construct a privately operated parking garage adjacent to a  private office building. The private business use of the parking garage  is unrelated to any government use of proceeds of the issue. Since the  proceeds used for unrelated uses and disproportionate uses do not exceed  5 percent of the proceeds, the unrelated or disproportionate use test is  not met.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Disproportionate use of garage. County Z issues bonds  with proceeds of $20 million for construction of a hospital with no  private business use ($17 million); renovation of an office building  with no private business use ($1 million); and construction of a garage  that is entirely used for a private business use ($2 million). The use  of the garage is related to the use of the office building but not to  the use of the hospital. The private business use of the garage results  in $1 million of disproportionate use because the proceeds used for the  garage ($2 million) exceed the proceeds used for the related government  use ($1 million). The bonds are not private activity bonds, however,  because the disproportionate use does not exceed 5 percent of the  proceeds of the issue.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> County W issues bonds  with proceeds of $80 million for the following purposes: (1) $72 million  to construct a County-owned and operated waste incinerator; (2) $1  million for a County-owned and operated facility for the temporary  storage of hazardous waste prior to final disposal; (3) $1 million to  construct a privately owned recycling facility located at a remote site;  and (4) $6 million to build a garage adjacent to the County-owned  incinerator that will be leased to Company T to store and repair trucks  that it owns and uses to haul County W refuse. Company T uses 75 percent  of its trucks to haul materials to the incinerator and the remaining 25  percent of its trucks to haul materials to the temporary storage  facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The $1 million of proceeds used for the recycling facility is  used for an unrelated use. The garage is related use. In addition, 75  percent of the use of the $6 million of proceeds used for the garage is  allocable to the government use of proceeds at the incinerator. The  remaining 25 percent of the proceeds used for the garage ($1.5 million)  relates to the government use of proceeds at the temporary storage  facility. Thus, this portion of the proceeds used for the garage exceeds  the proceeds used for the temporary storage facility by $0.5 million and  this excess is disproportionate use (but not unrelated use). Thus, the  aggregate amount of unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with  the proceeds of the issue is $1.5 million. Alternatively, under  paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the entire garage may be treated  as related to the government use of the incinerator and, under that  allocation, the garage is not disproportionate use. In either event,  section 141(b)(3) limits the aggregate unrelated use and  disproportionate use to $4 million. Therefore, the bonds are not private  activity bonds under this section.
