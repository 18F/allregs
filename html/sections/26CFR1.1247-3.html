                                Sec. 1.1247-3  Treatment of capital gains.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(B)</em>. Except  as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the company shall  compute such excess (hereinafter referred to as excess capital gains) as  if such company were a domestic corporation, but without regard to  subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code. See paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.1247-1  for rules relating to termination of election under section 1247(a) for  failure to properly compute or to properly designate excess capital  gains. A company may make an irrevocable election (by notifying its  shareholders as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) to  distribute, on or before the 45th day following the close of its taxable  year, all or a portion of the excess capital gains and have any such  distribution treated as if made during such taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(C)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice to shareholders. The company shall designate by written  notice, mailed on or before the 45th day following the close of its  taxable year:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To each person who is a shareholder at the close of such taxable  year, his pro rata amount of the portion of the excess capital gains for  such year which was not distributed, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To each person who received a distribution of excess capital  gains with respect to such taxable year, the amount and the date of each  such distribution.  Each notice shall show the name and address of the foreign investment  company and the taxable year of the company for which the designation is  made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Treatment of capital gains by qualified shareholder--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Definition of qualified shareholder. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term qualified shareholder  means any shareholder of a registered foreign investment company who is  a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), other than a  shareholder described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A United States person shall not be treated as a qualified  shareholder for a taxable year if in his return for such taxable year  (or for any prior taxable year) he did not include, in computing his  long-term capital gains, his   pro rata amount of the undistributed portion of the excess capital gains  which the company designated for its taxable year ending within or with  such taxable year of the shareholder. Thus, for example, if a  shareholder fails to include as long-term capital gain in his return for  his taxable year ending December 31, 1966, the amount designated by the  company as his pro rata amount of undistributed excess capital gains for  the company's taxable year ending June 30, 1966, he would not be a  qualified shareholder for his taxable year ending December 31, 1966, or  for any subsequent taxable year. However, if the shareholder can show  that his failure to include his pro rata amount of the undistributed  portion of the excess capital gains in his return was due to reasonable  cause and not due to willful neglect, he will continue to be a qualified  shareholder. Such shareholder shall, for the year with respect to which  such failure occurred, include in his taxable income his previously  omitted pro rata amount of the undistributed portion of excess capital  gains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of excess capital gains. A qualified shareholder of a  foreign investment company, for any taxable year of the company for  which the election under section 1247(a) is in effect, shall include in  his return in computing his long-term capital gains:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For his taxable year in which received, his pro rata amount of  the distributed portion of the excess capital gains for such taxable  year of the company, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For his taxable year in which or with which the taxable year of  the company ends, his pro rata amount of the undistributed portion of  the excess capital gains for such taxable year of the company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sales at end of company's taxable year. For purposes of  determining whether the purchaser or seller of a share of foreign  investment company stock is the shareholder at the close of such  company's taxable year who is required to include an amount of  undistributed excess capital gains in gross income, the amount of the  undistributed excess capital gains shall be treated in the same manner  as a cash dividend payable to shareholders of record at the close of the  company's taxable year. Thus, if a cash dividend paid to shareholders of  record as of the close of the foreign investment company's taxable year  would be considered income to the purchaser, then the purchaser is also  considered to be the shareholder of such company at the close of its  taxable year for purposes of including an amount of undistributed excess  capital gains in gross income. For rules for determining whether a  dividend is income to the purchaser or seller of a share of stock, see  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.61-9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Partners and partnerships. If the shareholder required to  include an amount of undistributed excess capital gains in gross income  under section 1247(d)(2) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph is a  partnership, such amount shall be taken into account by the partnership  for the taxable year of the partnership in which occurs the last day of  the taxable year of the foreign investment company in respect of which  the undistributed portion of the excess capital gains were designated.  The amount so includible by the partnership shall be taken into account  by the partners as distributive shares of the partnership gains and  losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets held for more than 1  year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for  taxable years beginning in 1977) pursuant to section 702(a)(2) and  paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.702-1. The partners shall increase the basis  of their partnership interests under section 705(a)(1) by their  distributive shares of such gains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Effect on earnings and profits of corporate shareholder. If a  shareholder required to include an amount of undistributed excess  capital gains in gross income under section 1247(d)(2) and subparagraph  (2)(ii) of this paragraph is a corporation, such corporation, in  computing its earnings and profits for the taxable year for which such  amount is so includible, shall treat such amount as if it had actually  been received in that year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example: Smith owns one share of stock in a foreign investment  company which he purchased in 1964. In respect of the company's taxable  year ending June 30, 1966, during which the election under section  1247(a) was in effect, Smith receives from the company on July 15, 1966,  a distribution in the amount of $8. He also receives a notice stating  that for such taxable year $9 was being designated as his pro rata  amount of the excess capital gains, $8 of which was distributed on July  15, 1966, and $1 of which was being designated as the undistributed  portion. In order for Smith to be a qualified shareholder for his  taxable year ending December 31, 1966, he must include in computing his  long-term capital gains in his return for 1966, his pro rata amount of  the undistributed portion of the excess capital gains, that is, $1.  Smith must also include in such return his pro rata amount of the  distributed portion of excess capital gains, that is, $8. If, however,  Smith does not include in income his pro rata amount of the  undistributed portion of excess capital gains, he is not a qualified  shareholder for 1966 (or for any subsequent year). In such a case, the  $8 is not treated under the provisions of section 1247(d)(1) as a  distribution of long-term capital gains for such year but as a corporate  distribution taxable as ordinary income to the extent provided in  subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustments relating to undistributed capital gains--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Adjustments in earnings and profits of the company. If a foreign  investment company, to which the election under section 1247(a) applies,  designates an amount as the undistributed portion of excess capital  gains for its taxable year, the earnings and profits of the company  (within the meaning of subchapter C, chapter 1 of the Code) shall be  reduced, and its capital account shall be increased, by such amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Increase in basis of qualified shareholder's stock. A qualified  shareholder, who computes his long-term capital gains for a taxable year  by including (in respect of each share of stock which he owns in a  foreign investment company) the pro rata amount of the undistributed  portion of the excess capital gains which was designated by the company  for its taxable year ending with or within such taxable year of the  shareholder, shall, as of the day following the close of such taxable  year of the company, increase the adjusted basis of each share by such  pro rata amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Loss on sale or exchange of certain stock held 1 year or less-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A qualified shareholder of a foreign investment company to which  the election under section 1247(a) applies treats any amount designated  under section 1247(a)(1)(B) with respect to a share of stock as long- term capital gain, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such share is held by the taxpayer for 1 year (6 months for  taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years  beginning in 1977) or less,  Then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent  of the amount described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, be  treated under section 1247(i) as loss from the sale or exchange of a  capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years  beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth3">Example: On October 1, 1966, B, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases  for $100 a share of stock in a foreign investment company to which the  election under section 1247(a) applies. On January 20, 1967, the  company, in a notice to B, designates for its taxable year ending  December 31, 1966, $8 per share as excess capital gains of which $6 was  distributed on December 1, 1966, and $2 was designated as undistributed.  B includes the $8 in computing his long-term capital gains in his return  for 1966 and, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, B's basis for the  share is increased to $102 as of January 1, 1967. On February 1, 1967, B  sells the share for $93, incurring a $9 loss of which $8 is treated as a  long-term capital loss under section 1247(i) and $1 is treated as a  short-term capital loss.  [T.D. 6798, 30 FR 1175, Feb. 4, 1965, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR  72650, Nov. 3, 1980]</p>
