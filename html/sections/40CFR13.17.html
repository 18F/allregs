                            <p class="depth0">When collecting statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts for purposes of enforcement or compelling compliance, the Administrator may suspend or revoke licenses or other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure of a debtor to pay a claim. Additionally, the Administrator may suspend or disqualify any contractor, lender, broker, borrower, grantee or other debtor from doing business with EPA or engaging in programs EPA sponsors or funds if a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time. Debtors will be notified before such action is taken and applicable suspension or debarment procedures will be used. The Administrator will report the failure of any surety to honor its obligations to the Treasury Department for action under 6 U.S.C. 11.</p>
