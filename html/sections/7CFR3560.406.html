                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The provisions of this section apply to ownership  transfers or sales (e.g., title transfers) involving an Agency financed  housing project. The provisions cover situations where Agency loans are  being assumed as a part of a housing project transfer or sale.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agency consent requirements. Agency consent must be obtained  prior to an ownership transfer or sale and Agency consent will only be  given when the transfer or sale is in the best interest of the Federal  Government. Any ownership transfer or sale without the consent of the  Agency will be considered a default and will be handled in accordance  with subpart J of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Priority consideration will be given to ownership transfers or  sales needed to remove a hardship to the borrower that was caused by  circumstances beyond the borrower's control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ownership transfers or sales with an assumption of debt at an  amount less than the borrower's debt amount will only be approved by the  Agency when all persons in the borrower entity who are transferring  their ownership interest or are involved in the selling of the property  are not part of the transferee organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consent request requirements. Borrowers must submit written  requests for Agency consent to an ownership transfer or sale of a  housing project to the Agency at least 45 days prior to proposed  ownership transfer or sale date. The consent request must document that  the proposed transfer or sale meets the requirements of paragraph (d) of  this section and must include the following items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement disclosing any identity-of-interest between the  borrower and the party to which the housing project ownership is being  transferred or sold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement certifying that the housing project's financial  accounts are funded at required levels, less authorized withdrawals, and  that payments due for operation and maintenance expenses, tax  assessments, insurance premiums, any required tenant security deposit  accounts, and other obligations incurred as a part of the housing  project operations are paid in full with no overdue balances or a  statement explaining the housing project's financial situation and the  reasons for overdue payments or under funded accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A proposed housing project budget covering the partial year, if  applicable, and first full year operation following the ownership  transfer or housing project sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A written statement, signed by the proposed transferee or buyer,  certifying that the transferee or buyer will assume the borrower  responsibilities and obligations specified in Agency program  requirements including requirements in a promissory note, loan agreement  or other documents related to Agency loans held by the borrower entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A certification from the borrower and the proposed transferee or  buyer that the borrower does not and will not have a reversionary  interest in the housing project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requirements for ownership transfers or sales. An ownership  transfer or sale of a housing project with an assumption of Agency loans  by the transferee or buyer must comply with the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferee or buyer must be an eligible borrower under the  requirements established by subpart B of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transferee or buyer must agree to set basic rents at the  housing project covered by the assumed loans at levels that do no exceed  conventional rents for comparable units in the area, except that when  determined necessary by the Agency to allow for decent, safe and  sanitary housing to be provided in market areas where conventional rents  are not sufficient to cover necessary operating, maintenance, and  reserve costs. Basic rents may be allowed to exceed comparable rents for  conventional units, but in no case by more than 150% of the comparable  rent for conventional unit rent level; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The value of the housing project covered by the loans to be  assumed, at the time of an ownership transfer or sale, must be  sufficient to ensure that all Agency loans being assumed and all  subsequent loans being offered as a part of the transfer or sale can be  secured to a level that fully protects the Agency's interest. Loans from  third-party sources that are not dependent on project revenue for  payment will not be included in this determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the total value of the loans being offered as a part of an  ownership transfer or sale is $100,000 or less, the   security value of the housing project may be determined through either:  An Agency review of monitoring reports conducted in accordance with the  requirements in subpart H of this part or an appraisal paid for by the  borrower and conducted in accordance with subpart P of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the total value of the loans being offered as a part of an  ownership transfer or sale exceeds $100,000, the security value of the  housing project must be determined through an appraisal obtained by the  Agency and conducted in accordance with subpart P of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Agency may approve a loan write-down, in accordance with  Sec. 3560.455, prior to an ownership transfer or sale to reduce the  amount of debt being assumed by the transferee or buyer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prior to Agency approval of an ownership transfer or sale, an  environmental review, as required under the National Environmental  Policy Act and in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, must be  conducted on all property related to the ownership transfer or sale. If  contamination from hazardous substances or petroleum products is found  on the property, the finding must be disclosed to the Agency and the  transferee or buyer and must be taken into consideration in the  determination of the housing project's value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All immediate and long-term repair and rehabilitation needs must  be identified by a capital needs assessment. The reserve requirements  for the housing project will be reviewed by the Agency and adjusted, if  necessary, to adequately cover the cost of addressing the property's  capital needs. The Agency may approve the release of the current reserve  amount to the transferor provided the transferee agrees to deposit the  amount to cover the project's immediate needs into the reserve account  at closing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The borrower and transferee must disclose to the Agency all  terms, conditions, or other considerations related to the ownership  transfer or sale. All side or other agreements must be disclosed and all  sources and uses of funds related to the ownership transfer or sale must  be disclosed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> An agreement must be signed between the borrower and the  transferee listing all repairs known by the borrower to be necessary to  bring the housing project into compliance with Agency requirements for  decent, safe, and sanitary housing as listed in subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agreement must include repairs required to correct  compliance violations cited in a compliance violation notice issued by  the Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agreement must specify whether each repair listed will be  completed by the borrower prior to the ownership transfer or by the  transferee in accordance with a workout agreement developed in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 3560.453 and executed between  the transferee or buyer and the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A civil rights compliance review, as required by 7 CFR part  1901, subpart E, will be conducted by the Agency prior to the ownership  transfer or sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> During or immediately after the transfer, a review of the  property must be conducted to ensure that it complies with or will  comply with section 504(c) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),  which covers accessibility requirements, and the Title VI of the Fair  Housing Act of 1968.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> A transferee must ensure that tenant certifications in  compliance with subpart D of this part for all occupied rental units are  on file with the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> A transferee must comply with insurance and bonding  requirements established in subpart C of this part at the time of the  transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> A transferee must agree to submit financial reports to the  Agency according to subpart G of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> A transferee must establish that there are no liens, judgments,  or other claims against the housing project other than those by the  Agency and those to which the Agency has previously agreed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> A limited profit Rural Rental Housing transferee's initial  investment and return on investment will remain the same as that  originally provided to the transferor unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The property is transferred to a non-profit entity and the  return on investment is eliminated; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The transferee contributes additional funds for repair or  rehabilitation and the Agency agrees to recognize a higher initial  investment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Equity payments. The Agency will withhold any equity payment due  to the borrower, as part of an ownership transfer or sale, if any of the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The borrower's indebtedness to the Agency has not been paid in  full or is not being assumed by the transferee. The Agency will require  that all or part of an equity payment be applied against other Agency  loans owed by the borrower if payments on the other loans are not  current.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any non-Agency prior liens against a housing project are not  paid in full.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any housing project financial accounts are not funded at  required levels, less authorized withdrawals, or any payments due for  operation and maintenance expenses, tax assessments, insurance premiums,  tenant security deposits or other obligations incurred as a part of  housing project operations are not paid in full.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any management deficiencies cited in a compliance violation  notice issued by the Agency to the borrower have not been corrected or  the housing project is not operating under an approved management plan  or, if applicable, an approved management agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any operation and maintenance deficiencies cited in compliance  violation notices issued by the Agency have not been corrected or are  not scheduled for correction in a workout agreement developed in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 3560.453.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The borrower entity is, at the time of the ownership transfer or  sale, cited by the Agency or other Federal, state, or local agencies for  violations of Fair Housing or Equal Opportunity requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The borrower entity is, at the time of the ownership transfer or  sale, cited by the Agency or any other entity involved in the financing  of the housing project for misappropriation of funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Equity payment funding sources. Equity may be provided in cash  or through a loan. If a full equity payment to the transferor is not  paid at the time of the ownership transfer or sale or has not been paid  through an Agency equity loan or third-party equity loan approved by the  Agency to the borrower, the transferee must certify that equity payments  due to the borrower will be paid from sources other than housing  project's funds and must identify the sources of such payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Restrictive-use requirement. Transferees assuming Agency loans,  including loans approved prior to December 21, 1979, will be required to  execute a restrictive-use agreement that contains the language specified  in Sec. 3560.662. The restrictive-use agreement will require the  housing project to be used for program purposes for a specified period  of time beyond the date that the ownership transfer or sale is closed.  When an equity loan is involved at the time of transfer, the  restrictions will be for 30 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subsequent loans. The Agency may approve a subsequent loan or  permit a loan from a third-party source in conjunction with an ownership  transfer or sale of a housing project. The subsequent loan may be in the  form of a junior or parity lien.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsequent loans on a housing project proposed in conjunction  with an ownership transfer or sale must be requested and processed in  accordance with the Agency loan origination requirements in subpart B of  this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency may amortize the subsequent loan over a period not to  exceed the remaining economic life of the housing or 50 years, whichever  is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency may extend the term of the existing loan to a period  not to exceed 30 years or the remaining economic life of the housing,  whichever is less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Loan assumption interest rates. The interest rate for Agency  loans assumed in conjunction with an ownership transfer or sale will be  determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The interest rate for all loans, except farm labor housing  loans, will be set at the lower of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The note rate of the existing Agency loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Agency note rate on the day the transfer is approved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Agency note rate on the day the transfer is closed; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the rents are increased due to a transfer, the transfer will  be done under new rates and terms when the Agency determines that it is  in the best interest of the government. Subsequent loan may be in the  form of a senior, junior or parity lien or soft second.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interest rate on farm labor housing loans will be the rate  specified in the note, except that loans transferred to public bodies,  nonprofit organizations of farm workers, and broadly-based nonprofit  corporations for farm labor housing purposes may be at a one percent  interest rate regardless of the rate specified in the note if the Agency  determines that such a reduction is necessary to maintain affordable  rental rates for tenants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Loan assumption terms. The amount of the loan balance that may  be assumed through an ownership transfer or sale must not exceed the  security value of the housing project determined according to Sec.  3560.406(d)(3)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency may reamortize a loan assumed through an ownership  transfer or sale over a period not to exceed the remaining economic life  of the housing or 50 years, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency may extend the term of the loan to a period not to  exceed 30 years or the remaining economic life of the housing, whichever  is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When loans assumed through an ownership transfer or sale are  amortized on an annual payment basis, the loans will be converted, at  the time of the transfer or sale, to a monthly payment amortization and  will be made subject to PASS. When on- or off-farm labor housing  projects are involved in an ownership transfer or sale, the related  loans may be transferred on a DIAS basis or converted to PASS if the  Agency determines that such a conversion will not be detrimental to the  operation of the farm labor housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Processing ownership transfers or sales. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At the time of the  transfer, the Agency will require the borrower to transfer all  equipment, related facilities, and housing project financial accounts to  the transferee including the operation and maintenance account, reserve  account, tenant security deposit account, tax and insurance escrow  accounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any funds remaining in a rental assistance contract not  dispersed by the transferor will be assigned to the transferee unless  the rental assistance is not needed for tenants or another form of  rental subsidy is to be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any rental assistance determined to be unnecessary will be  reassigned to other housing projects in accordance with the provisions  of subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Agency will require that appropriate loan documents are  executed by the transferee. The Agency may require such documents to be  referenced in security instruments (e.g., mortgage or deed of trust).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If all of a borrower's outstanding Agency debt is not assumed or  paid off at the time of the transfer or sale, the Agency will not  release a borrower from liability unless the Agency determines that the  borrower is unable to pay the remaining debt from assets taken as  security through the debt settlement procedure in accordance with Sec.  3560.457.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Ownership transfers or sales under special rates, terms, and  conditions. Housing projects may be transferred or sold to entities that  do not meet borrower eligibility requirements for the type of loans  being assumed. However, such a transfer or sale will only be considered  when it is determined by the Agency to be in the best interest of the  Federal Government and the objectives of the original loan can no longer  be met. The following special rates, terms, and conditions will apply to  such situations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferee makes a down payment of at least 10 percent of  the remaining loan balance to be assumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transferee has the ability to pay the Agency debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monthly or annual installments will be amortized over the term  of the loan and the interest rate will be at a rate of interest at least  one percent higher than the interest rate offered to eligible borrowers  as specified in paragraphs (i)(1) or (2) of this section.</p>
