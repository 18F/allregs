                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Eligible beneficiaries--Those who have served in the Armed Forces, have been separated under conditions other than dishonorable, and have been determined by the Veterans Administration (VA) to be eligible for care at VA expense. Prior to 7 September 1980, veterans status could be obtained by virtue of 1 day's honorable service. The following restrictions do not apply to individuals who are discharged from active duty because of a disability or who were discharged for reasons of ``early out'' or hardship program under 10 U.S.C. 1171 and 1173.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For individuals with an original enlistment in the military service after 7 September 1980, the law generally denies benefits, including medical care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For individuals entering service after 16 October 1981, the law generally denies medical benefits when such individuals do not complete the shorter of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Twenty-four months of continuous active duty, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The full period for which that person was called or ordered to active duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Inpatient control--Each VAB admitted will be required to conform to regulations governing the internal administration of the naval facility. Restrictive or punitive measures, including disciplinary action or denial of privileges, will conform as nearly as possible to VA instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Resolution of problems--All problems pertaining to VABs, including admission, medical or other records, and all correspondence will be matters of resolution between the commanding officer of the naval facility and the VA

office of jurisdiction authorizing admission. Questions of policy and administration which cannot be so resolved will be forwarded, through the normal chain of command, to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs via COMNAVMEDCOM for resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Care in the United States--(1) Inpatient care. An eligible VAB may be admitted to a naval MTF on presentation of a written authorization for admission signed by an official of the VA office of jurisdiction. Neurological and certain neuropsychiatric patients without obvious evidence of psychosis and not requiring restraints, and instances of suspected tuberculosis, may be admitted for diagnosis. When diagnosed, promptly report instances of psychosis, psychoneurosis, and tuberculosis of present clinical significance to the VA office of jurisdiction with a request for transfer to a VA facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Extent of care. Provide eligible VABs medical and surgical care, including prostheses such as eyes and limbs and appliances such as hearing aids, spectacles, or orthopedic appliances when required for the proper treatment of the condition upon which eligibility is based.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disposition of emergency admission. Notify the appropriate VA office of jurisdiction by message or other expeditious means within 72 hours after the date and hour of an emergency admission of a potential VAB. Include a request for an authorization for admission and emergency treatment. If VA denies VAB status to such a person admitted in an emergency, the provisions of Sec. 728.81(a) are applicable. Once admitted in an emergency situation, discharage a VAB promptly upon termination of the emergency unless arrangements have been made with the VA office of jurisdiction:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For transfer to a VA treatment facility if further treatment is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To retain the patient as a VAB in the naval MTF.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Outpatient care. Outpatient care, including post hospitalization outpatient care, may be provided upon authorization by the VA office of jurisdiction. When outpatient followup care is requested, commanding officers are responsible for determining whether capabilities and workload permit providing such care. In an emergency, provide necessary care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Physical examinations. Upon a determination by a naval MTF commanding officer that space, facilities, and capabilities exist, naval MTFs may provide physical examinations when requested by the VA for the purpose of adjudicating claims for VA physical disability compensation. If authorized by the VA, patients may be admitted when the examination requires more than 1 day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dental care. Limit dental treatment to inpatients who require services adjunctive to medical or surgical conditions for which hospitalized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Care outside the United States--(1) Eligible beneficiaries. Beneficiaries described in paragraph (a) of this section who are citizens of the United States and residing or sojourning abroad may, within the capabilities of the facility as determined by the commanding officer, be provided inpatient and outpatient care upon presentation of an authorization from the appropriate VA office of jurisdiction listed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Emergency care. Overseas naval MTFs furnishing emergency care to potential VABs will promptly notify the appropriate VA office of jurisdiction and request authorization for treatment and instructions for disposition of the patient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Offices of jurisdiction. The following activities are vested with responsibility for issuing authorizations for care and furnishing dispisition instructions for VABs in overseas naval MTFs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the Trust Territory of the Pacific (Micronesia), VA Office, Honolulu, Hawaii.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the Philippines, VA Regional Office, Manila, Philippines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In Canada, Canadian Department of Veterans Affairs, Ottawa, Canada.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In all other foreign countries, consular offices of U.S. embassies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Forms required. (1) Complete a VA 10-10 (Application for Medical Benefits) when potential VABs are admitted for emergency care without prior authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prepare a VA 10-10m (Medical Certificate and History) when care is rendered. All information required in the medical certificate thereon will be furnished whether the admission is subsequently approved or disapproved by the VA office of jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Since the completion of VA 10-10m requires an examination of patients, admissions which are disapproved will be reported as medical examinations on DD 7A, Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients, Outpatient Treatment Furnished (part B) (See subpart J).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Prepare and submit a DD 7 (Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients, Hospitalization Furnished (part A)) on all VABs and potential VABs admitted (see subpart J).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Complete an SF 502 (Narrative Summary) or SF 539 (Abbreviated Clinical Record), as appropriate, when a VAB or potential VAB is discharged or otherwise released. When an interim report of hospitalization is requested by the VA office of jurisdiction, it may be prepared on an SF 502.</p>
