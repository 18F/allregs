Generally, agencies should comply with requests  from other agencies to initiate administrative offset to collect debts  owed to the United States, unless the requesting agency has not complied  with the applicable regulations or the request would otherwise be  contrary to law or the best interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise prohibited by law, a DOL agency may request  that monies due and payable to a debtor by another DOL agency or a  Federal agency outside the Department be administratively offset in  order to collect debts owed the creditor DOL agency by the debtor. In  requesting an administrative offset, the creditor DOL agency must  provide the DOL agency or other Federal agency holding funds of the  debtor with written certification stating</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the debtor owes the creditor agency a debt (including the  amount of debt); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the creditor agency has complied with the applicable  Federal Claims Collection Standards, including any hearing or review.</p>
