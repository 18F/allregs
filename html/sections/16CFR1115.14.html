                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Weekends and holidays are excluded from the computation  of the time periods in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the CPSA simultaneously to the subject  firm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time when obligation to report arises. The obligation to report  under section 15(b) of the CPSA may arise upon receipt by a subject firm  of the first information regarding a noncompliance, or a potential  hazard presented by a product defect, or an unreasonable risk.  Information giving rise to a reporting obligation may include, but is  not limited to, complaints, injury reports, quality control and  engineering data. A subject firm should not await complete or accurate  risk estimates before reporting under section 15(b) of CPSA. However, if  information is not clearly reportable, a subject firm may spend a  reasonable time for investigation and evaluation. (See Sec.  1115.14(d).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Time for investigation and evaluation. A subject firm may  conduct a reasonably expeditious investigation in order to evaluate the  reportability of a death or grievous bodily injury or other information.  This investigation and evaluation should not exceed 10 days unless a  firm can demonstrate that a longer period is reasonable. The Commission  will deem that, at the end of 10 days, a subject firm has received and  considered all information which would have been available to it had a  reasonable, expeditious, and diligent investigation been undertaken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time to report. Immediately, that is, within 24 hours, after a  subject firm has obtained information which reasonably supports the  conclusion that its consumer product fails to comply with an applicable  consumer product safety rule or voluntary consumer product safety  standard, contains a defect which could create a substantial risk of  injury to the public, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury  or death, the firm should report. (See Sec. 1115.13.) If a firm elects  to conduct an investigation in order to evaluate the existence of  reportable information, the 24-hour period begins when the firm has  information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer  product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule  or voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission  has relied under section 9, contains a defect which could create a  substantial product hazard, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious  injury or death. Thus, a firm could report to the Commission before the  conclusion of a reasonably expeditious investigation and evaluation if  the reportable information becomes known during the course of the  investigation. In lieu of the investigation, the firm may report the  information immediately.  [43 FR 34998, Aug. 7, 1978, as amended at 57 FR 34230, Aug. 4, 1992]</p>
