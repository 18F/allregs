                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Effective with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1981, the tax imposed by section 527(b) on the political organization taxable income of a principal campaign committee shall be computed by multiplying the political organization taxable income by the appropriate rates of tax specified in section 11(b). The political organization taxable income of a campaign committee not a principal campaign committee is taxed at the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b). A candidate for Congress may designate one political committee to serve as his or her principal campaign committee for purposes of section 527(h)(1). If a designation is made, it shall be made in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. A candidate for Congress may have only one designation in effect at any time. Under 11 CFR 102.12, no political committee may be designated as the principal campaign committee of more than one candidate for Congress. Further, no political committee that supports or has supported more than one candidate for Congress may be designated as a principal campaign committee. No designation need be made where there is only one political campaign committee with respect to a candidate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manner of designation. If a candidate for Congress elects to make a

designation under section 527(h) and this section, he or she shall designate his or her principal campaign committee by appending a copy of his or her Statement of Candidacy (that is, the Federal Election Commission Form 2, or equivalent statement that the candidate filed with the Federal Election Commission under 11 CFR 101.1(a)), to the Form 1120-POL filed by the principal campaign committee for each taxable year for which the designation is effective. This designation may also be made by appending to the Form 1120-POL statement containing the following information: The name and address of the candidate for Congress; his or her taxpayer identification number; his or her party affiliation and the office sought; the district and State in which the office is sought; and the name and address of the principal campaign comittee. This designation shall be made on or before the due date (as extended) for filing Form 1120-POL. Only a candidate for Congress may make a designation in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manner of revoking designation. A designation of a principal campaign committee that has been filed in accordance with this section may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. In general, the Commissioner will grant such consent in every case where the candidate for Congress has revoked his or her designation in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Election Commission by filing an amended Statement of Organization or its equivalent pursuant to 11 CFR 102.2(a)(2). In the case of the revocation of the designation of a principal campaign committee by a candidate followed by the designation of another principal campaign committee by such candidate, for purposes of determining the appropriate rate of tax under section 11(b) for a taxable year, the political organization taxable income of the first principal campaign committee shall be treated as that of the subsequent principal campaign committee. In a case where consent to revoke a designation of a principal campaign committee is granted and a new designation is filed, the Commissioner may condition his consent upon the agreement of the candidate for Congress to insure compliance with the preceding sentence.
