                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to a person described in Sec.  162.30(a) that issues a debit or credit card (card issuer).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of cardholder. For purposes of this section, a cardholder means a consumer who has been issued a credit or debit card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Address validation requirements. A card issuer must establish and implement reasonable policies and procedures to assess the validity of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of address for a consumer's debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change of address, the card issuer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> Notifies the cardholder of the request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notifies the cardholder of the request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the cardholder's former address; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By any other means of communication that the card issuer and the cardholder have previously agreed to use; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Provides to the cardholder a reasonable means of promptly reporting incorrect address changes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Otherwise assesses the validity of the change of address in accordance with the policies and procedures the card issuer has established pursuant to Sec.  162.30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Alternative timing of address validation. A card issuer may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if it validates an address pursuant to the methods in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section when it receives an address change notification, before it receives a request for an additional or replacement card.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Form of notice. Any written or electronic notice that the card issuer provides under this paragraph must be clear and conspicuous and provided separately from its regular correspondence with the cardholder.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 162--Sample Clauses</p><p class="depth0">A. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model forms in this appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the FCRA for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.</p><p class="depth0">B. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example:</p><p class="depth0">1. Rearranging the order of the references to ``your income'', ``your account history'', and ``your credit score''.</p><p class="depth0">2. Substituting other types of information for ``income'', ``account history'', or ``credit score'' for accuracy, such as ``payment history'', ``credit history'', or ``claims history''.</p><p class="depth0">3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as ``the [ABC] group of companies,'' including without limitation a statement that the entity providing the notice recently purchased the consumer's account.</p><p class="depth0">4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for ``commodity advisor'', ``futures clearing merchant'', or ``swap dealer'' affiliates.</p><p class="depth0">5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, if a person does not limit the duration of the opt-out period, the notice may omit information about the renewal notice.</p><p class="depth0">6. Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make solicitations to them.</p><p class="depth0">7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</p><p class="depth0">8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: ``If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.''</p><p class="depth0">9. Providing a place on the form for the consumer to fill in identifying information, such as his or her name and address.</p><p class="depth0">A-1 Model Form for Initial Opt-out notice (Single-Affiliate Notice)</p><p class="depth0">A-2 Model Form for Initial Opt-out notice (Joint Notice)</p><p class="depth0">A-3 Model Form for Renewal Notice (Single-Affiliate Notice)</p><p class="depth0">A-4 Model Form for Renewal Notice (Joint Notice)</p><p class="depth0">A-5 Model Form for Voluntary ``No Marketing'' Notice</p><p class="depth0">A-1 Model Form for Initial Opt-Out Notice (Single-Affiliate Notice)</p><p class="depth0">[Your Choice To Limit Marketing]/[Marketing Opt Out]

Appendix B to Part 162--Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft</p><p class="depth0">Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation</p><p class="depth0">Section 162.30 requires each financial institution or creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in Sec.  162.30(b)(3), to develop and provide for the continued administration of a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of an Identity Theft Prevention Program that satisfies the requirements of Sec.  162.30.</p><p class="depth0">I. The Identity Theft Prevention Program</p><p class="depth0">In designing its Identity Theft Prevention Program, a financial institution or creditor may incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.</p><p class="depth0">II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Risk factors. A financial institution or creditor should consider the following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for covered accounts, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Its previous experiences with identity theft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sources of Red Flags. Financial institutions and creditors should incorporate relevant Red Flags from sources such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Incidents of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has experienced;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Methods of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicable supervisory guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Categories of Red Flags. The Identity Theft Prevention Program should include relevant Red Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this Appendix B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The presentation of suspicious documents;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address change;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial institution or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">III. Detecting Red Flags</p><p class="depth0">The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should address the detection of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity of, a person opening a covered account; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Authenticating customers, monitoring transactions, and verifying the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing covered accounts.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft</p><p class="depth0">The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution or creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Internet Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contacting the customer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reopening a covered account with a new account number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Not opening a new covered account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Closing an existing covered account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Notifying law enforcement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">V. Updating the Identity Theft Prevention Program</p><p class="depth0">Financial institutions and creditors should update the Identity Theft Prevention Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on factors such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The experiences of the financial institution or creditor with identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Changes in methods of identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Changes in the types of accounts that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Changes in the business arrangements of the financial institution or creditor, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.</p><p class="depth0">VI. Methods for Administering the Identity Theft Prevention Program</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Oversight of Identity Theft Prevention Program. Oversight by the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Assigning specific responsibility for the Identity Theft Prevention Program's implementation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the financial institution or creditor with Sec.  162.30; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Approving material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program as necessary to address changing identity theft risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reports. (1) In general. Staff of the financial institution or creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its Identity Theft Prevention Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee, at least annually, on compliance by the financial institution or creditor with Sec.  162.30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of report. The report should address material matters related to the Identity Theft Prevention Program and evaluate issues such as: The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Oversight of service provider arrangements. Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.</p><p class="depth0">VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Financial institutions and creditors should be mindful of other related legal requirements that may be applicable, such as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For financial institutions and creditors that are subject to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), filing a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable law and regulation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h) regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the financial institution or creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from identity theft.</p><p class="depth0">Supplement A to Appendix B</p><p class="depth0">In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended in section II(b) of the Guidelines in Appendix B of this part, each financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its Identity Theft Prevention Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:</p><p class="depth0">Alerts, Notifications or Warnings From a Consumer Reporting Agency</p><p class="depth0">1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.</p><p class="depth0">2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.</p><p class="depth0">3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in Sec. 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).</p><p class="depth0">4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:</p><p class="depth0">a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;</p><p class="depth0">b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;</p><p class="depth0">c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or</p><p class="depth0">d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">Suspicious Documents</p><p class="depth0">5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.</p><p class="depth0">6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.</p><p class="depth0">7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification.</p><p class="depth0">8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check.</p><p class="depth0">9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.</p><p class="depth0">Suspicious Personal Identifying Information</p><p class="depth0">10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.</p><p class="depth0">11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.</p><p class="depth0">12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.</p><p class="depth0">13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or</p><p class="depth0">b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.</p><p class="depth0">14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.</p><p class="depth0">15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.</p><p class="depth0">16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.</p><p class="depth0">17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.</p><p class="depth0">18. For financial institutions or creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.</p><p class="depth0">Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account</p><p class="depth0">19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement means of accessing the account or for the addition of an authorized user on the account.</p><p class="depth0">20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:</p><p class="depth0">a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics equipment or jewelry); or</p><p class="depth0">b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.</p><p class="depth0">21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:</p><p class="depth0">a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;</p><p class="depth0">b. A material increase in the use of available credit;</p><p class="depth0">c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;</p><p class="depth0">d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in connection with a deposit account; or</p><p class="depth0">e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a cellular phone account.</p><p class="depth0">22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of

account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).</p><p class="depth0">23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.</p><p class="depth0">24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.</p><p class="depth0">25. The financial institution or creditor is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.</p><p class="depth0">Notice From Customers, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in</p><p class="depth0">Connection With Covered Accounts Held by the Financial Institution or</p><p class="depth0">Creditor</p><p class="depth0">26. The financial institution or creditor is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
