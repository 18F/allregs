For purposes of this subpart, the hazardous waste incinerator includes all associated firing systems and air pollution control devices, as well as the combustion chamber equipment.</p><p class="depth2">Hazardous waste lightweight aggregate kiln means a rotary kiln that produces clinker by heating materials such as slate, shale and clay for subsequent production of lightweight aggregate used in commerce, and that burns hazardous waste at any time.</p><p class="depth2">Hazardous waste liquid fuel boiler means a boiler defined under Sec.  260.10 of this chapter that does not burn solid fuels and that burns hazardous waste at any time. Liquid fuel boiler includes boilers that only burn gaseous fuel.</p><p class="depth2">Hazardous waste residence time means the time elapsed from cutoff of the flow of hazardous waste into the combustor (including, for example, the time required for liquids to flow from the cutoff valve into the combustor) until solid, liquid, and gaseous materials from the hazardous waste (excluding residues that may adhere to combustion chamber surfaces and excluding waste-derived recycled materials such as cement kiln dust and internally recycled metals) exit the combustion chamber. For combustors with multiple firing systems whereby the residence time may vary for the firing systems, the hazardous waste residence time for purposes of complying with this subpart means the longest residence time for any firing system in use at the time of the waste cutoff.</p><p class="depth2">Hazardous waste solid fuel boiler means a boiler defined under Sec.  260.10 of this chapter that burns a solid fuel and that burns hazardous waste at any time.</p><p class="depth2">Initial comprehensive performance test means the comprehensive performance test that is used as the basis for initially demonstrating compliance with the standards.</p><p class="depth2">In-line kiln raw mill means a hazardous waste burning cement kiln design whereby kiln gas is ducted through the raw material mill for portions of time to facilitate drying and heating of the raw material.</p><p class="depth2">Instantaneous monitoring for combustion system leak control means detecting and recording pressure, without use of an averaging period, at a frequency adequate to detect combustion system leak events from hazardous waste combustion.</p><p class="depth2">Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission control device (e.g. positive pressure fabric filter) that extends the length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its length (i.e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.</p><p class="depth2">MTEC means maximum theoretical emissions concentration of metals or HCl/Cl, expressed as [micro]g/dscm, and is calculated by dividing the feedrate by the gas flowrate.</p><p class="depth2">New source means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after the dates specified under Sec.
