                            <p class="depth0">Public disclosure, regardless of source or form, of information  currently classified or being considered for classification does not  preclude initial or continued classification. However, such disclosure  requires an immediate reevaluation to determine whether the information  has been compromised to the extent that downgrading or declassification  is indicated. Similar consideration must be given to related items of  information in all programs, projects, or items incorporating or  pertaining to the compromised items of information. In these cases, if a  release were made or authorized by an official Government source,  classification of clearly identified items may no longer be warranted.  Questions as to the propriety of continued classification should be  referred to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program  Committee.</p>
