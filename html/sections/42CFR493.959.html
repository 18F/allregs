                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Types of services offered by laboratories. In immunohematology, there are four types of laboratories for proficiency testing purposes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those that perform ABO group and/or D (Rho) typing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Those that perform ABO group and/or D (Rho) typing, and unexpected antibody detection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Those that in addition to paragraph (a)(2) of this section perform compatibility testing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Those that perform in addition to paragraph (a)(3) of this section antibody identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program content and frequency of challenge. To be approved for proficiency testing for immunohematology, a program must provide a minimum of five samples per testing event. There must be at least three testing events at approximately equal intervals per year. The annual program must provide samples that cover the full range of interpretation that would be expected in patient specimens. The samples may be provided through mailed shipments or, at HHS' option, may be provided to HHS or its designee for on-site testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Challenges per testing event. The minimum number of challenges per testing event a program must provide for each analyte or test procedure is five.</p><p class="depth2">Analyte or Test Procedure

HHS approves only those programs that assess the accuracy of a laboratory's response in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response, a program must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the response that reflects agreement of either 100 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 95 percent or more of all participating laboratories except for unexpected antibody detection and antibody identification. To determine the accuracy of a laboratory's response for unexpected antibody detection and antibody identification, a program must compare the laboratory's response for each analyte with the response that reflects agreement of either 95 percent of ten or more referee laboratories or 95 percent or more of all participating laboratories. The score for a sample in immunohematology is either the score determined under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Criteria for acceptable performance.
