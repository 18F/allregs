                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any provision of a collective bargaining agreement that is inconsistent with this part and/or its implementing directives is unenforceable on the effective date of coverage under the applicable subpart or directive. In accordance with procedures and time limits established by the HSLRB under Sec. 9701.509, an exclusive representative may appeal to the HSLRB the Department's determination that a provision is unenforceable. Provisions that are identified by the Department as unenforceable remain unenforceable unless held otherwise by the HSLRB on appeal. The Secretary or designee, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may continue all or part of a particular provision(s) with respect to a specific category or categories of employees

and may cancel such continued provisions at any time; such determinations are not precedential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon request by an exclusive representative, the parties will have 60 days after the effective date of coverage under the applicable subpart and/or implementing directive to bring into conformance those remaining negotiable terms directly affected by the terms rendered unenforceable by the applicable subpart and/or implementing directive. If the parties fail to reach agreement by that date, they may utilize the negotiation impasse provisions of Sec. 9701.519 to resolve the matter. Agreements reached under this section are subject to approval under Sec. 9701.515(d). Nothing in this paragraph will delay the effective date of an implementing directive.</p>
