                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A corporation which is a DISC for a taxable year is not subject to any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Code (sections 1 through 1564) for such taxable year, except for the tax imposed by chapter 5 thereof (sections 1491 through 1494) on certain transfers to avoid tax. Thus, for example, a corporation which is a DISC for a taxable year is not subject for such year to the corporate income tax (section 11), the minimum tax on tax preferences (sections 56 through 58), or the accumulated earnings tax (sections 531 through 537). A DISC is liable for the payment of all taxes payable by corporations under other subtitles of the Code, such as, for example, income taxes withheld at the source and other employment taxes under subtitle C and the interest equalization tax and other miscellaneous excise taxes imposed by subtitle D. In addition, a DISC is subject to the provisions of chapter 3 of subtitle A (including section 1461), relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations and tax-free covenant bonds. See Sec. 1.992-1 for the definition of the term ``DISC.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of taxable income--(1) In general. Although a DISC is not subject to tax under subtitle A of the Code (other than chapter 5 thereof), a DISC's taxable income shall be determined for each taxable year in order to determine, for example, the amount deemed distributed for that taxable year to its shareholders pursuant to Sec. 1.995-2. Except as otherwise provided in the Code and the regulations thereunder, the taxable income of a DISC shall be determined in the same manner as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Thus, for example, a DISC chooses its method of depreciation, inventory method, and annual accounting period in the same manner as if it were a corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Any elections affecting the determination of taxable income shall be made by the DISC. Thus, as a further example, a DISC which makes an installment sale described in section 453 is able to avail itself of the benefits of section 453: Provided, The DISC complies with the election requirements of such section. See Sec. 1.995-2(e) and Sec. 1.996-8 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the application for a taxable year of a DISC of a deduction under section 172 for a net operating loss carryback or carryover or of a capital loss carryback or carryover under section 1212.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Although a DISC is not subject to tax under subtitle A of the Code (other than chapter 5 thereof), a DISC's taxable income shall be determined for each taxable year in order to determine, for example, the amount deemed distributed for that taxable year to its shareholders pursuant to Sec. 1.995-2. Except as otherwise provided in the Code and the regulations thereunder, the taxable income of a DISC shall be determined in the same manner as if the DISC were a domestic corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Thus, for example, a DISC chooses its method of depreciation, inventory method, and annual accounting period in the same manner as if it were a corporation which had not elected to be treated as a DISC. Any elections affecting the determination of taxable income shall be made by the DISC. Thus, as a further example, a DISC which makes an installment sale described in section 453 is able to avail itself of the benefits of section 453: Provided, The DISC complies with the election requirements of such section. See Sec. 1.995-2(e) and Sec. 1.996-8 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the application for a taxable year of a DISC of a deduction under section 172 for a net operating loss carryback or carryover or of a capital loss carryback or carryover under section 1212.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Choice of method of accounting. A DISC may, generally, choose any method of accounting permissible under section 446(c) and the regulations thereunder. However, if a DISC is a member of a controlled group (as defined in Sec. 1.993-1(k)), the DISC may not choose a method of accounting which, when applied to transactions between the DISC and other members of the controlled group, will result in a material distortion of the income of the DISC or any other member of the controlled group. Such a material distortion of income would occur, for example, if a DISC chooses to use the cash method of accounting where the DISC acts as commission agent in a substantial volume of sales of property by a related corporation which uses the accrual method of accounting and which customarily pays commissions to the DISC more than 2 months after such sales. As a further example, a material distortion of income would occur if a DISC chooses to use the accrual method of accounting where the DISC leases a substantial amount of property from a related corporation which uses the cash method of accounting, if the DISC customarily accrues any portion of the rent on such property more than 2 months before the rent is paid. Changes in the method of accounting of a DISC are subject to the requirements of section 446(e) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Choice of annual accounting period--(i) In general. A DISC may choose its annual accounting period without regard to the annual accounting period of any of its stockholders. In general,

changes in the annual accounting period of a DISC are subject to the requirements of section 442 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A DISC may choose its annual accounting period without regard to the annual accounting period of any of its stockholders. In general,

changes in the annual accounting period of a DISC are subject to the requirements of section 442 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transition rule for change in taxable year in order to become a DISC. A corporation may, without the consent of the Commissioner, change its annual accounting period and adopt a new taxable year beginning on the first day of any month in 1972: Provided, That--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Such change has the effect of accelerating the time as of which such corporation can become a DISC,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Commissioner is notified of such change by means of a statement filed (with the regional service center with which such corporation files its election to be treated as a DISC) not later than the end of the period during which such corporation may file an election to be treated as a DISC for such new taxable year, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The short period required to effect such change is not a taxable year in which such corporation has a net operating loss as defined in section 172.
Thus, for example, if a corporation which uses the calendar year for its taxable year does not complete arrangements to become a DISC until May 15, 1972, such corporation can, pursuant to this subdivision, change its annual accounting period and adopt a taxable year beginning on the first day of any month in 1972 after May. A change to a new annual accounting period made pursuant to this subdivision is effective only if the corporation which makes such change qualifies as a DISC for such new period. A corporation may change its annual accounting period and adopt a new taxable year pursuant to this subdivision without regard to the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-76 (relating to the taxable year of members of a group). A copy of the statement described in (b) of this subdivision shall be attached to the return of a corporation for the new taxable year to which such corporation changes pursuant to this subdivision. A corporation which changes its annual accounting period pursuant to this subparagraph will not be permitted under section 442 to change its annual accounting period at any time before 1982, except with the consent of the Commissioner as provided in Sec. 1.442-1(b)(1) or pursuant to subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transition rule for change of taxable year of certain DISC's. In the case of a DISC all of the shares of which are held by a single shareholder or by members of a group who file a consolidated return, such DISC may (without the consent of the Commissioner) change its annual accounting period and adopt a taxable year beginning in 1972 which is the same as the taxable year of such shareholder or the members of such group. A change to a new annual accounting period may be made by a DISC pursuant to this subparagraph even if such DISC has changed its annual accounting period pursuant to subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transition rule for beginning of first taxable year of certain corporations. If a corporation organized before January 1, 1972, neither acquires assets (other than cash or other property acquired as consideration for the issuance of stock) nor begins doing business prior to January 1, 1972, the first taxable year of such corporation is deemed to begin at the time such corporation acquires any asset (other than cash or other property acquired as consideration for the issuance of stock) or begins doing business, whichever is earlier: Provided, That such corporation is a DISC for such first taxable year. For purposes of Sec. 1.6012-2(a), such corporation is treated as not coming into existence until the beginning of such first taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. The provisions of this section and the regulations under sections 992 through 997 apply with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1971, except that a corporation may not be a DISC for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1972.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Related statutes. For rules relating to the transfer, during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976, to a DISC of assets of an export trade corporation (as defined in section 971), where a parent owns all the outstanding stock of both such DISC and such export trade corporation, see section 505(b) of the Revenue Act of 1971 (85 Stat. 551). For rules regarding limitations on the qualification of a corporation as an export trade corporation

for any taxable year beginning after October 31, 1971, see section 971(a)(3).
