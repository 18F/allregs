                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If in any exchange to which the provisions of section 354 or section 355 would apply except for the fact that there is received by the shareholders or security holders other property (in addition to property permitted to be received without recognition of gain by such sections) or money, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The gain, if any, to the taxpayer shall be recognized in an amount not in excess of the sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property, but,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The loss, if any, to the taxpayer from the exchange or distribution shall not be recognized to any extent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of computing the gain, if any, recognized pursuant to section 356 and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, to the extent the terms of the exchange specify the other property or money that is received in exchange for a particular share of stock or security surrendered or a particular class of stock or securities surrendered, such

terms shall control provided that such terms are economically reasonable. To the extent the terms of the exchange do not specify the other property or money that is received in exchange for a particular share of stock or security surrendered or a particular class of stock or securities surrendered, a pro rata portion of the other property and money received shall be treated as received in exchange for each share of stock and security surrendered, based on the fair market value of such surrendered share of stock or security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the distribution of such other property or money by or on behalf of a corporation has the effect of the distribution of a dividend, then there shall be chargeable to each distributee (either an individual or a corporation)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As a dividend, such an amount of the gain recognized as is not in excess of the distributee's ratable share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As a gain from the exchange of property, the remainder of the gain so recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The rules of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In an exchange to which the provisions of section 356 apply and to which section 354 would apply but for the receipt of property not permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, A (either an individual or a corporation), received the following in exchange for a share of stock having an adjusted basis to A of $85:
One share of stock worth...................................         $100Cash.......................................................           25Other property (basis $25) fair market value...............           50</p><p class="depth0">Total fair market value of consideration received......          175</p><p class="depth0">Adjusted basis of stock surrendered in exchange........           85</p><p class="depth0">Total gain.........................................           90</p><p class="depth0">Gain to be recognized, limited to cash and other property             75</p><p class="depth0">received..................................................A's pro rata share of earnings and profits accumulated                30</p><p class="depth0">after February 28, 1913 (taxable dividend)................</p><p class="depth0">Remainder to be treated as a gain from the exchange of            45</p><p class="depth0">property..............................................------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. If, in Example 1, A's stock had an adjusted basis to A of $200, A would have realized a loss of $25 on the exchange, which loss would not be recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. J, an individual, acquired 10 shares of Class A stock of Corporation X on Date 1 for $3 each and 10 shares of Class B stock of Corporation X on Date 2 for $9 each. On Date 3, Corporation Y acquires the assets of Corporation X in a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A). Pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization, J surrenders all of J's shares of Corporation X stock for 10 shares of Corporation Y stock and $100 of cash. On the date of the exchange, the fair market value of each share of Class A stock of Corporation X is $10, the fair market value of each share of Class B stock of Corporation X is $10, and the fair market value of each share of Corporation Y stock is $10. The terms of the exchange do not specify that shares of Corporation Y stock or cash are received in exchange for particular shares of Class A stock or Class B stock of Corporation X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (b) of this section, because the terms of the exchange do not specify that the cash is received in exchange for shares of Class A or Class B stock of Corporation X, a pro rata portion of the cash received is treated as received in exchange for each share of Class A stock of Corporation X and each share of Class B stock of Corporation X based on the fair market value of the surrendered shares. Therefore, J is treated as receiving shares of Corporation Y stock with a fair market value of $50 and $50 of cash in exchange for its shares of Class A stock of Corporation X and shares of Corporation Y stock with a fair market value of $50 and $50 of cash in exchange for its shares of Class B stock of Corporation X. J realizes a gain of $70 on the exchange of shares of Class A stock, $50 of which is recognized under section 356 and paragraph (a) of this section, and J realizes a gain of $10 on the exchange of shares of Class B stock of Corporation X, all of which is recognized under section 356 and paragraph (a) of this section. Assuming that J's gain recognized is not treated as a dividend under section 356(a)(2), such gain shall be treated as gain from the exchange of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the terms of the plan of reorganization specify that J receives

10 shares of stock of Corporation Y in exchange for J's shares of Class A stock of Corporation X and $100 of cash in exchange for J's shares of Class B stock of Corporation X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Under paragraph (b) of this section, because the terms of the exchange specify that J receives 10 shares of stock of Corporation Y in exchange for J's shares of Class A stock of Corporation X and $100 of cash in exchange for J's shares of Class B stock of Corporation X and such terms are economically reasonable, such terms control. J realizes a gain of $70 on the exchange of shares of Class A stock, none of which is recognized under section 356 and paragraph (a) of this section, and J realizes a gain of $10 on the exchange of shares of Class B stock of Corporation X, all of which is recognized under section 356 and paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Section 301(b)(1)(B) and section 301(d)(2) do not apply to a distribution of ``other property'' to a corporate shareholder if such distribution is within the provisions of section 356.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> See paragraph (l) of Sec. 1.301-1 for certain transactions which are not within the scope of section 356.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> This section applies to exchanges and distributions of stock and securities occurring on or after January 23, 2006.
