Whenever the committee finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in special outlets, and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and further certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart_Assessment Rates</p>
