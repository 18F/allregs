                            <p class="depth0">The port director may authorize an operator to break a Customs in- bond seal affixed under Sec. 18.4 of this chapter, or under any Customs  order or directive, on any vehicle or intermodal container containing  merchandise approved for admission to the zone upon its arrival at the  zone; or to affix a Customs in-bond seal to any vehicle or intermodal  container of merchandise for which an entry, withdrawal, or other  approval document has been obtained for movement in-bond from the zone.  The authorized affixing or breaking of that seal will be considered to  have been done under Customs supervision. The operator shall report to  the port director, upon arrival of the vehicle or container at the zone,  any seal found to be broken, missing, or improperly affixed, and hold  the vehicle or container and its contents intact pending instructions  from the port director. If the operator does not obtain the written  concurrence of the carrier as to the condition of the seal or delivering  conveyance, the port director shall deem the seal or delivering  conveyance to be intact.
