                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Change in jurisdiction over and disposal of lands. The final  disposal by the United States of any tract of land traversed by a right- of-way shall not be construed to be a revocation of the right-of-way in  whole or in part, but such final disposition shall be deemed and taken  to be subject to such right-of-way unless it has been specifically  canceled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfer of easement or permit. Any proposed transfer, by  assignment, lease, operating agreement or otherwise, of an easement or  permit must be   filed in triplicate with the Regional Director and must be supported by  a stipulation that the transferee agrees to comply with and be bound by  the terms and conditions of the original grant. A $25 nonreturnable  service fee must accompany the proposal. No transfer will be recognized  unless and until approved in writing by the Regional Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposal of property on termination of right-of-way. In the  absence of any agreement to the contrary, the holder of the right-of-way  will be allowed 6 months after termination to remove all property or  improvements other than a road and useable improvements to a road,  placed thereon by him; otherwise, all such property and improvements  shall become the property of the United States. Extensions of time may  be granted at the discretion of the Regional Director.  [31 FR 16026, Dec. 15, 1966, as amended at 42 FR 43919, Aug. 31, 1977]</p>
