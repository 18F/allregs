                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applicability and effective date--(1) Purpose and scope. These regulations provide guidance with respect to defining the functional currency of a taxpayer and each qualified business unit (QBU), as defined in section 989(a). Generally, a taxpayer and each QBU must make all determinations under subtitle A of the Code (relating to income taxes) in its respective functional currency. This section sets forth rules for determining when the functional currency is the United States dollar (dollar) or a currency other than the dollar. Section 1.985-2 provides an election to use the dollar as the functional currency for certain QBUs that absent the election would have a functional currency that is a hyperinflationary currency, and explains the effect of making the election. Section 1.985-3 sets forth the dollar approximate separate transactions method that certain QBUs must use to compute their income or loss or earnings and profits. Section 1.985-4 provides that the adoption of a functional currency is a method of accounting and sets forth conditions for a change in functional currency. Section 1.985-5 provides adjustments that are required to be made upon a change in functional currency. Finally, Sec. 1.985-6 provides transition rules for a QBU that uses the dollar approximate separate transactions method for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and scope.

These regulations apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. However, any taxpayer desiring to apply temporary Income Tax Regulations Sec. 1.985-0T through Sec. 1.985-4T in lieu of these regulations to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and on or before October 20, 1989 may (on a consistent basis) so choose.

The dollar shall be the functional currency of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A taxpayer that is not a QBU (e.g., an individual);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A QBU that conducts its activities primarily in dollars. A QBU conducts its activities primarily in dollars if the currency of the economic environment in which the QBU conducts its activities is primarily the dollar. The facts and circumstances test set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall apply in making this determination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as otherwise provided by ruling or administrative pronouncement, a QBU that has the United States, or any possession or territory of the United States where the dollar is the standard currency, as its residence (as defined in section 988(a)(3)(B));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A QBU that does not keep books and records in the currency of any economic environment in which a significant part of its activities is conducted.

For taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, any QBU that otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency must use the dollar as its functional currency and compute income or loss or earnings and profits under the rules of Sec. 1.985-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, any QBU that otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency must use the dollar as its functional currency and compute income or loss or earnings and profits under the rules of Sec. 1.985-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exceptions--(1)--Certain QBU branches. The functional currency of a QBU that otherwise would be required to use a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency and that is a branch of a foreign corporation having a non-dollar functional currency that is not hyperinflationary shall be the functional currency of the foreign corporation. Such QBU's income or loss or earnings and profits shall be determined under Sec. 1.985-3 by substituting the functional currency of the foreign corporation for the dollar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation. A foreign corporation (or its QBU branch) operating in a hyperinflationary environment is not required to use the dollar as its functional currency pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if that foreign corporation is not a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 957 or 953(c)(1)(B). However, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation, as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E), may elect to use the dollar (or, if appropriate, the currency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(1) of this section) as its (or its QBU branch's) functional currency under the procedures set forth in Sec. 1.985-2(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Change in functional currency. (1) In general. If a QBU is required to change its functional currency to the dollar under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, or chooses or is required to change its functional currency to the dollar for any open taxable year (and all subsequent taxable years) under Sec. 1.985-3(a)(2)(ii), the change is considered to be made with the consent of the Commissioner for purposes of Sec. 1.985-4. A QBU changing functional currency must make adjustments described in Sec. 1.985-7 if the year of change (as defined in Sec. 1.481-1(a)(1)) begins after 1987, or the adjustments described in Sec. 1.985-6 if the year of change begins in 1987. No adjustments under section 481 are required solely because of a change in functional currency described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) applies to taxable years beginning after April 6, 1998. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) to all open years after December 31, 1986, provided each person, and each QBU branch of a person, that is related (within the meaning of Sec. 1.985-2(d)(3)) also applies to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hyperinflationary currency. For purposes of sections 985 through 989, the term hyperinflationary currency means the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 100 percent as determined by reference to the consumer price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of the ``International Financial Statistics'' or a successor publication of the International Monetary Fund. If a country's currency is not listed in the monthly issues of ``International Financial Statistics,'' a QBU may use any other reasonable method consistently applied for determining the country's consumer price index. Base period means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the current calendar year. For this purpose, the cumulative inflation rate for the base period is based on compounded inflation rates. Thus, if for 1991, 1992, and 1993, a country's annual inflation rates are 29 percent, 25 percent, and 30 percent, respectively, the cumulative inflation rate for the three-year base period is 110 percent [((1.29 x 1.25 x 1.3)-1.0 x 1.10)x100=110%] and the currency of the country for the QBU's 1994 year is considered hyperinflationary. In making the determination whether a currency is hyperinflationary, the determination for purposes of United States generally accepted accounting principles may be used for income tax purposes provided the determination is based on criteria that is substantially similar to the rules previously set forth in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D), the

method of determination is applied consistently from year to year, and the same method is applied to all related persons as defined in Sec. 1.985-3(e)(2)(vi).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Change in functional currency when currency ceases to be hyperinflationary--(1) In general. A QBU that has been required to use the dollar as its functional currency under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or has elected to use the dollar as its functional currency under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B)(2) of this section or Sec. 1.985-2, must change its functional currency as of the first day of the first taxable year that follows three consecutive taxable years in which the currency of its economic environment, determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is not a hyperinflationary currency. The functional currency of the QBU for such year shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of Sec. 1.985-4, the change is considered to be made with the consent of the Commissioner. See Sec. 1.985-5 for adjustments that are required upon a change in functional currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective Date. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after April 6, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Functional currency of a QBU that is not required to use the dollar--(1) General rule. The functional currency of a QBU that is not required to use the dollar under paragraph (b) of this section shall be the currency of the economic environment in which a significant part of the QBU's activities is conducted, if the QBU keeps, or is presumed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to keep, its books and records in such currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. The functional currency of a QBU that is not required to use the dollar under paragraph (b) of this section shall be the currency of the economic environment in which a significant part of the QBU's activities is conducted, if the QBU keeps, or is presumed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to keep, its books and records in such currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Economic environment. For purposes of section 985 and the regulations thereunder, the economic environment in which a significant part of a QBU's activities is conducted shall be determined by taking into account all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts and circumstances. The facts and circumstances that are considered in determining the economic environment in which a significant part of a QBU's activities is conducted include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The currency of the country in which the QBU is a resident as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The currencies of the QBU's cash flows;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The currencies in which the QBU generates revenues and incurs expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The currencies in which the QBU borrows and lends;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The currencies of the QBU's sales markets;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The currencies in which pricing and other financial decisions are made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The duration of the QBU's business operations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The significance and/or volume of the QBU's independent activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rate of inflation. The rate of inflation (regardless of how it is determined) shall not be a factor used to determine a QBU's economic environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Consistency. A taxpayer must consistently apply the facts and circumstances test set forth in this paragraph (c)(2) in evaluating the economic environment of its QBUs, e.g., its branches, that engage in the same or similar trades or businesses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Books and records presumption. A QBU shall be presumed to keep books and records in the currency of the economic environment in which a significant part of its activities are conducted. The presumption may be overcome only if the QBU can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director that a substantial nontax purpose exists for not keeping any books and records in such currency. A taxpayer may not use this presumption affirmatively in determining a QBU's functional currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Multiple currencies. If a QBU has more than one currency that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the QBU may choose any such currency as its functional currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Relationship of United States accounting principles. In making the functional currency determination under this paragraph (c), the currency of the QBU for purposes of United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) will ordinarily be accepted as the functional currency of the QBU for income tax purposes, provided that the

GAAP determination is based on facts and circumstances substantially similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effect of changed circumstances. Regardless of any change in circumstances, a QBU may change its functional currency determined under this paragraph (c) only if the QBU complies with Sec. 1.985-4 or the Commissioner's consent is considered to have been granted under Sec. 1.985-2(d)(4) or Sec. 1.985-3(a)(2)(ii). For special rules relating to the conversion to the euro, see Sec. 1.985-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Single functional currency for a foreign corporation--(1) General rule. This paragraph (d) applies to a foreign corporation that has two or more QBUs that do not have the same functional currency. The foreign corporation shall be treated as having a single functional currency for the corporation as a whole that is different from the functional currency of one or more of its QBUs. The determination of a foreign corporation's functional currency shall be made by first applying paragraph (d)(1)(i) and then paragraph (d)(l)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. This paragraph (d) applies to a foreign corporation that has two or more QBUs that do not have the same functional currency. The foreign corporation shall be treated as having a single functional currency for the corporation as a whole that is different from the functional currency of one or more of its QBUs. The determination of a foreign corporation's functional currency shall be made by first applying paragraph (d)(1)(i) and then paragraph (d)(l)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Step 1. Each QBU of the foreign corporation determines its functional currency in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and Sec. 1.985-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. The foreign corporation determines its functional currency applying the principles of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to the corporation's activities as a whole. Thus, if a foreign corporation has two branches, the corporation shall determine its functional currency by applying the principles of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to the combined activities of the corporation and the branches. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), if a QBU of a foreign corporation has the dollar as its functional currency under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the QBU's activities shall be considered dollar activities of the corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Translation of income or loss of QBUs having different functional currencies than the foreign corporation as a whole. Where the functional currency of a foreign corporation as a whole differs from the functional currency of one or more of its QBUs, each such QBU shall determine the amount of its income or loss or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) in its functional currency under the principles of section 987 (relating to branch transactions). The amount of income or loss or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) of each QBU in its functional currency shall then be translated into the foreign corporation's functional currency using the appropriate exchange rate as defined in section 989(b)(4) for purposes of determining the corporation's income or loss or earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Translation of nonfunctional currency transactions. Except for a QBU using the dollar approximate separate transactions method described in Sec. 1.985-3, see section 988 and the regulations thereunder for the treatment of nonfunctional currency transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, operates exclusively through foreign branch X in Country A. X is a QBU within the meaning of section 989(a) and its residence is Country A as determined under section 988 (a)(3)(B). The currency of Country A is the LC. All of X's purchases, sales, and expenses are in the LC. The laws of A require X to keep books and records in the LC. It is determined that the LC is the currency of X under United States generally accepted accounting principles. This determination is based on facts and circumstances substantially similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Under these facts, while the functional currency of P is the dollar since its residence is the United States, the functional currency of X is the LC.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. P, a publicly-held domestic regulated investment company (as defined under section 851), operates exclusively through foreign branch B in Country R. B is a QBU within the meaning of section 989(a) and its residence is Country R as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B). The currency of Country R is the LC. B's principal activities consist of purchasing and selling stock and securities of Country R companies and securities issued by Country R. It is determined that the dollar is the currency of B under United States generally accepted accounting principles. This determination is not based on facts and circumstances substantially similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Under these facts, while the functional currency of P is the dollar since its residence is the United States, B may

choose the LC as its functional currency because it has significant activities in the LC provided it keeps books and records in the LC. The fact that the dollar is the currency of B under generally accepted accounting principles is irrelevant for purposes of determining B's functional currency because the GAAP determination was not based on factors similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. P, a domestic bank, operates through foreign branch X in Country R. X is a QBU within the meaning of section 989(a) and its residence is Country R as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B). The currency of Country R is the LC. The laws of R require X to keep books and records in the LC. The branch customarily loans dollars and LCs. In the case of its LC loans, X ordinarily fixes the terms of the loans by reference to a contemporary London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) on dollar deposits. For instance, the interest on the amount of the outstanding LC loan principal might equal LIBOR plus 2 percent and the amount of the outstanding LC loan principal would be adjusted to reflect changes in the dollar value of the LC. X is primarily funded with dollar-denominated funds borrowed from related and unrelated parties. X's only LC activities are paying local taxes, employee wages, and local expenses such as rent and electricity. Under these facts, X's activities are primarily conducted in dollars. Thus, although X keeps its books and records in LCs, X's functional currency is the dollar.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. S, a foreign corporation organized in Country U, is wholly-owned by P, a domestic corporation. The currency of Country U is the LC. S's sole function is acting as a financing vehicle for P and domestic corporations that are affiliated with P. All borrowing and lending transactions between S and P and its domestic affiliates are in dollars. Furthermore, primarily all of S's other borrowings are dollar-denominated or based on a dollar index. S's only LC activities are paying local taxes, employee wages, and local expenses such as rent and electricity. S keeps its books and records in the LC. Under these facts, S's activities are primarily conducted in dollars. Thus, although S keeps its books and records in LCs, S's functional currency is the dollar.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. D is a domestic corporation whose primary activity is the extraction of natural gas and oil through foreign branch X in Country Y. X is a QBU within the meaning of section 989(a) and its residence is Country Y as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B). The currency of Country Y is the LC. X bills a significant amount of its natural gas and oil sales in dollars and a significant amount in LCs. X also incurs significant LC and dollar expenses and liabilities. The laws of Country Y require X to keep its books and records in the LC. It is determined that the LC is the currency of X under United States generally accepted accounting principles. This determination is based on facts and circumstances substantially similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Absent other factors indicating that X primarily conducts its activities in the dollar, D could choose either the dollar or the LC as X's functional currency because X has significant activities in both the dollar and the LC, provided the books and records requirement is satisfied. If, instead, X's activities were determined to be primarily in the dollar, then X would have to use the dollar as its functional currency.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. S, a foreign corporation organized in Country U, is wholly-owned by P, a domestic corporation. The currency of U is the LC. S purchases the products it sells from related and unrelated parties, including P. These purchases are made in the LC. In addition, most of S's gross receipts are generated by transactions denominated in the LC. S attempts to determine its LC price for goods sold in such a manner as to obtain an LC equivalent of a certain dollar amount after reduction for all LC costs. However, local market conditions sometimes result in pricing adjustments. Thus, changes in the LC-dollar exchange rate from period to period generally result in corresponding changes in the LC price of S's products. S pays local taxes, employee wages, and other local expenses in the LC. It is determined that the dollar is the currency of S under United States generally accepted accounting principles. This determination is not based on facts and circumstances substantially similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Under these facts, S could choose either the dollar or the LC as its functional currency because S has significant activities in both the dollar and the LC, provided that the books and records requirement is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. S, a foreign corporation organized in Country X, is wholly-owned by P, a domestic corporation. S conducts all of its operations through two branches. Branch A is located in Country F and branch B is located in Country G. S, A, and B are QBUs within the meaning of section 989(a). Branch A's and branch B's residences are Country F and Country G respectively as determined under section 988(a)(3)(B). The currency of Country F is the FC and the currency of Country G is the LC. The functional currencies of S, A, and B are determined in a two step procedure.</p><p class="depth0">Step 1: The functional currency of branches A and B. Branch A and branch B both conduct all activities in their respective local currencies. The FC is the currency of branch A and the LC is the currency of branch B under United States generally accepted accounting principles. This determination is based on

facts and circumstances substantially similar to those set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Under these facts, the functional currency of branch A is the FC and the functional currency of branch B is the LC.</p><p class="depth0">Step 2: The functional currency of S. S's functional currency is determined by disregarding the fact that A and B are branches. When A's activities and B's activities are viewed as a whole, S determines that it only conducts significant activities in the LC. Therefore, S's functional currency is the LC. See Examples 9, 10, and 11 for how the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation, which has branches with different functional currencies, are determined.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except that S does not exist and P conducts all of its operations through branch A and branch B. In this instance P's functional currency in Step 2 is the dollar, regardless of the fact that its branches' activities viewed as a whole are in the LC, because P is a taxpayer whose residence is the United States under section 988(a)(3)(B)(i). Therefore, while the functional currency of branch A is the FC and the functional currency of branch B is the LC, the functional currency of P is the dollar because its residence is the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The facts are the same as in Example 7. ln addition, assume that in 1987 branch A has earnings of 100 FC and branch B has earnings of 100 LC as determined under section 987. The weighted average exchange rate for the year is 1 FC/2 LC. Branch A's earnings are translated into 200 LC for purposes of computing S's earnings and profits in 1987. Thus, the total earnings and profits of S from branch A and branch B for 1987 is 300 LC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a foreign corporation organized in Country W, is wholly-owned by P, a domestic corporation. Both X and P are calendar year taxpayers that began business during 1987. X operates exclusively through two branches, A and B both of which are located outside of Country W. The functional currency of X and A is the LC, while the functional currency of B is the DC as determined under section 985 and Sec. 1.985-1. The earnings of B must be computed under section 987, relating to branch transactions. In 1987, A earns 900 LCs of nonsubpart F income and B earns 200 DCs of nonsubpart F income. Under section 904(d)(2), A's income is financial service income and B's income is general limitation income. In order to determine X's earnings and profits, B's income must be translated into LCs (the functional currency of X). The weighted average exchange rate for 1987 is 1 LC/2 DC. Thus, in 1987 X's current earnings and profits (and its post-1986 undistributed earnings) are 1000 LCs consisting of 900 LCs of financial services income earned by A and 100 LCs (200 DC/2) of general limitation income earned by B. Neither A nor B makes any remittances during 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1988, neither A nor B earns any income or generates any loss. On December 31, 1988, A remits 50 LCs directly to P. The remittance to P is considered to be remitted by A to X and then immediately distributed by X as a dividend. The 50 LC remittance does not result in an exchange gain or loss under section 987 to X because the functional currency of X and A is the LC. See section 987(3). Under section 904(d)(3)(D), the 50 LC dividend is treated as income in a separate category to the extent of the dividend's pro rata share of X's earnings and profits in each separate limitation category. Thus, 90 percent, or 45 LCs, is treated as financial services income, and 10 percent, or 5 LCs, is treated as general limitation income. After the dividend distribution, X has 950 LCs of accumulated earnings and profits (and post-1986 undistributed earnings) consisting of 855 LCs of financial service limitation income and 95 LCs of general limitation income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. The facts are the same as in Example 10, except that A makes no remittance during 1988 but B remits 120 DCs to X on December 31, 1988, which X immediately converts into LCs, and X makes no dividend distribution during 1988. Assume that the appropriate exchange rate for the remittance is 1 LC/3 DCs. B's remittance triggers exchange loss to X. See section 987(3). Under section 987, the exchange loss on the remittance is 20 LCs calculated as follows: 40 LCs, which is the LC value of the 120 DC remittance (120 DCs/3), less 60 LCs, their LC basis (120 DCs/2). This loss is sourced and characterized under section 987 and regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. F, a foreign corporation, has gain from the disposition of a United States real property interest (as defined in section 897(c)). The gain is taken into account as if F were engaged in a trade or business within the United States during the taxable year and as if such gain were effectively connected with such trade or business. F's disposition activity shall be treated as a separate QBU with a dollar functional currency because such activity produced income that is treated as effectively connected with a trade or business within the United States. Therefore, F must compute its gain from the disposition by giving the United States real property interest an historic dollar basis.
