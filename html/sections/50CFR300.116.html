                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for use. Within 30 days after NMFS publishes in the Federal Register a list of approved transmitting units and associated communications service providers for the AMLR fishery, an owner or operator of a vessel that has been issued a harvesting permit for AMLR must ensure that such vessel has a NMFS-approved, operating VMS on board when on any fishing trip involving the harvesting of AMLR. An operating VMS includes an operating mobile transmitting unit on the vessel and a functioning communication link between the unit and NMFS as provided by a NMFS-approved communication service provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installing and activating the VMS. Only a VMS that has been approved by NMFS for use in the AMLR fishery may be used. When installing and activating the NMFS-approved VMS, or when reinstalling and reactivating such VMS, the vessel owner or operator must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow procedures indicated on an installation and activation checklist, which is available from OLE; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Submit to OLE a statement certifying compliance with the checklist, as prescribed on the checklist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interference with the VMS. No person may interfere with, tamper with,

alter, damage, disable, or impede the operation of the VMS, or attempt any of the same.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Interruption of operation of the VMS. When a vessel's VMS is not operating properly, the owner or operator must immediately contact OLE, and follow instructions from that office. If notified by NMFS that a vessel's VMS is not operating properly, the owner and operator must follow instructions from that office. In either event, such instructions may include, but are not limited to, manually communicating to a location designated by NMFS the vessel's positions or returning to port until the VMS is operable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access to position data. As a condition of authorized fishing for or possession of AMLR, a vessel owner or operator subject to the requirements for a VMS in this section must allow NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized officers and designees access to the vessel's position data obtained from the VMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Installation and operation of the VMS. NMFS has authority over the installation and operation of the VMS unit. NMFS may authorize the connection or order the disconnection of additional equipment, including a computer, to any VMS unit when deemed appropriate by NMFS.
