                            <p class="depth0">There are three book-entry securities systems--the commercial book- entry system, TreasuryDirect[supreg], and Legacy Treasury  Direct[supreg]--into which we issue marketable Treasury securities. We  maintain and transfer securities in these three book-entry systems  (except that securities may not be transferred into the Legacy Treasury  Direct system) at their par amount. Par amounts of Treasury inflation- protected securities do not include adjustments for inflation.  Securities may be transferred from one system to the other (except that  securities may not be transferred into the Legacy Treasury Direct  system), unless the securities are not eligible to be held in the  receiving system. Securities may be transferred from one system to the  other, unless the securities are not eligible to be held in the  receiving system. See Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal  Service Series No. 2-86, as amended (part 357 of this chapter) and part  363 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The commercial book-entry system. When depository institutions  or dealers submit bids for Treasury securities in an auction, securities  awarded as a result of those bids are generally held in the commercial  book-entry system. Specifically, we maintain book-entry accounts in the  National Book-Entry System [supreg] (``NBES'') for Federal Reserve  Banks, depository institutions, and other authorized entities, such as  government and international agencies and foreign central banks. In  their accounts, depository institutions maintain securities held for  their own account and for the accounts of others. The accounts held for  others include those of other depository institutions and dealers, which  may, in turn, maintain accounts for others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> TreasuryDirect. In this system, account holders maintain  accounts in a book-entry, online system directly on the records of the  Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury. Bids for  securities to be held in TreasuryDirect are submitted through the  Internet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Legacy Treasury Direct. In this system, we maintain the book- entry securities of account holders directly on the records of the  Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury. Bids for  securities to be held in Legacy Treasury Direct are submitted directly  to us. From time to time, Treasury may announce that certain securities  to be offered will not be eligible for purchase or holding in Legacy  Treasury Direct.
