The systems of records for which the exemptions are claimed, the specific exemptions determined to be necessary and proper with respect to these systems of records, the records exempted, the provisions of the act from which they are exempted, and the justifications for the exemptions are set forth below.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific exemptions--(1) Inspector General Investigations Case File Records (OPM/CENTRAL-4). All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. The specific applicability of the exemptions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspector General Investigations Case File Records (OPM/CENTRAL-4).

These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. The specific applicability of the exemptions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspector General investigations may contain properly classified information that pertains to national defense and foreign policy obtained from other systems or another Federal agency. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such classified information under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspector General investigations may contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2); e.g., investigations into the administration of the merit system.

Application of exemption (k)(3) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inspector General case files may contain information that, by statute, is required to be maintained and used solely as a statistical record.

This exemption is claimed because this system contains investigatory material that if disclosed may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the source's identity would be held in confidence or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise. The application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject request access to or amendment of the records, or access to the accounting of disclosures of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of a case file record may relate to testing and examining material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Inspector General case files may contain evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services. Application of exemption (k)(7) may be necessary, but only to the extent that the disclosure of the

data would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administrative Law Judge Applicant Records (OPM/CENTRAL-6). (i) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(3) and (d). The exemptions are claimed because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentialty should the data subject request access to the accounting of disclosures of the record, or access to or amendment of the record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(3) and (d).

To the extent that such exempt material is incorporated into a litigation or claim case file, the appropriate exemption (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7)) shall also apply to the material as it appears in this system.

These investigative records may include material meeting the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7). Such material is exempt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d).

The specific applicability of the exemptions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such investigations may contain properly classified information that pertains to national defense and foreign policy obtained from another Federal agency.

These exemptions are claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7). During the processing of a Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act request (which may include access requests, amendment requests, and requests for review for initial denials of such requests) exempt materials from those other systems may in turn become part of the case record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those other systems are entered into this system, the Office hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those other systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the original primary system of which they are a part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Personnel Investigations Records (OPM/CENTRAL-9).
