                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adoption of program. Each permitting authority shall review its  existing programs, procedures, and criteria for preconstruction review  for conformity   to the requirements established by Secs. 63.40 through 63.44, shall make  any additions and revisions to its existing programs, procedures, and  criteria that the permitting authority deems necessary to properly  effectuate Secs. 63.40 through 63.44, and shall adopt a program to  implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction  of major sources of HAP. As part of the adoption by the permitting  authority of a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to  construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP, the chief  executive officer of the permitting authority shall certify that the  program satisfies all applicable requirements established by Secs. 63.40  through 63.44, and shall specify an effective date for that program  which is not later than June 29, 1998. Prior to the specified effective  date, the permitting authority shall publish a notice stating that the  permitting authority has adopted a program to implement section 112(g)  with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP  and stating the effective date, and shall provide a written description  of the program to the Administrator through the appropriate EPA Regional  Office. Nothing in this section shall be construed either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To require that any owner or operator of a stationary source  comply with any requirement adopted by the permitting authority which is  not intended to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or  reconstruction of major sources of HAP; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To preclude the permitting authority from enforcing any  requirements not intended to implement section 112(g) with respect to  construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP under any other  provision of applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to adopt program. In the event that the permitting  authority fails to adopt a program to implement section 112(g) with  respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources of HAP with  an effective date on or before June 29, 1998, and the permitting  authority concludes that it is able to make case-by-case MACT  determinations which conform to the provisions of Sec. 63.43 in the  absence of such a program, the permitting authority may elect to make  such determinations. However, in those instances where the permitting  authority elects to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence  of a program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or  reconstruction of major sources of HAP, no such case-by-case MACT  determination shall take effect until after it has been submitted by the  permitting authority in writing to the appropriate EPA Regional  Adminstrator and the EPA Regional Administrator has concurred in writing  that the case-by-case MACT determination by the permitting authority is  in conformity with all requirements established by Secs. 63.40 through  63.44. In the event that the permitting authority fails to adopt a  program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or  reconstruction of major sources of HAP with an effective date on or  before June 29, 1998, and the permitting authority concludes that it is  unable to make case-by-case MACT determinations in the absence of such a  program, the permitting authority may request that the EPA Regional  Administrator implement a transitional program to implement section  112(g) with respect to construction or reconstruction of major sources  of HAP in the affected State of local jurisdiction while the permitting  authority completes development and adoption of a section 112(g)  program. Any such transitional section 112(g) program implemented by the  EPA Regional Administrator shall conform to all requirements established  by Secs. 63.40 through 63.44, and shall remain in effect for no more  than 30 months. Continued failure by the permitting authority to adopt a  program to implement section 112(g) with respect to construction or  reconstruction of major sources of HAP shall be construed as a failure  by the permitting authority to adequately administer and enforce its  title V permitting program and shall constitute cause by EPA to apply  the sanctions and remedies set forth in the Clean Air Act section  502(I).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prohibition. After the effective date of section 112(g)(2)(B)  (as defined in Sec. 63.41) in a State or local jurisdiction and the  effective date of the title V permit program applicable to that State or  local jurisdiction, no person   may begin actual construction or reconstruction of a major source of HAP  in such State or local jurisdiction unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The major source in question has been specifically regulated or  exempted from regulation under a standard issued pursuant to section  112(d), section 112(h) or section 112(j) in part 63, and the owner and  operator has fully complied with all procedures and requirements for  preconstruction review established by that standard, including any  applicable requirements set forth in subpart A of this part 63; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The permitting authority has made a final and effective case-by- case determination pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 63.43 such that  emissions from the constructed or reconstructed major source will be  controlled to a level no less stringent than the maximum achievable  control technology emission limitation for new sources.
