The Agency shall make payments based on the biorefinery's expenditures on eligible project costs. To request payments under this program during a fiscal year, an eligible biorefinery must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submit an original, validly signed and completed SF 271 to the Agency not more frequently than once a month with the following supporting documentation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evidence of expenditure of funds on eligible project costs which shall include paid third party invoices, receipts, bills of sale, and/or payroll records. Such records must be adequate to identify that funds to be reimbursed were spent on eligible project costs; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence that construction of the repowering project is in compliance with the project development schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certify that the request is accurate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Furnish the Agency such certifications as required in Form RD 4288-4, Part C, and access to records that verify compliance with program provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Clarifying information. After payment applications are submitted, eligible biorefineries may be required to submit additional supporting clarification if their original submittal is not sufficient to verify eligibility for payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. The Agency will notify the biorefinery, in writing, whenever the Agency determines that a payment request is ineligible and why the request was determined ineligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refunds and interest payments. An eligible biorefinery that has received a payment under this program may be required to refund such payment as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An eligible biorefinery receiving payment under this program will become ineligible for payments if the Agency determines the biorefinery has:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Made any material fraudulent representation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Misrepresented any material fact affecting a program determination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upon completion of the repowering project, failed to reduce its

If a refund is not made promptly, the Agency may use all remedies available to it, including Treasury offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, financial judgment against the biorefinery, and sharing information with the Department of Justice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Late payment interest will be assessed on each refund in accordance with provisions and rates as determined by the Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest charged by the Agency under this program will be at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. Interest will accrue from the date payments were received by the biorefinery to the date of repayment, and the rate will adjust in accordance with applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Agency may waive the accrual of interest and/or damages if the Agency determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any fraudulent or negligent action of the biorefinery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A biorefinery or person receiving payment under this program will be liable for any refund or related charges associated with their project due under this program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Remedies.
