                            <p class="depth0">When a request is received in a Department of Veterans Affairs regional office, center, or medical center from the commanding officer of a State soldiers' home for information other than information relative to the character of the discharge from a Department of Veterans Affairs center or medical center concerning a veteran formerly domiciled or hospitalized therein, the provisions of Sec.  1.500 are applicable, and no disclosure will be made unless the request is accompanied by the authorization outlined in Sec.  1.503. However, station heads, upon receipt of a request from the commanding officer of a State soldiers' home for the character of the discharge of a veteran from a period of hospital treatment or domiciliary care as a beneficiary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, will comply with the request, restricting the information disclosed solely to the character of the veteran's discharge from such treatment or care. Such information will be disclosed only upon receipt of a specific request therefor from the commanding officer of a State soldiers' home.
