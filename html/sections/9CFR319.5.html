                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mechanically Separated (Species) is any finely comminuted  product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of  the bone from attached skeletal muscle of livestock carcasses and parts  of carcasses and meeting the other provisions of this paragraph.  Examples of such product are ``Mechanically Separated Beef'',  ``Mechanically Separated Veal'', ``Mechanically Separated Pork'', and  ``Mechanically Separated Lamb''. At least 98 percent of the bone  particles present in such product shall have a maximum size no greater  than 0.5 millimeter in their greatest dimension and there shall be no  bone particles larger than 0.85 millimeter in their greatest dimension.  The product resulting from the separating process shall not have a  calcium content exceeding 0.75 percent, as a measure of a bone solids  content of not more than 3 percent, and shall have a minimum PER of 2.5  (except as modified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section). Such product  also shall have a protein content of not less than 14 percent and a fat  content of not more than 30 percent, or it shall be deemed to be product  for processing. Such product failing to meet the bone particle size,  calcium, or PER requirements of this paragraph shall only be used in  producing animal fats. Where such product meets the bone particle size,  calcium, and PER requirements of this paragraph, it may also be used in  the formulation of meat food products in accordance with Sec. 319.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mechanically Separated (Beef) is inedible and prohibited for use  as human food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)-(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the  total amino acids presents in ``Mechanically Separated (Species)'' shall  be accepted as evidence of compliance with the protein quality  requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of  this paragraph, essential amino acid content includes isoleucine,  leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine  content, and the total amino acids present include isoleucine, leucine,  lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, tyrosine,  arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine,  proline, serine, and hydroxyproline content.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Analytical methods used by establishments in verifying the fat,  protein, and calcium content of product consisting of or containing  Mechanically Separated (Species) shall be among those listed in  ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical  Chemists (AOAC),'' 16th edition, 1995, Sec. Sec. 960.39, 976.21, 928.08  (Chapter 39), and 940.33 (Chapter 45), which is incorporated by  reference, or, if no AOAC method is available, in the ``Chemistry  Laboratory Guidebook,'' U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington,  D.C., March 1986 edition, sections 6.011-6.013, Revised June 1987 (pages  6-35 through 6-65), or by appropriate methods validated by scientific   bodies in collaborative trials. The ``Official Methods of Analysis of  the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' Chapter 39 and  Chapter 45, subsection 45.2.06 (AOAC Official Method 940.33), 16th  edition, 1995, are incorporated by reference with the approval of the  Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and  1 CFR Part 51.
