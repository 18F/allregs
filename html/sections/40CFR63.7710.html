                                Sec. 63.7710  What are my operation and maintenance requirements?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As required by Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and maintain your iron and steel foundry, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written operation and maintenance plan for each capture and collection system and control device for an emissions source subject to a PM, metal HAP, TEA, or VOHAP emissions limit in Sec. 63.7690(a). Your operation and maintenance plan also must include procedures for igniting gases from mold vents in pouring areas and pouring stations that use a sand mold system. This operation and maintenance plan is subject to approval by the Administrator. Each plan must contain the elements described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monthly inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection must include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in the ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in the ductwork, and fan erosion). The operation and maintenance plan must also include requirements to repair the defect or deficiency as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating limits for each capture system for an emissions source subject to an emissions limit or standard for VOHAP or TEA in Sec. 63.7690(a)(8) through (11). You must establish the operating according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Select operating limit parameters appropriate for the capture system design that are representative and reliable indicators of the performance of the capture system. At a minimum, you must use appropriate operating limit parameters that indicate the

level of the ventilation draft and damper position settings for the capture system when operating to collect emissions, including revised settings for seasonal variations. Appropriate operating limit parameters for ventilation draft include, but are not limited to: volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood, total volumetric flow rate at the inlet to the control device to which the capture system is vented, fan motor amperage, or static pressure. Any parameter for damper position setting may be used that indicates the duct damper position related to the fully open setting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each operating limit parameter selected in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during the process operation. If your operation allows for more than one process to be operating simultaneously, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during each possible configuration that you may operate (i.e., the operating limits with one furnace melting, two melting, as applicable to your plant).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include documentation in your plan to support your selection of the operating limits established for your capture system. This documentation must include a description of the capture system design, a description of the capture system operating during production, a description of each selected operating limit parameter, a rationale for why you chose the parameter, a description of the method used to monitor the parameter according to the requirements of Sec. 63.7740(a), and the data used to set the value or setting for the parameter for each of your process configurations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Preventative maintenance plan for each control device, including a preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. For each bag leak detection system that operates on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan must be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-98-015). This baghouse monitoring plan is subject to approval by the Administrator. The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan must address all of the items identified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Installation of the bag leak detection system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Corrective action plan for each baghouse. The plan must include the requirement that, in the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered, you must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the alarm within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the corrective action as soon as practicable. Corrective actions taken may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Making process changes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Shutting down the process producing the PM emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Procedures for providing an ignition source to mold vents of sand mold

systems in each pouring area and pouring station unless you determine the mold vent gases either are not ignitable, ignite automatically, or cannot be ignited due to accessibility or safety issues. You must document and maintain records of this determination. The determination of ignitability, accessibility, and safety may encompass multiple casting patterns provided the castings utilize similar sand-to-metal ratios, binder formulations, and coating materials. The determination of ignitability must be based on observations of the mold vents within 5 minutes of pouring, and the flame must be present for at least 15 seconds for the mold vent to be considered ignited. For the purpose of this determination:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mold vents that ignite more than 75 percent of the time without the presence of an auxiliary ignition source are considered to ignite automatically; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mold vents that do not ignite automatically and cannot be ignited in the presence of an auxiliary ignition source more than 25 percent of the time are considered to be not ignitable.
