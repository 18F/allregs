                            <p class="depth0">The contracting officer may insert a clause substantially the same  as the clause at 52.243-7, Notification of Changes, in solicitations and  contracts. The clause is available for use primarily in negotiated  research and development or supply contracts for the acquisition of  major weapon systems or principal subsystems. If the contract amount is  expected to be less than $1,000,000, the clause shall not be used,  unless the contracting officer anticipates that situations will arise  that may result in a contractor alleging that the Government has  effected changes other than those identified as such in writing and  signed by the contracting officer.
