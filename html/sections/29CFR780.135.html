                                Sec. 780.135  Meaning of ``farm.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A ``farm'' is a tract of land devoted to the actual farming activities included in the first part of section 3(f). Thus, the gathering of wild plants in the woods for transplantation in a nursery is not an operation performed ``on a farm.'' (For a further discussion, see Sec. 780.207.) The total area of a tract operated as a unit for farming purposes is included in the ``farm,'' irrespective of the fact that some of this area may not be utilized for actual farming operations (see NLRB v. Olaa Sugar Co., 242 F. 2d 714; In re Princeville Canning Co., 14 WH Cases 641 and 762). It is immaterial whether a farm is situated in the city or in the country. However, a place in a city where no primary farming operations are performed is not a farm even if operated by a farmer (Mitchell v. Huntsville Nurseries, 267 F. 2d 286).</p>
