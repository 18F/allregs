                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(8)</em>. Such loss, however, does reduce  the amount which a trust is required to distribute as dividends. For  purposes of applying the provisions of the Code, other than those  provisions of part II of subchapter M which relate to prohibited  transactions, no inference is to be drawn from the fact that a type of  transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special rules. In determining whether a particular transaction  constitutes a prohibited transaction, the activities of a real estate  investment trust with respect to foreclosure property and its sales of  such property are disregarded. Also, if a real estate investment trust  enters into a purchase and leaseback of real property with an option in  the seller-lessee to repurchase the property at the end of the lease  period, and the seller exercises the option pursuant to its terms,  income from the sale generally will not be considered to be income from  a prohibited transaction solely because the purchase and leaseback was  entered into with an option in the seller to repurchase and because the  option was exercised pursuant to its terms. Other facts and  circumstances, however, may require a conclusion that the property is  held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade  or business. Gain from the sale or other disposition of property  described in section 1221(1) (other than foreclosure property) that is  included in gross income for a taxable year of a qualified real estate  investment trust constitutes income from a prohibited transaction, even  though the sale or other disposition from which the gain is derived  occurred in a prior taxable year. For example, if a corporation that is  a qualified real estate investment trust for the current taxable year  elected to report the income from the sale of an item of section 1221(1)  property (other than foreclosure property) on the installment method of  reporting income, the gain from the sale that is taken into income by  the real estate investment trust for the current taxable year is income  from a prohibited transaction. This result follows even though the sale  occurred in a prior taxable year for which the corporation did not  qualify as a real estate investment trust. On the other hand, if the  gain is taken into income in a taxable year for which the taxpayer is  not a qualifed real estate investment trust, the 100-percent tax does  not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c))</em>; sec. 859(e) (90 Stat. 1744; 26 U.S.C. 859(e));  sec. 6001 (68A Stat. 731; 26 U.S.C. 6001); sec. 6011 (68A Stat. 732; 26  U.S.C. 6011); sec. 6071 (68A Stat. 749, 26 U.S.C. 6071); sec. 6091 (68A  Stat. 752; 26 U.S.C. 6091); sec. 7805 (68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805),  Internal Revenue Code of 1954))  [T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11278, Feb. 6, 1981]</p>
