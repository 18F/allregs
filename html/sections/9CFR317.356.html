The terms ``light'' or ``lite'' may be used on  the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as  defined in Sec. 317.313(l) and main-dish products as defined in Sec.  317.313(m), without further qualification, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the product derives less than 50 percent of its calories from  fat:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of calories is reduced by at least one-third (33\1/3\  percent) per reference amount customarily consumed compared to an  appropriate reference product as described in Sec. 317.313(j)(1);
