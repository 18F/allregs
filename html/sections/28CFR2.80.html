                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicability in general. Except as provided below, the  guidelines in paragraphs (b)-(n) of this section apply at an initial  hearing or rehearing conducted for any prisoner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reparole decisions. Reparole decisions shall be made in  accordance with Sec.  2.81.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Youth offenders. A prisoner sentenced under the Youth  Rehabilitation Act shall be considered for parole under these guidelines  pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that the prisoner  shall be given rehearings in accordance with the schedule at Sec.   2.75(a)(2)(ii) and the prisoner's program achievements shall be  considered in the parole release decision in accordance with Sec.   2.106. The guidelines at paragraphs (k)-(m) of this section for awarding  superior program achievement and subtracting the award in determining  the total guideline range shall not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prisoners considered under the guidelines of the former District  of Columbia Board of Parole. For a prisoner whose initial hearing was  held before August 5, 1998, the Commission shall render its decision by  reference to the guidelines of the former D.C. Board of Parole in effect  on August 4, 1998. However, when a decision outside such guidelines has  been made by the Board, or is ordered by the Commission, the Commission  may determine the appropriateness and extent of the departure by  comparison with the guidelines of Sec.  2.80. The Commission may also  correct any error in the calculation of the D.C. Board's guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prisoners given initial hearings under the guidelines in effect  from August 5, 1998 through December 3, 2000 (the guidelines formerly  found in 28 CFR 2.80, Appendix to Sec.  2.80 (2000)). For a prisoner  given an initial hearing under the Sec.  2.80 guidelines in effect from  August 5, 1998 through December 3, 2000, the guidelines in paragraphs  (b)-(n) of this section shall be applied retroactively subject to the  provisions of paragraph (o) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Guidelines. In determining whether an eligible prisoner should  be paroled, the Commission shall apply the guidelines set forth in this  section. The guidelines assign numerical values to pre-and post- incarceration factors. Decisions outside the guidelines may be made,  where warranted, pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Salient factor score and criminal record. The prisoner's Salient  Factor Score shall be determined by reference to the Salient Factor  Scoring Manual in Sec.  2.20. The Salient Factor Score is used to assist  the Commission in assessing the probability that an offender will live  and remain at liberty without violating the law. The prisoner's record  of criminal conduct (including the nature and circumstances of the  current offense) shall be used to assist the Commission in determining  the probable seriousness of the recidivism that is predicted by the  Salient Factor Score.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disciplinary infractions. The Commission shall assess whether  the prisoner has been found guilty of committing significant  disciplinary infractions while under confinement for the current  offense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Program achievement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission shall assess whether the  prisoner has demonstrated ordinary or superior achievement in the area  of prison programs, industries, or work assignments while under  confinement for the current offense. Superior program achievement means  program achievement that is beyond the level that the prisoner might  ordinarily be expected to accomplish. Credit for program achievement may  be granted regardless of whether the guidelines for disciplinary  infractions have been applied for misconduct during the same period. The  guidelines in this section presume that the prisoner will have ordinary  program achievement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a prisoner who has declined to participate in  institutional programming, a decision in the upper half of the  applicable guideline range generally will be warranted, except that in  the case of a prisoner who has a base point score of 3 or less, or who   has a criminal record involving violence or sexual offenses and who has  not participated in available programming to address a potential for  criminal behavior of a violent or sexual nature, a decision above the  guidelines may be warranted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Base point score.

In probation  violation cases, the current offense includes both the original offense  and the violation offense, except that the original offense shall be  scored as a prior conviction (with a prior commitment) rather than as  part of the current offense, if the prisoner served more than six months  in prison for the original offense before his probation commenced</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Category IIE applies whenever a firearm is possessed by the  offender during, or is used by the offender to commit, any offense that  is not scored under Category II(A-D). Category IIE also applies when the  current offense is felony unlawful possession of a firearm and there is  no other current offense. Possession for purposes of Category IIE  includes constructive possession.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Category IIIA applies if the death of a victim is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Caused by the offender, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Caused by an accomplice and the killing was planned or approved  by the offender in furtherance of a joint criminal venture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Determining the base guideline range.

Determine the total number of  months until parole eligibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Guideline range for disciplinary infractions. Determine the  applicable guideline range from Sec.  2.36 for any significant  disciplinary infractions since the beginning of confinement on the  current offense in the case of an initial hearing, and since the last  hearing in the case of a rehearing. If there are no significant  disciplinary infractions, this step is not applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Guidelines for superior program achievement. If superior program  achievement is found, the award for superior program achievement shall  be one-third of the number of months during which the prisoner  demonstrated superior program achievement. The award is determined on  the basis of all time in confinement on the current offense in the case  of an initial hearing, and on the basis of time in confinement since the  last hearing in the case of a rehearing. If superior program achievement  is not found, this step is not applicable.</p><p class="depth2">Note: When superior program achievement is found, it is presumed  that the award will be based on the total number of months since the  beginning of confinement on the current offense in the case of an  initial hearing, or since the last hearing in the case of a rehearing.  Where, however, the Commission determines that the prisoner did not have  superior program achievement during the entire period, it may base its  decision solely on the number of months during which the prisoner had  superior program achievement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Determining the total guideline range at an initial hearing. At  an initial hearing</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add together the minimum of the base point guideline range (from  paragraph (h) of this section), the number of months required by the  prisoner's parole eligibility date (from (i) of this section), and the  minimum of the guideline range for disciplinary infractions, if  applicable (from paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award  for superior program achievement, if applicable (from paragraph (k) of  this section). The result is the minimum of the Total Guideline Range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add together the maximum of the base point guideline range (from  paragraph (h) of this section), the number of months required by the  prisoner's parole eligibility date (from paragraph (i) of this section),  and the maximum of the guideline range for disciplinary infractions, if  applicable (from paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award  for superior program achievement, if applicable (from paragraph (k) of  this section). The result is the maximum of the Total Guideline Range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Determining the total guideline range at a reconsideration  hearing. At a reconsideration hearing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Add together the minimum of the Total Guideline Range from the  previous hearing, and the minimum of the guideline range for  disciplinary infractions since the previous hearing, if applicable (from  paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award for superior  program achievement, if applicable (from paragraph (k) of this section).  The result is the minimum of the Total Guideline Range for the current  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Add together the maximum of the Total Guideline Range from the  previous hearing, and the maximum of the guideline range for  disciplinary infractions since the previous hearing, if applicable (from  paragraph (j) of this section). Then subtract the award for superior  program achievement since the previous hearing, if applicable (from  paragraph (k) of this section). The result is the maximum of the Total  Guideline Range for the current hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Decisions outside the guidelines. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission may, in  unusual circumstances, grant or deny parole to a prisoner  notwithstanding the guidelines. Unusual circumstances are case-specific  factors that are not fully taken into account in the guidelines, and  that are relevant to the grant or denial of parole. In such cases, the  Commission shall specify in the notice of action the specific factors  that it relied on in departing from the applicable guideline or  guideline range. If the prisoner is deemed to be a poorer or more  serious risk than the guidelines indicate, the Commission shall  determine what Base Point Score would more appropriately fit the  prisoner's case, and shall render its initial and rehearing decisions as  if the prisoner had that higher Base Point Score. It is to be noted  that, in some cases, an extreme level of risk presented by the prisoner  may make it inappropriate for the Commission to contemplate a parole at  any hearing without a significant change in the prisoner's  circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factors that may warrant a decision above the guidelines  include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Poorer parole risk than indicated by salient factor score. The  offender is a poorer parole risk than indicated by the salient factor  score because of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Unusually persistent failure under supervision (pretrial  release, probation, or parole);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Unusually persistent history of criminally related substance  (drug or alcohol) abuse and resistance to treatment efforts; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Unusually extensive prior record (sufficient to make the  offender a poorer risk than the ``poor'' prognosis category).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> More serious parole risk. The offender is a more serious parole  risk than indicated by the total point score because of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Prior record of violence more extensive or serious than that  taken into account in the guidelines;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Current offense demonstrates extraordinary criminal  sophistication, criminal professionalism in the employment of violence  or threats of violence, or leadership role in instigating others to  commit a serious offense;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Unusual cruelty to the victim (beyond that accounted for by  scoring the offense as high level violence), or predation upon extremely  vulnerable victim;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Unusual propensity to inflict unprovoked and potentially  homicidal violence, as demonstrated by the circumstances of the current  offense; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Additional serious offense(s) committed after (or while on bond  or fugitive status from) current offense that show unusual capacity for  sustained, repeated violent criminal activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Factors that may warrant a decision below the guidelines  include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Better parole risk than indicated by salient factor score. The  offender is a better parole risk than indicated by the salient factor  score because of (applicable only to offenders who are not already in  the very good risk category)--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A prior criminal record resulting exclusively from minor  offenses;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A substantial crime-free period in the community for which  credit is not already given on the Salient Factor Score;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A change in the availability of community resources leading to a  better parole prognosis;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Other factors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Unusually lengthy period of incarceration on the minimum  sentence (in relation to the seriousness of the offense and prior  record) that warrants an initial parole determination as if the offender  were being considered at a rehearing;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Substantial period in custody on other sentence(s) sufficient to  warrant a finding in paragraph (n)(3) of this section; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Clearly exceptional program achievement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A prisoner who is eligible under the criteria of paragraph  (o)(2) may receive a parole determination using the 1987 guidelines of  the former District of Columbia Board of Parole (hereinafter ``the 1987  Board guidelines'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A prisoner must satisfy the following criteria to obtain a  determination using the 1987 Board guidelines:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The prisoner committed the offense of conviction after March 3,  1985 and before August 5, 1998;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The prisoner is not incarcerated as a parole violator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The prisoner received his initial hearing after August 4,  1998; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The prisoner does not have a parole effective date, or a  presumptive parole date before January 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For a prisoner eligible for application of the 1987 Board  guidelines, a hearing examiner shall first review the case on the  record. If the hearing examiner recommends that the prisoner receive a  parole effective date and the Commission concurs in the recommendation,  the case shall not be scheduled for a hearing. If the hearing examiner  does not recommend a parole effective date, a hearing shall be conducted  on an appropriate hearing docket.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At the hearing, the hearing examiner shall evaluate the  prisoner's case using the 1987 Board guidelines, as if the prisoner were  receiving an initial hearing. If appropriate, the hearing examiner shall  evaluate the case using the 1987 Board guidelines for rehearings,  revising the initial point score based on the prisoner's prison conduct  record and program performance. The Commission shall use the former  Board's policy guidelines in making its determinations under this  paragraph, according to the policy guideline in effect at the time of  the prisoner's offense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the Commission denies parole after the hearing, and the  prisoner received a presumptive parole date under the parole  determination that preceded the hearing under this paragraph, the  prisoner shall not forfeit the presumptive parole date unless the  presumptive date is rescinded for institutional misconduct, new criminal  conduct, or for new adverse information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Decisions resulting from hearings under this paragraph may not  be appealed to the Commission.  [65 FR 70665, Nov. 27, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 67946, Sept. 13, 2002;  74 FR 34690, July 17, 2009; 74 FR 58543, Nov. 13, 2009]</p>
