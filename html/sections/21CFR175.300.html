Using table 2 (paragraph (d) of this section), select the  food-simulating solvent or solvents (demineralized distilled water,  heptane, and/or 8 percent ethyl alcohol) and the time-temperature  exaggerations of the container-use conditions. Aqueous products (Types  I, II, IV-B, and VI-B) require only a water-extractability test at the  temperature and time conditions shown for the most severe ``conditions  of use.'' Aqueous products with free oil or fat, and water-oil emulsions  (types III, IV-A, and VII) will require determinations of both water  extractability and heptane extractability. Low-moisture fats and oils  (type V with no free water) require only the heptane extractability.  Alcoholic beverages (type VI-A) require only the 8 percent alcohol  extractant. Having selected the appropriate extractant or extractants  simulating various types of foods and beverages and the time-temperature  exaggerations over normal use, follow the applicable extraction  procedure. Adapt the procedure, when necessary, for containers having a  capacity of over 1 gallon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Selection of coated-container samples. For consumer-sized  containers up to 1 gallon, quadruplicate samples of representative  containers (using for each replicate sample the number of containers  nearest to an area of 180 square inches) should be selected from the lot  to be examined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cleaning procedure preliminary to determining the amount of  extractables from coated containers. Quadruplicate samples of  representative containers should be selected from the lot to be examined  and must be carefully rinsed to remove extraneous material prior to the  actual extraction procedure. Soda fountain pressure-type hot water  rinsing equipment, consisting in its simplest form of a \1/8\-inch-\1/ 4\-inch internal diameter metal tube attached to a hot water line and  bent so as to direct a stream of water upward, may be used. Be sure hot  water has reached a temperature of 190 F-200 F before starting to  rinse the container. Invert the container over the top of the fountain  and direct a strong stream of hot water against the bottom and all sides  for 1 minute, drain, and allow to dry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exposure conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Water (250 F for 2 hours), simulating  high-temperature heat sterilization.
