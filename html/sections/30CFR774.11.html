We must enter the results of each enforcement action,  including administrative and judicial decisions, into AVS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> are met. In  making a finding under this paragraph, we will only consider control  relationships and violations which would make, or would have made, you  ineligible for a permit under Sec. Sec. 773.12(a) and (b) of this  subchapter. We must make a preliminary finding of permanent permit  ineligibility if we find that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You control or have controlled surface coal mining and  reclamation operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations  under section 510(c) of the Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The violations are of such nature and duration with such  resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate your  intent not to comply with the Act, its implementing regulations, the  regulatory program, or your permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may request a hearing on a preliminary finding of permanent  permit ineligibility under 43 CFR 4.1350 through 4.1356.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Entry into AVS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you do not request a hearing, and the time for seeking a  hearing has   expired, we will enter our finding into AVS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you request a hearing, we will enter our finding into AVS  only if that finding is upheld on administrative appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> At any time, we may identify any person who owns or controls an  entire surface coal mining operation or any relevant portion or aspect  thereof. If we identify such a person, we must issue a written  preliminary finding to the person and the applicant or permittee  describing the nature and extent of ownership or control. Our written  preliminary finding must be based on evidence sufficient to establish a  prima facie case of ownership or control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> After we issue a written preliminary finding under paragraph (f)  of this section, we will allow you, the person subject to the  preliminary finding, 30 days in which to submit any information tending  to demonstrate your lack of ownership or control. If, after reviewing  any information you submit, we are persuaded that you are not an owner  or controller, we will serve you a written notice to that effect. If,  after reviewing any information you submit, we still find that you are  an owner or controller, or if you do not submit any information within  the 30-day period, we will issue a written finding and enter our finding  into AVS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If we identify you as an owner or controller under paragraph (g)  of this section, you may challenge the finding using the provisions of  Sec. Sec. 773.25, 773.26, and 773.27 of this subchapter.  [65 FR 79667, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 72 FR 68030, Dec. 3, 2007]</p>
