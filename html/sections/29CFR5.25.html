                                Sec. 5.25  Rate of contribution or cost for fringe benefits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under the amendments, the Secretary is obligated to make a  separate finding of the rate of contribution or cost of fringe benefits.  Only the amount of contributions or costs for fringe benefits which meet  the requirements of the act will be considered by the Secretary. These  requirements are discussed in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The rate of contribution or cost is ordinarily an hourly rate,  and will be reflected in the wage determination as such. In some cases,  however, the contribution or cost for certain fringe benefits may be  expressed in a formula or method of payment other than an hourly rate.  In such cases, the Secretary may in his discretion express in the wage  determination the rate of contribution or cost used in the formula or  method or may convert it to an hourly rate of pay whenever he finds that  such action would facilitate the administration of the Act. See Sec.  5.5(a)(1)(i) and (iii).    Sec. 5.26  ``* * * contribution irrevocably made * * * to a trustee or to a third person''.</p><p class="depth2">Under the fringe benefits provisions (section 1(b)(2) of the Act)  the amount of contributions for fringe benefits must be made to a  trustee or to a third person irrevocably. The ``third person'' must be  one who is not affiliated with the contractor or subcontractor. The  trustee must assume the usual fiduciary responsibilities imposed upon  trustees by applicable law. The trust or fund must be set up in such a  way that in no event will the contractor or subcontractor be able to  recapture any of the contributions paid in or any way divert the funds  to his own use or benefit. Although contributions made to a trustee or  third person pursuant to a benefit plan must be irrevocably made, this  does not prevent return to the contractor or subcontractor of sums which  he had paid in excess of the contributions actually called for by the  plan, as where such excess payments result from error or from the  necessity of making payments to cover the estimated cost of  contributions at a time when the exact amount of the necessary  contributions under the plan is not yet ascertained. For example, a  benefit plan may provide for definite insurance benefits for employees  in the event of the happening of a specified contingency such as death,  sickness, accident, etc., and may provide that the cost of such definite  benefits, either in full or any balance in excess of specified employee  contributions, will be borne by the contractor or subcontractor. In such  a case the return by the insurance company to the contractor or  subcontractor of sums paid by him in excess of the amount required to  provide the benefits which, under the plan, are to be provided through  contributions by the contractor or subcontractor, will not be deemed a  recapture or diversion by the employer of contributions made pursuant to  the plan. (See Report of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public  Welfare, S. Rep. No. 963, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 5.)    Sec. 5.27  ``* * * fund, plan, or program''.</p><p class="depth2">The contributions for fringe benefits must be made pursuant to a  fund, plan or program (sec. 1(b)(2)(A) of the act). The phrase ``fund,  plan, or program'' is merely intended to recognize the various types of  arrangements commonly used to provide fringe benefits through employer  contributions. The phrase is identical with language contained in  section 3(1) of the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act. In  interpreting this phrase, the Secretary will be guided by the experience  of the Department in administering the latter statute. (See Report of  Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, S. Rep. No. 963, 88th  Cong., 2d Sess., p. 5.)</p>
