                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to the EAR--Definition. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Subject to the EAR'' is a  term used in the EAR to describe those items and activities over which  BIS exercises regulatory jurisdiction under the EAR. Conversely, items  and activities that are not subject to the EAR are outside the  regulatory jurisdiction of the EAR and are not affected by these  regulations. The items and activities subject to the EAR are described  in Sec. Sec. 734.2 through 734.5 of this part. You should review the  Commerce Control List (CCL) and any applicable parts of the EAR to  determine whether an item or activity is subject to the EAR. However, if  you need help in determining whether an item or activity is subject to  the EAR, see Sec. 734.6 of this part. Publicly available technology and  software not subject to the EAR are described in Sec. Sec. 734.7  through 734.11 and supplement no. 1 to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Items and activities subject to the EAR may also be controlled  under export-related programs administered by other agencies. Items and  activities subject to the EAR are not necessarily exempted from the  control programs of other agencies. Although BIS and other agencies that  maintain controls for national security and foreign policy reasons try  to minimize overlapping jurisdiction, you should be aware that in some  instances you may have to comply with more than one regulatory program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term ``subject to the EAR'' should not be confused with  licensing or other requirements imposed in other parts of the EAR. Just  because an item or activity is subject to the EAR does not mean that a  license or other requirement automatically applies. A license or other  requirement applies only in those cases where other parts of the EAR  impose a licensing or other requirement on such items or activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Export and reexport--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition of export. ``Export'' means  an actual shipment or transmission of items subject to the EAR out of  the United States, or release of technology or software subject to the  EAR to a foreign national in the United States, as described in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See paragraph (b)(9) of this  section for the definition that applies to exports of encryption source  code and object code software subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Export of technology or software. (See paragraph (b)(9) for  provisions that apply to encryption source code and object code  software.) ``Export'' of technology or software, excluding encryption  software subject to ``EI'' controls, includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any release of technology or software subject to the EAR in a  foreign country; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to  a foreign national. Such release is deemed to be an export to the home  country or countries of the foreign national. This deemed export rule  does not apply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence in  the United States and does not apply to persons who are protected  individuals under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C.  1324b(a)(3)). Note that the release of any item to any party with  knowledge a violation is about to occur is prohibited by Sec.  736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definition of ``release'' of technology or software. Technology  or software is ``released'' for export through:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-origin equipment  and facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or  technical experience acquired in the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Definition of reexport. ``Reexport'' means an actual shipment or  transmission of items subject to the EAR from one foreign country to  another foreign country; or release of technology or software subject to  the EAR to a foreign national outside the United States, as described in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reexport of technology or software. Any release of technology or  source code subject to the EAR to a foreign national of another country  is a deemed reexport to the home country or countries of the foreign  national. However, this deemed reexport definition does not apply to  persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The term ``release''  is defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Note that the release of  any item to any party with knowledge or reason to know a violation is  about to occur is prohibited by Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For purposes of the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject  to the EAR that will transit through a country or countries or be  transshipped in a country or countries to a new country or are intended  for reexport to the new country, are deemed to be exports to the new  country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If a territory, possession, or department of a foreign country  is not listed on the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of  the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject to the EAR to such  destination is deemed under the EAR to be an export to the foreign  country. For example, a shipment to the Cayman Islands, a dependent  territory of the United Kingdom, is deemed to be a shipment to the  United Kingdom.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Export or reexport of items subject to the EAR does not include  shipments among any of the states of the United States, the Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or  any territory, dependency, or possession of the United States. These  destinations are listed in Schedule C, Classification Codes and  Descriptions for U.S. Export Statistics, issued by the Bureau of the  Census.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Export of encryption source code and object code software. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  For purposes of the EAR, the export of encryption source code and object  code software means:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An actual shipment, transfer, or transmission out of the United  States (see also paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A transfer of such software in the United States to an embassy  or affiliate of a foreign country.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The export of encryption source code and object code software  controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control  List (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) includes downloading,  or causing the downloading of, such software to locations (including  electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer protocol, and World  Wide Web sites) outside the U.S., or making such software available for  transfer outside the United States, over wire, cable, radio, electro- magnetic, photo optical, photoelectric or other comparable  communications facilities accessible to persons outside the United  States, including transfers from electronic bulletin boards, Internet  file transfer protocol and World Wide Web sites, unless the person  making the software available takes precautions adequate to prevent  unauthorized transfer of such code. See Sec. 740.13(e) of the EAR for  notification requirements for exports or reexports of encryption source  code software considered to be publicly available consistent with the  provisions of Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR. Publicly available  encryption software in object code that corresponds to encryption source  code made eligible for License Exception TSU under section 740.13(e) is  not subject to the EAR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Subject to the General Prohibitions described in part 736 of  the EAR, such precautions for Internet transfers of products eligible  for export under Sec. 740.17 (b)(2) of the EAR (encryption software  products, certain encryption source code and general purpose encryption  toolkits) shall include such measures as:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The access control system, either through automated means or  human intervention, checks the address of every system outside of the  U.S. or Canada requesting or receiving a transfer and verifies such  systems do not   have a domain name or Internet address of a foreign government end-user  (e.g., ``.gov,'' ``.gouv,'' ``.mil'' or similar addresses);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The access control system provides every requesting or receiving  party with notice that the transfer includes or would include  cryptographic software subject to export controls under the Export  Administration Regulations, and anyone receiving such a transfer cannot  export the software without a license or other authorization; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Every party requesting or receiving a transfer of such software  must acknowledge affirmatively that the software is not intended for use  by a government end-user, as defined in part 772, and he or she  understands the cryptographic software is subject to export controls  under the Export Administration Regulations and anyone receiving the  transfer cannot export the software without a license or other  authorization. BIS will consider acknowledgments in electronic form  provided they are adequate to assure legal undertakings similar to  written acknowledgments.
