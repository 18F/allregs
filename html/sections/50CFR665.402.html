The  CNMI Management Subarea is further divided into subareas with the  following designations and boundaries:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CNMI Inshore Area means that portion of the EEZ within 3  nautical miles from the shoreline of the CNMI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CNMI Offshore Area means that portion of the EEZ seaward of 3  nautical miles from the shoreline of the CNMI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The outer boundary of each fishery management area is a line  drawn in such a manner that each point on it is   200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea is  measured, or is coterminous with adjacent international maritime  boundaries, except that the outer boundary of the CNMI Inshore Area is 3  nautical miles from the shoreline. The boundary between the fishery  management areas of Guam and CNMI extends to those points which are  equidistant between Guam and the island of Rota in the CNMI. CNMI and  Guam management subareas are divided by a line intersecting these two  points: 148[deg] E. long., 12[deg] N. lat., and 142[deg] E. long.,  16[deg] N. lat.</p>
