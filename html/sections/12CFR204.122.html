                                Sec. 204.122  Secondary market activities of international banking
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Questions have been raised concerning the extent to which  international banking facilities may purchase (or sell) IBF-eligible  assets such as loans (including loan participations), securities, CDs,  and bankers' acceptances from (or to) third parties. Under the Board's  regulations, as specified in Sec. 204.8 of Regulation D, IBFs are  limited, with respect to making loans and accepting deposits, to dealing  only with certain customers, such as other IBFs and foreign offices of  other organizations, and with the entity establishing the IBF. In  addition, an IBF may extend credit to a nonbank customer only to finance  the borrower's non-U.S. operations and may accept deposits from a  nonbank customer that are used only to support the depositor's non-U.S.  business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with the Board's intent, IBFs may purchase IBF- eligible assets \1\ from, or sell such assets to, any domestic or  foreign customer provided that the transactions are at arm's length  without recourse. However, an IBF of a U.S. depository institution may  not purchase assets from, or sell such assets to, any U.S. affiliate of  the institution establishing the IBF; an IBF of an Edge or Agreement  corporation may not purchase assets from, or sell assets to, any U.S.  affiliate of the Edge or Agreement corporation or to U.S. branches of  the Edge or Agreement corporation or to U.S. branches of the Edge or  Agreement corporation other than the branch \2\ establishing the IBF;  and an IBF of a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank may not purchase  assets from, or sell assets to any U.S. affiliates of the foreign bank  or to any other U.S. branch or agency of the same foreign bank. \2\  (This would not prevent an IBF from purchasing (or selling) assets  directly from (or to) any IBF, including an IBF of an affiliate, or to  the institution establishing the IBF; such purchases from the  institution establishing the IBF would continue to be subject to  Eurocurrency reserve requirements except during the initial four-week  transition period.) Since repurchase agreements are regarded as loans,  transactions involving repurchase agreements are permitted only with  customers who are otherwise eligible to deal with IBFs, as specified in  Regulation D. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ In order for an asset to be eligible to be held by an IBF, the  obligor or issuer of the instrument, or in the case of bankers'  acceptances, the customer and any endorser or acceptor, must be an IBF- eligible customer.</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Branches of Edge or Agreement corporations and agencies and  branches of foreign banks that file a consolidated report for reserve  requirements purposes (FR 2900) are considered to be the establishing  entity of an IBF. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of purchases of assets, in order to determine that  the Board's use-of-proceeds requirement has been met, it is necessary  for the IBF (1) to ascertain that the applicable IBF notices and  acknowledgments have been provided, or (2) in the case of loans or  securities, to review the documentation underlying the loan or security,  or accompanying the security (e.g., the prospectus or offering  statement), to determine that the proceeds are being used only to  finance the obligor's operations outside the U.S., or (3) in the case of  loans, to obtain a statement from either the seller or borrower that the  proceeds are being used only to finance operations outside the U.S., or  in the case of securities, to obtain such a statement from the obligor,  or (4) in the case of bankers' acceptances, to review the underlying  documentation to determine that the proceeds are being used only to  finance the parties' operations outside the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Under the Board's regulations, IBFs are not permitted to issue  negotiable Euro-CDs, bankers' acceptances, or similar instruments.  Accordingly, consistent with the Board's intent in this area, IBFs may  sell such instruments issued by third parties that qualify as IBF- eligible assets provided that the IBF, its establishing institution and  any affiliate of the institution   establishing the IBF do not endorse, accept, or otherwise guarantee the  instrument.
