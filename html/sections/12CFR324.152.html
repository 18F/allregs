                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Under the SRWA, an FDIC-supervised institution's  aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal  to the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the FDIC- supervised institution's individual equity exposures (other than equity  exposures to an investment fund) as determined in this section and the  risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the FDIC-supervised  institution's individual equity exposures to an investment fund as  determined in Sec. 324.154.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> SRWA computation for individual equity exposures. An FDIC- supervised institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for  an individual equity exposure (other than an equity exposure to an  investment fund) by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the  equity exposure or the effective portion and ineffective portion of a  hedge pair (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) by the lowest  applicable risk weight in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Zero percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure to  an entity whose credit exposures are exempt from the 0.03 percent PD  floor in Sec. 324.131(d)(2) is assigned a zero percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 20 percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure to a  Federal Home Loan Bank or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation  (Farmer Mac) is assigned a 20 percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 100 percent risk weight equity exposures. The following equity  exposures are assigned a 100 percent risk weight:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Community development equity exposures. An equity exposure that  qualifies as a community development investment under section 24  (Eleventh) of the National Bank Act, excluding equity exposures to an  unconsolidated small   business investment company and equity exposures held through a  consolidated small business investment company described in section 302  of the Small Business Investment Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effective portion of hedge pairs. The effective portion of a  hedge pair.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Non-significant equity exposures. Equity exposures, excluding  significant investments in the capital of an unconsolidated institution  in the form of common stock and exposures to an investment firm that  would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were it not  for the FDIC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in  Sec. 324.2 and has greater than immaterial leverage, to the extent that  the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the exposures does not exceed  10 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of an FDIC- supervised institution's equity exposures for purposes of this section,  the FDIC-supervised institution may exclude equity exposures described  in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section,  the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying  value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund  equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are  not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i)  of this section. If an FDIC-supervised institution does not know the  actual holdings of the investment fund, the FDIC-supervised institution  may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not  equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership  agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible  investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure  classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the FDIC-supervised  institution must assume for purposes of this section that the investment  fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When determining which of an FDIC-supervised institution's  equity exposures qualifies for a 100 percent risk weight under this  section, an FDIC-supervised institution first must include equity  exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held  through consolidated small business investment companies described in  section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include  publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly  through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded  equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment  funds).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> are assigned a 250 percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 300 percent risk weight equity exposures. A publicly traded  equity exposure (other than an equity exposure described in paragraph  (b)(6) of this section and including the ineffective portion of a hedge  pair) is assigned a 300 percent risk weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> of this  section) that is not publicly traded is assigned a 400 percent risk  weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 600 percent risk weight equity exposures. An equity exposure to  an investment firm that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would meet the definition of a traditional securitization were  it not for the FDIC's application of paragraph (8) of that definition in  Sec. 324.2; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has greater than immaterial leverage is assigned a 600 percent  risk weight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hedge transactions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hedge pair. A hedge pair is two equity  exposures that form an effective hedge so long as each equity exposure  is publicly traded or has a return that is primarily based on a publicly  traded equity exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective hedge. Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if  the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a  remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is  formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the FDIC- supervised institution acquires at least one of the equity exposures);  the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E)   the FDIC-supervised institution will use for the hedge relationship  throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has  an E greater than or equal to 0.8. An FDIC-supervised institution must  measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative  measures of E:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the  FDIC-supervised institution must determine the ratio of value change  (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic  changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of the  periodic changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is  positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals zero. If RVC is  negative and greater than or equal to -1 (that is, between zero and -1),  then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less  than -1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Under the variability-reduction method of measuring  effectiveness: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10SE13.045</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Under the regression method of measuring effectiveness, E  equals the coefficient of determination of a regression in which the  change in value of one exposure in a hedge pair is the dependent  variable and the change in value of the other exposure in a hedge pair  is the independent variable. However, if the estimated regression  coefficient is positive, then the value of E is zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The effective portion of a hedge pair is E multiplied by the  greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures forming  a hedge pair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The ineffective portion of a hedge pair is (1-E) multiplied by  the greater of the adjusted carrying values of the equity exposures  forming a hedge pair.</p>
