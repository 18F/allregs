                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If no subjects are entered into clinical studies for a period of 2 years or more under an IND, or if all investigations under an IND remain on clinical hold for 1 year or more, the IND may be placed by FDA on inactive status. This action may be taken by FDA either on request of the sponsor or on FDA's own initiative. If FDA seeks to act on its own initiative under this section, it shall first notify the sponsor in writing of the proposed inactive status. Upon receipt of such notification, the sponsor shall have 30 days to respond as to why the IND should continue to remain active.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an IND is placed on inactive status, all investigators shall be so notified and all stocks of the drug shall be returned or otherwise disposed of in accordance with Sec.  312.59.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A sponsor is not required to submit annual reports to an IND on inactive status. An inactive IND is, however, still in effect for purposes of the public disclosure of data and information under Sec.  312.130.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A sponsor who intends to resume clinical investigation under an IND placed on inactive status shall submit a protocol amendment under Sec.  312.30 containing the proposed general investigational plan for the coming year and appropriate protocols. If the protocol

amendment relies on information previously submitted, the plan shall reference such information. Additional information supporting the proposed investigation, if any, shall be submitted in an information amendment. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec.  312.30, clinical investigations under an IND on inactive status may only resume (1) 30 days after FDA receives the protocol amendment, unless FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations described in the amendment are subject to a clinical hold under Sec.  312.42, or (2) on earlier notification by FDA that the clinical investigations described in the protocol amendment may begin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An IND that remains on inactive status for 5 years or more may be terminated under Sec.  312.44.
