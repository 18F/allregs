The project must require the waiver of a provision of law, rule, or regulation which is eligible for waiver under the demonstration authority contained in 5 U.S.C. 4703. A project which can be undertaken under an agency's own authority and does not require the waiver of a provision of law, rule, or regulation is not considered a ``demonstration project'' for purposes of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Research means systematic, intensive study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. Activities classified as research are structured experimental or descriptive investigations conducted according to sound methodological principles.</p><p class="depth0">Research Program means a planned study of the manner in which public management policies and systems are operating or have operated, the effects of those policies and systems, the possibilities for change, and comparisons among policies and systems.</p>
