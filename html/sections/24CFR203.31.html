may prescribe), to meet the occupancy requirement upon his or her discharge from the service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A serviceperson will also be considered to meet the occupancy requirement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section for mortgage insurance purposes, if the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The serviceperson and his or her family expect to meet the occupancy requirement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section for two or more years. The Commissioner may shorten this period to one year, if (i) the serviceperson's family will occupy the property for at least one year and (ii) the serviceperson is assigned to a combat zone or other hazardous duty area where the family cannot accompany him or her; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The property is located in an area in which the prospects of resale are reasonable.
