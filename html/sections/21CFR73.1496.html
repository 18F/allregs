                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive mica is a white powder obtained  from the naturally occurring mineral, muscovite mica, consisting  predominantly of a potassium aluminum silicate,  K2Al4(Al2Si6O20)(O H)4 or, alternatively, H2KAl3  (SiO4)3. Mica may be identified and  semiquantitatively determined by its characteristic X-ray diffraction  pattern and by its optical properties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Color additive mixtures for drug use made with mica may contain  only those diluents listed in this subpart as safe and suitable for use  in color additive mixtures for coloring drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. Mica shall conform to the following  specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named  to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by good  manufacturing practice:  Fineness, 100 percent shall pass through a 100-mesh sieve. Loss on ignition at 600-650 [deg]C, not more than 2 percent. Lead (as Pb), not more than 20 parts per million. Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million. Mercury (as Hg), not more than 1 part per million.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. Mica may be safely used in amounts  consistent with good manufacturing practice to color dentifrices and  externally applied drugs, including those for use in the area of the  eye.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling requirements. The label of the color additive and of  any mixture prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring  purposes shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exemption from certification. Certification of this color  additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and  therefore batches therof are exempt from the certification requirements  of section 721(c) of the act.  [42 FR 38561, July 29, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 29665, Aug. 11, 1987]</p>
