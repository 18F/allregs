The right to hearing shall be restricted to matters in issue. At  such hearing, he shall have the right to be present in person or by  counsel and to submit evidence and argument in his behalf. Failure to  request a hearing within the specified time or failure to appear at the  hearing when scheduled shall be deemed a waiver of the right to hearing.  Such person may, in lieu of requesting an oral hearing, file a sworn  written statement with the Secretary not later than 10 days after  service of such notice upon him.</p>
