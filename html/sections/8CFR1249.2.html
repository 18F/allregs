                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Jurisdiction. An application by an alien, other than an arriving  alien, who has been served with a notice to appear or warrant of arrest  shall be considered only in proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240. In any  other case, an alien who believes he or she meets the eligibility  requirements of section 249 of the Act shall apply to the district  director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. The  application shall be made on Form I-485 and shall be accompanied by Form  G-325A, which shall be considered part of the application. The  application shall also be accompanied by documentary evidence  establishing continuous residence in the United States since prior to  January 1, 1972, or since entry and prior to July 1, 1924. All documents  must be submitted in accordance with Sec. 103.2(b) of this chapter.  Documentary evidence may include any records of official or personal  transactions or recordings of events occurring during the period of  claimed residence. Affidavits of credible witnesses may also be  accepted. Persons unemployed and unable to furnish evidence in their own  names may furnish evidence in the names of parents or other persons with  whom they have been living, if affidavits of the parents or other  persons are submitted attesting to the residence. The numerical  limitations of sections 201 and 202 of the Act shall not apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and,  if the application is denied, of the reasons therefor. If the  application is granted, a Form I-551, showing that the applicant has  acquired the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent  residence, shall not be issued until the applicant surrenders any other  document in his or her possession evidencing compliance with the alien  registration requirements of former or existing law. No appeal shall lie  from the denial of an application by the district director. However, an  alien, other than an arriving alien, may renew the denied application in  proceedings under 8 CFR part 1240.
