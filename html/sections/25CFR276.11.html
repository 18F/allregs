                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Grantees may follow their own property management policies and procedures if they observe the requirements of this section. With respect to property covered by this section, the Bureau may not impose on grantees any requirements (including property reporting requirements)--not authorized by this part unless specifically required by Federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Title to real property to be acquired in whole or in part from a Bureau grant under part 900 of this chapter shall vest in one of the following manners:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Title may be taken by the United States in trust for the Indian tribe upon the request of the tribe and when the real property to be acquired is within the reservation boundaries or adjoins on at least two sides other trust or restricted lands as prescribed in part 900 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fee title to the acquired real property shall vest in the Indian tribe whenever the acquisition does not meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless for other reasons a tribe requests title to be taken in the name of the United States. In the absence of applicable statutory authority governing the disposition of real property acquired by a tribe, the tribe shall use the real property for the authorized purposes and in accordance with any other requirements imposed by the terms and conditions of the original grant. Changes in use compatible to other tribal programs may be authorized by the Bureau. When no longer needed for the authorized purposes, the real property shall be used in accordance with the standards set forth in Sec. 276.11(d)(1) for non-expendable personal property. Accordingly, the following priority order for use of such property shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Other grants from the Bureau.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grants from other Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tribal purposes consistent with those authorized for support by Bureau grants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Tribal official activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In those instances where the Indian tribe requests, title may be acquired by the United States. Use of these acquired real property interests will be subject to the authorized purposes and in accordance with the provisions of the original grant. Upon a determination that the real property is no longer needed for the authorized purposes, disposition may be made by

declaring it excess under provisions of the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954) and title transferred to the Secretary to be held by the United States in trust for the tribe. Where real property does not meet the requirements under the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954), the tribe may elect to acquire title under applicable enabling statutory authorities, or in the absence of statutory authority, request withholding disposition in aid of legislation, or authorize disposal under the General Services Administration procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section shall also apply when real property is acquired in whole or in part by a Bureau grant other than that provided under part 900 of this chapter. However, when such property is acquired by a grantee other than an Indian tribe, or a tribal governing body, fee simple title to the property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. In the absence of applicable statutory provisions governing the use or disposition of such property, it shall be subject to the following requirments, in addition to any other requirements imposed by the terms and conditions of the grant:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The grantee shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the original grant as long as needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grantee shall obtain approval by the Bureau for the use of the real property in other projects when the grantee determines that the property is no longer needed for the original grant purposes. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under other Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the grantor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the grantee shall return all real property furnished or purchased wholly with Bureau grant funds to the control of the Bureau. In the case of property purchased in part with Bureau grant funds, the grantee may be permitted to take title to the Federal interest therein upon compensating the Federal Government for its fair share of the property. The Federal share of the property shall be the amount computed by applying the percentage of the Federal participation in the total cost of the grant program for which the property was acquired to the current fair market value of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Standards and procedures governing ownership, use, and disposition of nonexpendable personal property furnished by the Bureau or acquired with Bureau funds are set forth below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Nonexpendable personal property acquired with Bureau funds. When nonexpendable personal property is acquired by a grantee wholly or in part with Bureau funds, title will not be taken by the Bureau except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section but shall be vested in the grantee subject to the following restrictions on use and disposition of the property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The grantee shall retain the property acquired with Bureau funds in the grant program as long as there is a need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the grant program whether or not the program continues to be supported by Bureau funds. When there is no longer a need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the grant program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with the other Federal grants it has received in the following order of priority:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Other grants from the Bureau needing the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Grants of other Federal agencies needing the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When the grantee no longer has need for the property in any of its Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the grantor, the property may be used for its own official activities in accordance with the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of less than $500 and used four years or more. The grantee may use the property for its own official activities without reimbursement to the Federal government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All other nonexpendable property. The grantee may retain the property for its own use if a fair compensation is made to the Bureau for the latter's share of the property. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of

Bureau participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the grantee has no need for the property, disposition of the property shall be made as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or less. Except for that property which meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau an amount which is computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of over $1,000. The grantee shall request disposition instructions from the Bureau. The Bureau shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the Bureau's requirement. If no requirement exists within the Bureau, the availability of the property shall be reported to the General Services Administration (GSA) by the Bureau to determine whether a requirement for the property exists in other Federal agencies. The Bureau shall issue instructions to the grantee within 120 days and the following procedures shall govern:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee's participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the grantee is instructed to otherwise dispose of the property, he shall be reimbursed by the Bureau of such costs incurred in its disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If disposition instructions are not issued within 120 days after reporting, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau and amount which is computed by applying the percentage of Bureau participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. Further, the grantee shall be permitted to retain $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Where the Bureau determines that property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more and financed solely with Bureau funds is unique, different, or costly to replace, it may reserve title to such property, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant agreement or otherwise made known to the grantee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Bureau shall issue disposition instructions within 120 days after the completion of the need for the property under the grant for which it was acquired. If the Bureau fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 days, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)(B), and (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federally owned nonexpendable personal property. Unless statutory authority to transfer title has been granted to an agency, title to Federally owned property (property to which the Federal Government retains title including excess property made available by the Bureau to grantees) remains vested by law in the Federal Government. Upon termination of the grant or need for the property, such property shall be reported to the Bureau for further Bureau use or, if appropriate, for reporting to the General Services Administration for other Federal agency use. Appropriate disposition instructions will be issued to the grantee after completion of Bureau review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable personal property shall also include the following procedural requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property records shall be maintained accurately and provide for a description of the property; manufacturer's serial number or other identification number; acquisition date and cost; source of the property; percentage of Federal funds used in the purchase of property; location, use, and condition of the property; and ultimate disposition data including sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value if the grantee reimburses the bureau for its share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years to verify the

existence, current use, and continued need for the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft to the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Proper sales procedures shall be established for unneeded property which would provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> When the total inventory value of any unused expendable personal property exceeds $500 at the expiration of need for any grant purposes, the grantee may retain the property or sell the property as long as he compensates the Bureau for its share in the cost. The amount of compensation shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Specific standards for control of intangible property are provided as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If any program produces patentable items, patent rights, processes, or inventions, in the course of work aided by a Bureau grant, such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Bureau. Unless there is prior agreement between the grantee and Bureau on disposition of such items, the Bureau shall determine whether protection on such invention or discovery shall be sought and how the rights in the invention or discovery--including rights under any patent issued on it--shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public interest consistent with ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's memorandum for heads of executive departments and agencies), dated August 23, 1971, and Statement of Government Patent Policy as printed in 36 FR 16889.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the grant results in a book or other copyrightable material, the author or grantee is eligible to copyright the work if it is found that (i) the retention of the copyright is not precluded by statute and (ii) equity or the public interest is best served by doing so, by reason of special circumstances. If it is found that the public interest is best served by limiting the term of any copyright to be obtained, such limits shall be set forth in the grant agreement. ``Developmental'' copyrights may be requested during the development, testing, or evaluation of copyrightable materials in order to prevent them from prematurely falling into the public domain. The copyright will be in accordance with copyright laws. However, the Government shall receive a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use the work for Government purposes. A copy of any copyright obtained by a grantee shall be provided to the Bureau. Program income received as royalties from copyrights on materials produced under grants is retained by the grantee during the grant period and is to be used according to the provisions of Sec. 276.6(c). Specific agreements between the Bureau and the grantee shall be entered into before the grant is awarded to determine the uses of the royalty income after the grant is completed or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The use of Bureau-owned facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner by a grantee for purposes of carrying out a grant may be authorized when the facilities are not needed for Bureau purposes.
