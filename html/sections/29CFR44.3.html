                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Process. The Commissioner of Labor Statistics of the U.S.  Department of Labor (hereafter referred to as ``the Commissioner'') or  his or her designee shall conduct the elections. The Commissioner shall  provide a ballot containing the names of the employment statistics  directors in the appropriate region to the employment statistics  director in each State who is affiliated with the State agency  designated pursuant to section 15(e) of the Wagner-Peyser Act. If a  State has not designated an agency, or has not provided the name of the  employment statistics director to the Commissioner, the State shall not  participate in the election process. Each director may vote for one  director to be the regional representative. The Commissioner shall  prescribe a time limit that will not be less than one week for the  directors to mark and return the ballots. Only votes received by the  Commissioner within the prescribed time limit will be counted. The  Commissioner will tally the votes from the ballots received within the  prescribed time limit and the director receiving the most votes in the  region will be the representative for that region. If there is a tie  after the first round of votes are counted, the Commissioner shall  conduct additional rounds of voting using a ballot containing the names  of the directors who tied with the most votes in the previous round  until a representative is elected. The Commissioner will prescribe a  time limit of not less than one week for each additional round of voting  and will tally the votes received within the prescribed time limit. The   director with the most votes will be the representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of transmission. The Commissioner may distribute the  ballots relating to the election under this part by electronic mail or  other methods the Commissioner determines to be appropriate and may  specify the methods through which votes are to be cast.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vacancies. If a representative does not complete the term, the  Commissioner shall conduct an election to elect a replacement for the  remainder of the term using the procedures described in paragraph (a)  and (b) of this section.</p>
