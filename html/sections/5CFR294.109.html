                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OPM will furnish, without charge,  reasonable quantities of material that it has available for free  distribution to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OPM may furnish other materials, subject to payment of fees  intended to recoup the full allowable direct costs of providing  services. Fees for these materials may be waived if the request meets  the requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a request does not include an acceptable agreement to pay  fees and does not otherwise convey a willingness to pay fees, OPM will  promptly provide notification of the estimated fees. This notice will  offer an opportunity to confer with OPM staff to reformulate the request  to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. Upon agreement to pay the  required fees, OPM will further process the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As described in Sec. 294.107, OPM ordinarily responds to FOIA  requests in a decentralized manner. Because of this, OPM may at times  refer a single request to two or more OPM entities to make separate  direct responses. In such cases, each responding entity may assess fees  as provided by this section, but only for direct costs associated with  any response it has prepared.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If fees for document search are authorized as provided in  paragraph (c) of this section, OPM may assess charges for employee time  spent searching for documents and other direct costs of a search, even  if a search fails to locate records or if records located are determined  to be exempt from disclosure. Searches should be conducted in the most  efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize the cost for both  the agency and the requester, e.g., personnel should not engage in line- by-line search when photocopying an entire document would be a less  expensive and quicker way to comply with a request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Services requested and performed but not required under the  FOIA, such as formal certification of records as true copies, will be  subject to charges under the Federal User Charge Statute (31 U.S.C.  483a) or other applicable statutes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rates used to compute fees. The following rates form the basis  for assessing reasonable, standard charges for document search,  duplication, and review as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). The listing  of rates below should be used in conjunction with the fee components  listed in paragraph (c) of this section:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Service                               Rate ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Employee time.............................  Salary rate plus 16% to</p><p class="depth2">cover benefits. Photocopies (up to 8\1/2\x14). Printed materials, per 25 pages or          $.025.</p><p class="depth2">fraction thereof. Computer time.............................  Actual direct cost. Supplies and other materials..............  Actual direct cost. Other costs not identified above..........  Actual direct cost. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assessing fees based on requester's category. Rates are assessed  differently for the different categories of requesters as defined in  Sec. 294.103. Requests have three cost components for the purpose of  assessing fees: the cost of document search, the cost of duplication,  and the cost of review. OPM will apply the rates in paragraph (b) of  this section to the cost components that apply to the requester's  category as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Requester's category                   Search                   Review                Duplication ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial...........................  Actual direct costs....  Actual direct costs....  Actual direct costs. Non-commercial (educational or         No charge..............  No charge..............  Actual direct costs.\1\</p><p class="depth2">scientific institution) or news</p><p class="depth2">media. All others...........................  Actual direct costs \2\  No charge..............  Actual direct costs.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ First 100 pages of paper copies or reasonable equivalent, such as a microfiche containing the equivalent of</p><p class="depth2">100 pages, are copied free. \2\ First 2 hours of manual search time are free. If requested records are maintained in a computerized data</p><p class="depth2">base, OPM will use the following formula, suggested by OMB, to provide the equivalent of 2 hours manual search</p><p class="depth2">time free before charging for computer search time: The operator's hourly salary plus 16% will be added to the</p><p class="depth2">hourly cost of operating the central processing unit that contains the record information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Payment of fees. Fees are payable by check or money order to the  Office of Personnel Management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than  $25, no fee will be assessed (except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of  this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a request may reasonably result in a fee assessment of more  than $25, OPM will not release the records unless the requester agrees  in advance to pay the anticipated charges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OPM may aggregate requests and charge fees accordingly, when  there is a reasonable belief that a requester, or a group of requesters  acting in concert, is attempting to break down a request into a series  of requests to evade the assessment of fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If multiple requests of this type occur within a 30-day period,  OPM may provide notice that it is aggregating the requests and that it  will apply the fee provisions of this section, including any required  agreement to pay fees and any advance payment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Before aggregating requests of this type made over a period  longer than 30 days, OPM will assure that it has a solid basis on which  to conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting  specifically to avoid payment of fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> OPM will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects  from one person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payment of fees in advance. If OPM estimates or determines that  fees are likely to exceed $250, OPM may require the payment of  applicable fees in advance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an OPM official, who is authorized to make a decision on a  particular request, determines that the requester has a history of  prompt payment of FOIA fees, OPM will provide notice of the likely cost  and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a person, or an organization that a person represents, has  previously failed to pay assessed fees in a timely manner (i.e., payment  was not made within 30 days of the billing date), OPM will require full  payment of all fees in advance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a person, or an organization that a person represents, has  not paid fees previously assessed, OPM will not begin to process any new  request for records until the requester has paid the full amount owed  plus any applicable interest, and made a full advance payment for the  new request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. OPM will furnish documents without  any charge, or at a reduced charge, if disclosure of the information is  in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly  to public understanding of the operations or activities of the  Government, and release of the material is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest  because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding  of the operations or activities of the Government, OPM shall consider  the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns ``the operations or activities of the Government'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The information value of the information to be disclosed:  Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding  of Government operations or activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the  general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of  the requested information will contribute to ``public understanding'';  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution to public understanding:  Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to  public understanding of Government operations or activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether disclosure of the information is or is  not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, OPM shall  consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest. Whether  the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the  requested disclosure; and, if so--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The primary interest in disclosure. Whether the magnitude of  the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently  large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that  disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In all cases the burden of proof shall be on the requester to  present evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver or  reduction of fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Denial of waiver request. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An OPM official may deny a request  for a full or partial waiver of fees without further consideration if  the request does not include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A clear statement of the requester's interest in the requested  information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A clear statement of the use proposed for the information and  whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A clear statement of how the public will benefit from OPM's  release of the requested information; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If specialized use of the documents is contemplated, a clear  statement of the requester's qualifications that are relevant to the  specialized use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A requester may appeal the denial of a waiver request as  provided by Sec. 294.110 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fees not paid; penalties; debt collection. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a request,  which requires the advance payment of fees under the criteria specified  in this section, is not accompanied by the required payment, OPM will  promptly notify the requester that the required fee must be paid within  30 days, and that OPM will not further process the request until it  receives payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OPM may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill  starting on the 31st day following the date on which the bill was sent.  Interest will be charged at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717, and  will accrue from the date of the billing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To encourage the repayment of debts incurred under this subpart,  OPM may use the procedures authorized by Public Law 97-365, the Debt  Collection Act of 1982. This may include disclosure to consumer  reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies.  [58 FR 32044, June 8, 1993]</p>
