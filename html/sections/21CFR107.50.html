The regulations in this subpart  establish the terms and conditions that a manufacturer must meet with  respect to such infant formulas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Infant formulas generally available at the retail level. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  These exempt infant formulas can generally be purchased from retail  store shelves that are readily available to the public. Such formulas  are also typically represented and labeled for use to provide dietary  management for diseases or conditions that are not clinically serious or  life-threatening, even though such formulas may also be represented and  labeled for use in clinically serious or life-threatening disorders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the  act, the quality control procedure requirements of part 106, and the  labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this  paragraph, the manufacturer shall submit to the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA), at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of  this section, on or before May 21, 1986, or on or before the 90th day  before the first processing of the infant formula for commercial or  charitable distribution, whichever occurs later, the label and other  labeling of the infant formula, a complete quantitative formulation for  the infant formula, and a detailed description of the medical conditions  for which the infant formula is represented. FDA will review the  information under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this  paragraph, when any change in ingredients or processes that may result  in an adverse impact on levels of nutrients or availability of nutrients  is instituted, the manufacturer shall submit to FDA at the address  specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, before the first  processing of the infant formula, the label and other labeling of the  infant formula, a complete quantitative formulation for the infant  formula, a detailed description of the reformulation and the rationale  for the reformulation, a complete description of the change in  processing, and a detailed description of the medical conditions for  which the infant formula is represented. FDA will review that  information under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A manufacturer may deviate from the requirements of paragraph  (b)(2) of this section only with respect to those specific requirements  for which it submits to FDA, at the address specified in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section, the medical, nutritional, scientific, or  technological rationale (including any appropriate animal or human  clinical studies). FDA will review that information under paragraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Infant formulas not generally available at the retail level. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  These exempt infant formulas are not generally found on retail shelves  for general consumer purchase. Such formulas typically are prescribed by  a physician, and must be requested from a pharmacist or are distributed  directly to institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and State or  Federal agencies. Such formulas are also generally represented and  labeled solely to provide dietary management for specific diseases or  conditions that are clinically serious or life-threatening and generally  are required for prolonged periods of time. Exempt infant formulas  distributed directly to institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and  State or Federal agencies that are of the same formulation as those  generally available at the retail level are subject to the requirements  of paragraph (b) of this section rather than to the requirements of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  of the act, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each manufacturer of an infant formula covered by this paragraph  shall establish quality control procedures designed to ensure that the  infant formula meets applicable nutrient requirements of this section,  including any special nutritional characteristics for the specific  disorders or conditions for which the formula is represented for use.  Each manufacturer shall maintain records of such quality control  procedures sufficient to permit a public health evaluation of each  manufactured batch of infant formula and shall permit any authorized FDA  employee at all reasonable times to have access to and to copy and  verify the records referred to in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A manufacturer may deviate from the requirements of paragraph  (c)(2) of this section only with respect to those specific requirements  for which it submits to FDA, at the address specified in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section, the medical, nutritional, scientific, or  technological rationale (including any appropriate animal or human  clinical studies). FDA will review that information under paragaraph (d)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The requirements of this section do not apply to an infant  formula specially and individually prepared for one or more specific  infants on a physician's request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> FDA review of exempt status. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FDA's Center for Food Safety  and Applied Nutrition will review information submitted by infant  formula manufacturers under paragraph (b) (3), (b) (4), or (c)(4) of  this section. On the basis of such review and other information  available to the agency, the Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition may impose additional conditions on, or modify requirements  for, the quality control procedures, nutrient specifications, or  labeling of an infant formula, or withdraw a product's exempt status.  Such determinations will be made by the Director of the Center for Food  Safety and Applied Nutrition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If after completing its review of all information submitted,  the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition concludes that  additional or modified quality control, nutrient, or labeling  requirements are needed, or that a product's exempt status is withdrawn,  the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition will so notify the  manufacturer and this notification will specify the reasons therefor.  Upon receipt of this notification, the manufacturer has 10 working days  to have the decision reviewed under Sec. 10.75 by the office of the  Commissioner of Food and Drugs. A determination by the Director of the  Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition that is not appealed  becomes a final agency decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After a final decision by the Director or by the office of the  Commissioner that a product's exempt status is withdrawn, the  manufacturer shall comply with the nutrient requirements of section  412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2)  of the act, the quality control requirements of part 106, and the  labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The compliance date for the withdrawal of a product's exempt  status or the imposition of additional or modified quality control,  nutrient, or labeling requirements is 60 calendar days after issuance of  the final decision except as otherwise provided for reasons stated in  the decision. If the agency determines that a health hazard may exist  and so notifies the manufacturer, withdrawal of a product's exempt  status shall be effective on the date of receipt of notification from  the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  Additional or modified requirements, or the withdrawal of an exemption,  apply only to those formulas that are manufactured after the compliance  date. A postponement of the compliance date may be granted for good  cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> FDA may decide that withdrawal of an exemption is necessary  when, on the basis of its review under paragraph (d)(1) of this section,  it concludes that quality control procedures are not adequate to ensure  that the formula contains all required nutrients, that deviations in  nutrient levels are not supported by generally accepted scientific,  nutritional, or medical rationale, or that deviations from subpart B of  this part are not necessary to provide appropriate directions for  preparation and use of the infant formula, or that additional labeling  information is necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> FDA will use the following criteria in determining whether  deviations from the requirements of this subpart are necessary and will  adequately protect the public health:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A deviation from the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of  the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act  is necessary to provide an infant formula that is appropriate for the  dietary management of a specific disease, disorder, or medical  condition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For exempt infant formulas subject to paragraph (b) of this  section, a   deviation from the quality control procedures requirements of part 106  is necessary because of unusal or difficult technological problems in  manufacturing the infant formula; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A deviation from the labeling requirements of subpart B of  this part is necessary because label information, including pictograms  and symbols required by those regulations, could lead to inappropriate  use of the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information required by  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be submitted to the Food  and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,  Office of Nutrition, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, Infant Formula  and Medical Foods Staff (HFS-850), Food and Drug Administration, 5100  Paint Branch Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) that  reasonably supports the conclusion that an exempt infant formula that  has been processed by the manufacturer and that has left an  establishment subject to the control of the manufacturer may not provide  the nutrients required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or when  there is an exempt infant formula that may be otherwise adulterated or  misbranded and if so adulterated or misbranded presents a risk of human  health. This notification shall be made, by telephone, to the Director  of the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office  specified in part 5, subpart M of this chapter. After normal business  hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), contact the Food and Drug Administration  Emergency Call Center at 866-300-4374. The manufacturer shall send a  followup written confirmation to the Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition (HFS-605), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch  Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, and to the appropriate FDA district  office specified in part 5, subpart M of this chapter.
