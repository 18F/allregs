                            <p class="depth0">In order to participate in the Program, a producer of advanced biofuels must be approved by the Agency and enter into a contract with the Agency. The process for enrolling in the Program is presented in this section. Advanced biofuel producers who expect to produce eligible advanced biofuels at any time during a fiscal year must enroll in the Program as described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Enrollment. To enroll in the Program, an advanced biofuel producer must submit to the Agency a completed enrollment application during the applicable sign-up period, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. An original, signed hard copy of the enrollment application must be submitted as specified in the annual Federal Register notice for this program. All applicants, except those that are individuals, are required to have a Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which can be obtained online at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligible advanced biofuel producers must submit enrollment applications during each sign-up period in order to continue participating in this Program. If a participating producer fails to submit the enrollment application during a fiscal year's applicable sign-up period, the producer's contract will be terminated and the producer will be ineligible to receive payments for that fiscal year. Such a producer must reapply, and sign a new contract, to participate in the Program for future fiscal years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligible advanced biofuel producers may submit an enrollment application during a fiscal year's sign-up period even if the advanced biofuel facility is not currently producing, but is scheduled to start producing advanced biofuel in that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The producer must furnish the Agency all required certifications before acceptance into the Program, and furnish access to the advanced biofuel producer's records required by the Agency to verify compliance with Program provisions. The required certifications depend on the type of biofuel produced. Certifications specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iv) of this section are to be completed and provided by an accredited independent third party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Alcohol. For alcohol producers with authority from ATF to produce alcohol, copies of either</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Alcohol Fuel Producers Permit (TTB F 5110.74) or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The registration of Distilled Spirits Plant (TTB F 5110.41) and Operating Permit (TTB F 5110.25).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hydrous ethanol. For hydrous ethanol that is upgraded by another distiller to anhydrous ethyl alcohol, the increased ethanol production is eligible for payment one time only. If the advanced biofuel producer entering into this agreement is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The hydrous ethanol producer, then the advanced biofuel producer shall include with the contract an affidavit, acceptable to the Agency, from the distiller stating that the:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable hydrous ethanol produced is distilled and denatured for fuel use according to ATF requirements, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Distiller will not include the applicable ethanol in any payment requests that the distiller may make under this Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The distiller that upgrades hydrous ethanol to anhydrous ethyl alcohol, then the advanced biofuel producer shall include with the contract an affidavit, acceptable to the Agency, from the hydrous ethanol producer stating that the hydrous ethanol producer will not include the applicable ethanol in any payment requests that may be made under this Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Biodiesel, biomass-based diesel, and liquid hydrocarbons derived from biomass. For these fuels, the advanced biofuel producer shall certify that the producer, the advanced biofuel facility, and the biofuel meet the definitions of these terms as defined in Sec. 4288.102, the applicable registration requirements under the Energy Independence and Security Act and the Clean Air Act and under the applicable regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Internal Revenue Service, and the quality requirements per applicable ASTM International standards (e.g., ASTM D6751) and commercially acceptable quality standards of the local market. If a Renewable Identification Number has been established, the advanced biofuel producer shall also provide documentation of the most recent Renewable Identification Number for a typical gallon of each type of advanced biofuel produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gaseous advanced biofuel. For gaseous advanced biofuel producers, certification that the biofuel meets commercially acceptable pipeline quality standards of the local market; that the flow meters used to determine the quantity of advanced biofuel produced are industry standard and properly calibrated by a third-party professional; and that the readings have been taken by a qualified individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Woody biomass feedstock. If the feedstock is from National Forest system land or public lands, documentation must be provided that it cannot be used as a higher value wood-based product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Supporting documentation. Each advanced biofuel producer participating in this program for the first time must submit documentation to support the actual production and capacity reported in the enrollment application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional forms. Applicants must submit the forms specified in this paragraph with the enrollment application when applying for participation under this subpart and as needed when re-enrolling in the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> RD Instruction 1940-Q, Exhibit A-1, ``Certification for Contracts, Grants and Loans.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Form RD 400-4, ``Assurance Agreement.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Sign-up period.
