                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Regulation for preventing significant deterioration of air quality. The Oklahoma plan, as submitted, does not apply to certain sources in the State. Therefore the provisions of Sec. 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby incorporated, and made part of the Oklahoma State implementation plan, and are applicable to the following major stationary sources or major modifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sources permitted by EPA prior to approval of the Oklahoma PSD program for which EPA retains enforcement authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sources proposing to locate on lands over which Oklahoma does not have jurisdiction under the Clean Air Act to issue PSD permits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The plan revisions submitted by the Governor of Oklahoma on August 22, 1989, as adopted on March 23, 1989, by the Oklahoma State Board of Health and effective June 11, 1989, amendments to OAPCR 1.4.4 ``Major Sources--Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Requirements for Attainment Areas'' is approved as meeting the requirements of Part C of the Clean Air Act for preventing significant deterioration of air quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in Oklahoma's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are ``subject to regulation'', as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not ``subject to regulation.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in Oklahoma's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are ``subject to regulation'', as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not ``subject to regulation.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (b)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The term tpy CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98--Global Warming Potentials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO2e.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using

the EPA-approved procedures in Oklahoma Air Pollution Control Regulation Title 252, Chapter 100, Subchapter 8, Part 7) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in the EPA-approved Oklahoma Air Pollution Control Regulation 252:100-8-31, definitions for ``net emissions increase'' and ``significant'' occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO2e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and ``significant'' is defined as 75,000 tpy CO2e instead of applying the value in 252:100-8-31 of the EPA-approved definition for ``significant'' of Oklahoma's Air Pollution Control Regulations.
