                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1,  2, and 3) must not transport or deliver for transport in commerce a dog  or cat unless the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construction of primary enclosures. The dog or cat must be  contained in a primary enclosure such as a compartment, transport cage,  carton, or crate. Primary enclosures used to transport dogs and cats  must be constructed so that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The primary enclosure is strong enough to contain the dogs and  cats securely and comfortably and to withstand the normal rigors of  transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interior of the primary enclosure has no sharp points or  edges and no protrusions that could injure the animal contained in it;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The dog or cat is at all times securely contained within the  enclosure and cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure in a  way that could result in injury to itself, to handlers, or to persons or  animals nearby;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The dog or cat can be easily and quickly removed from the  enclosure in an emergency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance,  adequate devices such as handles or handholds are provided on its  exterior, and enable the enclosure to be lifted without tilting it, and  ensure that anyone handling the enclosure will not come into physical  contact with the animal contained inside;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance,  it is clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with the words  ``Live Animals,'' in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with  arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the  primary enclosure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any material, treatment, paint, preservative, or other chemical  used in or on the enclosure is nontoxic to the animal and not harmful to  the health or well-being of the animal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Proper ventilation is provided to the animal in accordance with  paragraph (c) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The primary enclosure has a solid, leak-proof bottom or a  removable, leak-proof collection tray under a slatted or mesh floor that  prevents seepage of waste products, such as excreta and body fluids,  outside of the enclosure. If a slatted or mesh floor is used in the  enclosure, it must be designed and constructed so that the animal cannot  put any part of its body between the slats or through the holes in the  mesh. Unless the dogs and cats are on raised slatted floors or raised  floors made of mesh, the primary enclosure must contain enough  previously unused litter to   absorb and cover excreta. The litter must be of a suitably absorbent  material that is safe and nontoxic to the dogs and cats.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> of this subpart. If the dogs or cats are in transit for more  than 24 hours, the enclosures must be cleaned and any litter replaced,  or other methods, such as moving the animals to another enclosure, must  be utilized to prevent the soiling of the dogs or cats by body wastes.  If it becomes necessary to remove the dog or cat from the enclosure in  order to clean, or to move the dog or cat to another enclosure, this  procedure must be completed in a way that safeguards the dog or cat from  injury and prevents escape.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ventilation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless the primary enclosure is permanently  affixed to the conveyance, there must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ventilation openings located on two opposing walls of the  primary enclosure and the openings must be at least 16 percent of the  surface area of each such wall, and the total combined surface area of  the ventilation openings must be at least 14 percent of the total  combined surface area of all the walls of the primary enclosure; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ventilation openings on three walls of the primary enclosure,  and the openings on each of the two opposing walls must be at least 8  percent of the total surface area of the two walls, and the ventilation  openings on the third wall of the primary enclosure must be at least 50  percent of the total surface area of that wall, and the total combined  surface area of the ventilation openings must be at least 14 percent of  the total combined surface area of all the walls of the primary  enclosure; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ventilation openings located on all four walls of the primary  enclosure and the ventilation openings on each of the four walls must be  at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each such wall, and the  total combined surface area of the openings must be at least 14 percent  of total combined surface area of all the walls of the primary  enclosure; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At least one-third of the ventilation area must be located on  the upper half of the primary enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the primary enclosure is permanently affixed to the  conveyance, projecting rims or similar devices must be located on the  exterior of each enclosure wall having a ventilation opening, in order  to prevent obstruction of the openings. The projecting rims or similar  devices must be large enough to provide a minimum air circulation space  of 0.75 in. (1.9 cm) between the primary enclosure and anything the  enclosure is placed against.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a primary enclosure is permanently affixed to the primary  conveyance so that there is only a front ventilation opening for the  enclosure, the primary enclosure must be affixed to the primary  conveyance in such a way that the front ventilation opening cannot be  blocked, and the front ventilation opening must open directly to an  unobstructed aisle or passageway inside the conveyance. The ventilation  opening must be at least 90 percent of the total area of the front wall  of the enclosure, and must be covered with bars, wire mesh, or smooth  expanded metal having air spaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compatibility. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Live dogs or cats transported in the same  primary enclosure must be of the same species and be maintained in  compatible groups, except that dogs and cats that are private pets, are  of comparable size, and are compatible, may be transported in the same  primary enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Puppies or kittens 4 months of age or less may not be  transported in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs or cats other  than their dams.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dogs or cats that are overly aggressive or exhibit a vicious  disposition must be transported individually in a primary enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any female dog or cat in heat (estrus) may not be transported in  the same primary enclosure with any male dog or cat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Space and placement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary enclosures used to transport  live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal  contained in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about  normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural  position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Primary enclosures used to transport dogs and cats must be  positioned in the primary conveyance so as to provide protection from  the elements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transportation by air. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No more than one live dog or cat, 6  months of age or older, may be transported in the same primary enclosure  when shipped via air carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No more than one live puppy, 8 weeks to 6 months of age, and  weighing over 20 lbs (9 kg), may be transported in a primary enclosure  when shipped via air carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No more than two live puppies or kittens, 8 weeks to 6 months of  age, that are of comparable size, and weighing 20 lbs (9 kg) or less  each, may be transported in the same primary enclosure when shipped via  air carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Weaned live puppies or kittens less than 8 weeks of age and of  comparable size, or puppies or kittens that are less than 8 weeks of age  that are littermates and are accompanied by their dam, may be  transported in the same primary enclosure when shipped to research  facilities, including Federal research facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transportation by surface vehicle or privately owned aircraft.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No more than four live dogs or cats, 8 weeks of age or older, that  are of comparable size, may be transported in the same primary enclosure  when shipped by surface vehicle (including ground and water  transportation) or privately owned aircraft, and only if all other  requirements of this section are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Weaned live puppies or kittens less than 8 weeks of age and of  comparable size, or puppies or kittens that are less than 8 weeks of age  that are littermates and are accompanied by their dam, may be  transported in the same primary enclosure when shipped to research  facilities, including Federal research facilities, and only if all other  requirements in this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Accompanying documents and records. Shipping documents that must  accompany shipments of dogs and cats may be held by the operator of the  primary conveyance, for surface transportation only, or must be securely  attached in a readily accessible manner to the outside of any primary  enclosure that is part of the shipment, in a manner that allows them to  be detached for examination and securely reattached, such as in a pocket  or sleeve. Instructions for administration of drugs, medication, and  other special care must be attached to each primary enclosure in a  manner that makes them easy to notice, to detach for examination, and to  reattach securely. Food and water instructions must be attached in  accordance with Sec. 3.13(c).  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0579-0093)  [56 FR 6486, Feb. 15, 1991, as amended at 63 FR 3023, Jan. 21, 1998]</p>
