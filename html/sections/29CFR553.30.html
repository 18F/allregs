                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 7(p)(2) of the FLSA provides that where State or local  government employees, solely at their option, work occasionally or  sporadically on a part-time basis for the same public agency in a  different capacity from their regular employment, the hours worked in  the different jobs shall not be combined for the purpose of determining  overtime liability under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Occasional or sporadic. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term occasional or sporadic  means infrequent, irregular, or occurring in scattered instances. There  may be an occasional need for additional resources in the delivery of  certain types of public services which is at times best met by the part- time employment of an individual who is already a public employee. Where  employees freely and solely at their own option enter into such  activity, the total hours worked will not be combined for purposes of  determining any overtime compensation due on the regular, primary job.  However, in order to prevent overtime abuse, such hours worked are to be  excluded from computing overtime compensation due only where the  occasional or sporadic assignments are not within the same general  occupational   category as the employee's regular work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the  employee's decision to work in a different capacity must be made freely  and without coercion, implicit or explicit, by the employer. An employer  may suggest that an employee undertake another kind of work for the same  unit of government when the need for assistance arises, but the employee  must be free to refuse to perform such work without sanction and without  being required to explain or justify the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Typically, public recreation and park facilities, and stadiums  or auditoriums utilize employees in occasional or sporadic work. Some of  these employment activities are the taking of tickets, providing  security for special events (e.g., concerts, sports events, and  lectures), officiating at youth or other recreation and sports events,  or engaging in food or beverage sales at special events, such as a  county fair. Employment in such activity may be considered occasional or  sporadic for regular employees of State or local government agencies  even where the need can be anticipated because it recurs seasonally  (e.g., a holiday concert at a city college, a program of scheduled  sports events, or assistance by a city payroll clerk in processing  returns at tax filing time). An activity does not fail to be occasional  merely because it is recurring. In contrast, for example, if a parks  department clerk, in addition to his or her regular job, also regularly  works additional hours on a part-time basis (e.g., every week or every  other week) at a public park food and beverage sales center operated by  that agency, the additional work does not constitute intermittent and  irregular employment and, therefore, the hours worked would be combined  in computing any overtime compensation due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Different capacity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order for employment in these  occasional or sporadic activities not to be considered subject to the  overtime requirements of section 7 of the FLSA, the regular government  employment of the individual performing them must also be in a different  capacity, i.e., it must not fall within the same general occupational  category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In general, the Administrator will consider the duties and other  factors contained in the definitions of the 3-digit categories of  occupations in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (except in the case  of public safety employees as discussed below in section (3)), as well  as all the facts and circumstances in a particular case, in determining  whether employment in a second capacity is substantially different from  the regular employment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For example, if a public park employee primarily engaged in  playground maintenance also from time to time cleans an evening  recreation center operated by the same agency, the additional work would  be considered hours worked for the same employer and subject to the  Act's overtime requirements because it is not in a different capacity.  This would be the case even though the work was occasional or sporadic,  and, was not regularly scheduled. Public safety employees taking on any  kind of security or safety function within the same local government are  never considered to be employed in a different capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> However, if a bookkeeper for a municipal park agency or a city  mail clerk occasionally referees for an adult evening basketball league  sponsored by the city, the hours worked as a referee would be considered  to be in a different general occupational category than the primary  employment and would not be counted as hours worked for overtime  purposes on the regular job. A person regularly employed as a bus driver  may assist in crowd control, for example, at an event such as a winter  festival, and in doing so, would be deemed to be serving in a different  capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In addition, any activity traditionally associated with teaching  (e.g., coaching, career counseling, etc.) will not be considered as  employment in a different capacity. However, where personnel other than  teachers engage in such teaching-related activities, the work will be  viewed as employment in a different capacity, provided that these  activities are performed on an occasional or sporadic basis and all  other requirements for this provision are   met. For example, a school secretary could substitute as a coach for a  basketball team or a maintenance engineer could provide instruction on  auto repair on an occasional or sporadic basis.</p>
