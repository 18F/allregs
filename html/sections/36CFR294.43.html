                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A road may not be constructed or reconstructed in a  Colorado Roadless Area except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph  (a) of this section, a road may only be constructed or reconstructed in  Colorado Roadless Area upper tier acres if the responsible official  determines that the conditions in subsection 1 or 2 are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A road is needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or  as provided for by statute or treaty, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A road is needed to protect public health and safety in cases of  an imminent threat of flood, fire or other catastrophic event that,  without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any road construction/reconstruction authorized pursuant to  this provision, subject to the legal rights   identified in 36 CFR 294.43(b)(1), the responsible official must  determine:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Motorized access, without road construction is not feasible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When proposing to construct a forest road, that a temporary  road would not provide reasonable access;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Road construction is consistent with the applicable land  management plan direction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified  recovery watershed, road construction will not diminish, over the long- term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the  occupied native cutthroat trout habitat; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all  projects occurring in native cutthroat trout habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in  paragraph (a) of this section, a road or temporary road may only be  constructed or reconstructed in Colorado Roadless Areas outside upper  tier acres if the responsible official determines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That one of the following exceptions exists:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A road is needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or  as provided for by statute or treaty;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Road realignment is needed to prevent irreparable resource  damage that arises from the design, location, use, or deterioration of a  forest road and that cannot be mitigated by road maintenance. Road  realignment may occur under this paragraph only if the road is deemed  essential for administrative or public access, public health and safety,  or uses authorized under permit, easement or other legal instrument;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Road reconstruction is needed to implement a road safety  improvement project on a forest road determined to be hazardous on the  basis of accident experience or accident potential on that road;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The Regional Forester determines a road or temporary road is  needed to allow for the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of  an authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a  pre-existing water court decree with the use of the road limited to the  water right identified in the pre-existing water court decree (see also  Sec. 294.44(b)(2));</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A temporary road is needed to protect public health and safety  in cases of imminent threat of flood, fire, or other catastrophic event  that, without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The Regional Forester determines a temporary road is needed to  facilitate tree cutting, sale, or removal (Sec. 294.42(c)(1)) within  the first one-half mile of the community protection zone to reduce the  wildfire hazard to an at-risk community or municipal water supply  system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The Regional Forester determines a temporary road is needed to  facilitate tree cutting, sale, or removal (Sec. 294.42(c)(3)) within  the first one-half mile of the community protection zone to maintain or  restore characteristics of ecosystem composition, structure and  processes;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A temporary road is needed within a Colorado Roadless Area  pursuant to the exploration or development of an existing oil and gas  lease that does not prohibit road construction or reconstruction,  including the construction of infrastructure necessary to transport the  product, on National Forest System lands that are under lease issued by  the Secretary of the Interior as of July 3, 2012. The Forest Service  shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request  for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if  doing so would result in any road construction within a Colorado  Roadless Area beyond that which was authorized by the terms and  conditions of the lease at the time of issuance; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A temporary road is needed for coal exploration and/or coal- related surface activities for certain lands within Colorado Roadless  Areas in the North Fork coal mining area of the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre,  and Gunnison National Forests as defined by the North Fork coal mining  area displayed on the final Colorado Roadless Areas map. Such roads may  also be used for collecting and transporting coal mine methane. Any  buried infrastructure, including pipelines, needed for the capture,  collection, and use of coal mine methane, will be located within the   rights-of-way of temporary roads that are otherwise necessary for coal- related surface activities including the installation and operation of  methane venting wells.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If proposed road construction/reconstruction meets one of the  exceptions, subject to the legal rights identified in Sec.  294.43(c)(1), the responsible official must determine:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Motorized access, without road construction is not feasible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When proposing to construct a forest road, that a temporary  road would not provide reasonable access;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Road construction is consistent with the applicable land  management plan direction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified  recovery watershed, road construction will not diminish, over the long- term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the  occupied native cutthroat trout habitat; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all  projects occurring in native cutthroat trout habitat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Road construction/reconstruction/decommissioning project  implementation and management. The following elements will be  incorporated into any road construction/reconstruction projects  implemented within Colorado Roadless Areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Road construction/reconstruction. If it is determined that a  road is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area, conduct construction in  a manner that reduces effects on surface resources, and prevents  unnecessary or unreasonable surface disturbance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Road decommissioning. Decommission any road and restore the  affected landscape when it is determined that the road is no longer  needed for the established purpose prior to, or upon termination or  expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, if possible; or upon  termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit,  whichever is sooner. Require the inclusion of a road decommissioning  provision in all contracts or permits. Design decommissioning to  stabilize, restore, and revegetate unneeded roads to a more natural  state to protect resources and enhance roadless area characteristics.  Examples include obliteration, denial of use, elimination of travelway  functionality, and removal of the road prism (restoration of the road  corridor to the original contour and hydrologic function).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Road designations. The designation of a temporary road  constructed or reconstructed pursuant to this subpart may not be changed  to forest road except where a forest road is allowed under paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Road use. Use of motor vehicles for administrative purposes by  the Forest Service and by fire, emergency, or law enforcement personnel  is allowed. All roads constructed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section shall prohibit public motorized vehicles (including off- highway vehicles) except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where specifically used for the purpose for which the road was  established; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Motor vehicle use that is specifically authorized under a  Federal law or regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Road maintenance. Maintenance of roads is permissible in  Colorado Roadless Areas.</p>
