                                Sec. 1.803-1  Life insurance reserves.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term ``life insurance reserves'' is defined in section 803(b). Generally, such reserves, as in the case of level premium life insurance, are held to supplement the future premium receipts when the latter, alone, are insufficient to cover the increased risk in the later years. In the case of

cancellable health and accident policies and similar cancellable contracts, the unearned premiums held to cover the risk for the unexpired period covered by the premiums are not included in life insurance reserves. Unpaid loss reserves for noncancellable health and accident policies are included in life insurance reserves if they are computed or estimated on the basis of recognized mortality or morbidity tables and assumed rates of interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an assessment life insurance company or association, life insurance reserves include sums actually deposited by such company or association with State or Territorial officers pursuant to law as guaranty or reserve funds, and any funds maintained under the charter or articles of incorporation or association of such company or association, or bylaws (approved by the State insurance commissioner) of such company or association, exclusively for the payment of claims arising under certificates of membership or policies issued upon the assessment plan and not subject to any other use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Life insurance reserves, except as otherwise provided in section 803(b), must be required by law either by express statutory provisions or by rules and regulations of the insurance department of a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia when promulgated in the exercise of a power conferred by statute but such requirement, without more, is not conclusive; for example, life insurance reserves do not include reserves required to be maintained to provide for the ordinary running expenses of a business which must be currently paid by every company from its income if its business is to continue, such as taxes, salaries, and unpaid brokerage; nor do they include the net value of risks reinsured in other solvent companies; liability for premiums paid in advance; liability for annual and deferred dividends declared or apportioned; liability for dividends left on deposit at interest; liability for accrued but unsettled policy claims whether known or unreported; liability for supplementary contracts not involving, at the time with respect to which the liability is computed, life, health, or accident contingencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In any case where reserves are claimed, sufficient information must be filed with the return to enable the district director to determine the validity of the claim. Only reserves which are required by law or insurance department ruling, which are peculiar to insurance companies, and which are dependent upon interest earnings for their maintenance will, except as otherwise specifically provided in section 803(b), be considered as life insurance reserves. A company is permitted to make use of the highest aggregate reserve required by any State or Territory or the District of Columbia in which it transacts business, but the reserve must have been actually held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the case of life insurance companies issuing policies covering life, health, and accident insurance combined in one policy issued on the weekly premium payment plan, continuing for life and not subject to cancellation, it is required that reserve funds thereon be based upon recognized mortality or morbidity tables covering disability benefits of the kind contained in policies issued by this particular class of companies but they need not be required by law.</p>
