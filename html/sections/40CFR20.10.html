L. 94- 455, October 4, 1976) amended section 169 of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1954, ``Amortization of Pollution Control Facilities.'' The amendment  made permanent the rapid amortization provisions of section 704 of the  Tax Reform Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-172, December 30, 1969) and redefined  eligibility limits to allow certification of facilities which prevent  the creation or emission of pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">The law defines a certified pollution control facility as a new  identifiable treatment facility which is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Used in connection with a plant or other property in operation  before January 1, 1976, to abate or control air or water pollution by  removing, altering, disposing of, storing, or preventing the creation or  emission of pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Constructed, reconstructed, erected or (if purchased) first  placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1975;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Not to significantly increase the output or capacity, extend the  useful life, alter the nature of the manufacturing or production process  or facility or reduce the total operating costs of the operating unit of  the plant or other property most directly associated with the pollution  control facility (as suggested by the legislative history, EPA  regulations define the term significant as any increase, reduction or  extension greater than 5%); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> (A) and (B) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0">If the facility is a building, the statute requires that it be  exclusively devoted to pollution control. Most questions as to whether a  facility is a building and, if so, whether it is exclusively devoted to  pollution control are resolved by Sec. 1.169-2(b)(2) of the Treasury  Department regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Since a treatment facility is eligible only if it furthers the  general policies of the United States under the Clean Air Act and the  Clean Water Act, a facility will be certified only if its purpose is to  improve the quality of the air or water outside the plant. Facilities to  protect the health or safety of employees inside the plant are not  eligible.</p><p class="depth0">Facilities installed before January 1, 1976, in plants placed in  operation after December 31, 1968, are ineligible for certification  under the statute. 26 U.S.C. 169.</p><p class="depth0">2. Air pollution control facilities.</p><p class="depth0">a. Pollution control or treatment facilities normally eligible for  certification. The following devices are illustrative of facilities for  removal, alteration, disposal, storage or preventing the creation or  emission of air pollution:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inertial separators (cyclones, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wet collection devices (scrubbers).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Electrostatic precipitators.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cloth filter collectors (baghouses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Director fired afterburners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Catalytic afterburners.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Gas absorption equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Vapor condensers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Vapor recovery systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Floating roofs for storage tanks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Fuel cleaning equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Combinations of the above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Air Pollution control facility boundaries. Most facilities are  systems consisting of several parts. A facility need not start at the  point where the gaseous effluent leaves the last unit of the processing  equipment, nor will it always extend to the point where the effluent is  emitted to the atmosphere or existing stack, breeching, ductwork or  vent. It includes all the auxiliary equipment used to operate the  control system, such as fans, blowers, ductwork, valves, dampers and  electrical equipment. It also includes all equipment used to handle,  store, transport or dispose of the collected pollutants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples of eligibility limits. The amortization deduction is  limited to new identifiable treatment facilities which remove, alter,  destroy, dispose of, store, or prevent the creation or emission of  pollutants, contaminants or wastes. It is not available for all  expenditures for air pollution control and is limited to devices which  are installed for the purpose of pollution control and which actually  remove, alter, destroy, dispose of, store or prevent the creation or  emission of pollutants by removing potential pollutants at any stage of  the production process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Boiler modifications or replacements. Modifications of boilers  to accommodate cleaner fuels are not eligible for rapid amortization:  e.g., removal of stokers from a coal-fired boiler and the addition of  gas or oil burners. The purpose of the burners is to produce heat, and  they are not identifiable as treatment facilities nor do they prevent  the creation or emission of pollutants by removing potential pollutants.  A new gas or oil-fired boiler that replaces a coal-fired boiler would  also be ineligible for certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuel processing. Eligible air pollution control facilities  include preprocessing equipment which removes potential air pollutants  from fuels before they are burned. A desulfurization facility would thus  be eligible provided it is used in connection with the plant where the  desulfurized coal will be burned or is used as a centralized facility  for one or more plants. However, fluidized bed facilities would  generally not be eligible for rapid amortization. Such facilities would  almost certainly increase output or capacity, reduce total operating  costs, or extend the useful life of the plant or other property by more  than 5%, since the boiler itself would be the operating unit of the  plant most closely associated with the pollution control facility. Where  the Regional Office and the taxpayer disagree as to the applicability of  the 5% rule, the Regional office should nonetheless certify the facility  if it is otherwise eligible and leave the ultimate determination to the  Treasury Department. The certification should alert Treasury to the  possibility that the facility is ineligible for rapid amortization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incinerators. The addition of an afterburner, secondary  combustion chamber or particulate collector would be eligible as would  any device added to effect more efficient combustion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Collection devices used to collect products or process material.  In some manufacturing operations, devices are used to collect product or  process material, as in the case of the manufacture of carbon black. The  baghouse would be eligible for certification, but the certification  should notify the Treasury Department of the profitable waste recovery  involved. (See paragraph 8 below.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Intermittent control systems. Measuring devices which inform the  taxpayer that ambient air quality standards are being exceeded are not  eligible for certification since they do not physically remove, alter,  destroy, dispose of, store or prevent the creation or emission of  pollutants, but merely act as a signal to curtail operations. Of course,  measuring devices used in connection with an eligible pollution control  facility would be eligible.</p><p class="depth0">d. Replacement of manufacturing process by another, nonpolluting  process. An installation does not qualify for certification where it  uses a process known to be cleaner than an alternative, but which does  not actually remove, alter, destroy, dispose of, store or prevent the  creation or emission of pollutants by removing potential pollutants at  any stage in the production process. For example, a minimally polluting  electric induction furnace to melt cast iron which replaces, or is  installed instead of, a heavily polluting iron cupola furnace would be  ineligible for this reason and because it is not an identifiable  treatment facility. However, if the replacement equipment has an air  pollution control device added to it, the control device would be  eligible even though the process equipment would not. For example, where  a primary copper smelting reverberatory furnace is replaced by a flash  smelting furnace, followed by the installation of a contact sulfuric  acid plant, the acid plant would qualify since it is a control device  not necessary to the production process. The flash smelting furnace  would not qualify because its purpose is to produce copper matte.</p><p class="depth0">3. Water Pollution Control Facilities.</p><p class="depth0">a. Pollution control or treatment facilities normally eligible for  certification. The following types of equipment are illustrative of  facilities to remove, alter, destroy, store or prevent the creation of  water pollution:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pretreatment facilities which neutralize or stabilize industrial  or sanitary wastes, or both, from a point immediately preceding the  point of such treatment to the point of disposal to, and acceptance by,  a publicly-owned treatment works. The necessary pumping and transmitting  facilities are also eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment facilities which neutralize or stabilize industrial or  sanitary wastes, or both, to comply with Federal, State or local   effluent or water quality standards, from a point immediately preceding  the point of such treatment to the point of disposal, including  necessary pumping and transmitting facilities, including those for  recycle or segregation of wastewater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ancillary devices and facilities such as lagoons, ponds and  structures for storage, recycle, segregation or treatment, or any  combination of these, of wastewaters or wastes from a plant or other  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Devices, equipment or facilities constructed or installed for  the primary purpose of recovering a by-product of the operation  (saleable or otherwise) previously lost either to the atmosphere or to  the waste effluent. Examples are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A facility to concentrate and recover vaporous by-products from  a process stream for reuse as raw feedstock or for resale, unless the  estimated profits from resale exceed the cost of the facility (see  paragraph 8 below).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A facility to concentrate or remove gunk or similar tars or  polymerized tar-like materials from the process waste effluent  previously discharged in the plant effluents. Removal may occur at any  stage of the production process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A device used to extract or remove insoluble constitutents from  a solid or liquid by use of a selective solvent; an open or closed tank  or vessel in which such extraction or removal occurs; a diffusion  battery of tanks or vessels for countercurrent decantation, extraction,  or leaching, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A skimmer or similar device for removing grease, oils and fat- like materials from the process or effluent stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples of eligibility limits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In-plant process changes  which may result in the reduction or elimination of pollution but which  do not themselves remove, alter, destroy, dispose of, store or prevent  the creation of pollutants by removing potential pollutants at some  point in the process stream are not eligible for certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A device, piece of equipment or facility is not eligible if it  is associated with or included in a stream for subsurface injection of  untreated or inadequately treated industrial or sanitary waste.</p><p class="depth0">4. Multiple-purpose facilities. A facility can qualify for rapid  amortization if it serves a function other than the abatement of  pollution (unless it is a building). Otherwise, the effect might be to  discourage installation of sensible pollution abatement facilities in  favor of less efficient single-function facilities.</p><p class="depth0">The regulations require applicants to state what percentage of the  cost of a facility is properly allocable to its abatement function and  to justify the allocation. The Regional Office will review these  allocations, and the certification will inform the Treasury Department  if the allocation appears to be incorrect. Although not generally  necessary or desireable, site inspections may be appropriate in cases  involving large sums of money or unusual types of equipment.</p><p class="depth0">5. Facilities serving both old and new plants. The statute provides  that pollution control facilities must be used in connection with a  plant or other property in operation before January 1, 1976. When a  facility is used in connection with both pre-1976 and newer property, it  may qualify for rapid amortization to the extent it is used in  connection with pre-1976 property.</p><p class="depth0">Again, the applicant will submit a theory of allocation for review  by the Regional Office. The usual method of allocation is to compare the  effluent capacity of the pre-1976 plant to the treatment capacity of the  control facility. For example, if the old plant has a capacity of 80  units of effluent (but an average output of 60 units), the new plant has  a capacity of 40 units (but an average output of 20 units), and the  control facility has a capacity of 150 units, then \80/150\ of the cost  of the control facility would be eligible for rapid amortization.</p><p class="depth0">If a taxpayer presents a seemingly reasonable method of allocation  different from the foregoing, Regional Office personnel should consult  with the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards or the Office of  Water Planning and Standards, and with the Office of General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0">6. State certification. To qualify for rapid amortization under  section 169, a facility must first be certified by the State as having  been installed ``in conformity with the State program or requirements  for abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution or  contamination.'' Significantly, the statute does not say that the State  must require that a facility be installed. If use of a facility will not  actually contravene a State requirement, the State may certify. However,  since State certification is a prerequisite to EPA certification, EPA  may not certify if the State has denied certification for whatever  reason.</p><p class="depth0">It should be noted that certification of a facility does not  constitute the personal warranty of the certifying official that the  conditions of the statute have been met. EPA certification is binding on  the Government only to the extent the submitted facts are accurate and  complete.</p><p class="depth0">7. Dispersal of pollutants. Section 169 applies to facilities which  remove, alter, destroy, dispose of, store or prevent the creation or  emission of pollutants--including heat. Facilities which merely disperse  pollutants (such as tall stacks) do not qualify. However, there is no  way to dispose of heat other than by transferring B.t.u.'s to the  environment. A cooling tower is therefore eligible for certification  provided it is used in connection with a pre-1976 plant. A cooling pond  or an   addition to an outfall structure which results in a decrease in the  amount by which the temperature of the receiving water is raised and  which meets applicable State standards is likewise eligible.</p><p class="depth0">8. Profit-making facilities. The statute denies rapid amortization  where the cost of pollution control facilities will be recovered from  profits derived through the recovery or wastes or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0">If a facility recovers marketable wastes, estimated profits on which  are not sufficient to recover the entire cost of the facility, the  amortization basis of the facility will be reduced in accordance with  Treasury Department regulations. The responsibility of the Regional  Offices is merely to identify for the Treasury Department those cases in  which estimated profits will arise. The Treasury Department will  determine the amount of such profits and the extent to which they can be  expected to result in cost recovery, but the EPA certification should  inform the Treasury whether cost recovery is possible.</p><p class="depth0">The phrase or otherwise also includes situations where the taxpayer  is in the business of renting the facility for a fee or charging for the  treatment of waste. In such cases, the facility may theoretically  qualify for EPA certification. The decision as to the extent of its  profitability is for the Treasury Department. Situations may also arise  where use of a facility is furnished at no additional charge to a number  of users, or to the public, as part of a package of other services. In  such cases, no profits will be deemed to arise from operation of the  facility unless the other services included in the package are merely  ancillary to use of the facility. Of course, the cost recovery provision  does not apply where a taxpayer merely recovers the cost of a facility  through general revenues; otherwise no profitable firm would ever be  eligible for rapid amortization.</p><p class="depth0">It should be noted that Sec. 20.9 of the EPA regulation is not meant  to affect general principles of Federal income tax law. An individual  other than the title holder of a piece of property may be entitled to  take depreciation deductions on it if the arrangements by which such  individual has use of the property may, for all practical purposes, be  viewed as a purchase. In any such case, the facility could qualify for  full rapid amortization, notwithstanding the fact that the title holder  charges a separate fee for the use of the facility, so long as the  taxpayer--in such a case, the user--does not charge a separate fee for  use of the facility.</p><p class="depth0">9. Multiple applications. Under EPA regulations, a multiple  application may be submitted by a taxpayer who applies for certification  of substantially identical pollution abatement facilities used in  connection with substantially identical properties. It is not  contemplated that the multiple application option will be used with  respect to facilities in different States, since each such facility  would require a separate application for certification to the State  involved. EPA regulations also permit an applicant to incorporate by  reference in an application material contained in an application  previously filed. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the burden  of furnishing detailed information (which may in some cases include  portions of catalogs or process flow diagrams) which the certifying  official has previously received. Accordingly, material filed with a  Regional Office of EPA may be incorporated by reference only in an  application subsequently filed with the same Regional Office.  [47 FR 38319, Aug. 31, 1982]</p>
