System managers shall ensure that at the time information is solicited the solicited individual is informed of the authority for collecting that information, whether providing the information is mandatory or voluntary, the purpose for which the information will be used, the routine uses to be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing the information. The Director, Records Management Division, Office of Management and Regional Administrators shall ensure that forms used to solicit information are in compliance with the Act and these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Solicitation of Social Security numbers.

If solicitation of the social security number is authorized under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, the FEMA employee who requests an individual to disclose the social security account number shall first inform that individual whether that disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority the number is solicited, and the use that will be made of it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Soliciting information from third parties. An employee of FEMA shall inform third parties who are requested to provide information about another individual of the purposes for which the information will be used.
