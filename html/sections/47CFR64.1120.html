                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No telecommunications carrier shall submit or execute a change  on the behalf of a subscriber in the subscriber's selection of a  provider of telecommunications service except in accordance with the  procedures prescribed in this subpart. Nothing in this section shall  preclude any State commission from enforcing these procedures with  respect to intrastate services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No submitting carrier shall submit a change on the behalf of a  subscriber in the subscriber's selection of a provider of  telecommunications service prior to obtaining:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Authorization from the subscriber, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Verification of that authorization in accordance with the  procedures prescribed in this section. The submitting carrier shall  maintain and preserve records of verification of subscriber  authorization for a minimum period of two years after obtaining such  verification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An executing carrier shall not verify the submission of a change  in a subscriber's selection of a provider of telecommunications service  received from a submitting carrier. For an executing carrier, compliance  with the procedures described in this part shall be defined as prompt  execution, without any unreasonable delay, of changes that have been  verified by a submitting carrier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) providers shall be  excluded from the verification requirements of this part as long as they  are not required to provide equal access to common carriers for the  provision of telephone toll services, in accordance with 47 U.S.C.  332(c)(8).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where a telecommunications carrier is selling more than one type  of telecommunications service (e.g., local exchange, intraLATA toll, and  interLATA toll), that carrier must obtain separate authorization from  the subscriber for each service sold, although the authorizations may be  obtained within the same solicitation. Each authorization must be  verified separately from any other authorizations obtained in the same  solicitation. Each authorization must be verified in accordance with the  verification procedures prescribed in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No telecommunications carrier shall submit a preferred carrier  change order unless and until the order has been confirmed in accordance  with one of the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The telecommunications carrier has obtained the subscriber's  written or electronically signed authorization in a form that meets the  requirements of Sec. 64.1130; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The telecommunications carrier has obtained the subscriber's  electronic authorization to submit the preferred carrier change order.  Such authorization must be placed from the telephone number(s) on which  the preferred carrier is to be changed and must confirm the information  in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Telecommunications carriers  electing to confirm sales electronically shall establish one or more  toll-free telephone numbers exclusively for that purpose. Calls to the  number(s) will connect a subscriber to a voice response unit, or similar  mechanism, that records the required information regarding the preferred  carrier change, including automatically recording the originating  automatic number identification; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(iv)</em> of this section, the subscriber's oral authorization  to submit the preferred carrier change order that confirms and includes  appropriate verification data (e.g., the subscriber's date of birth or  social security number). The independent third party must not be owned,  managed, controlled, or directed by the carrier or the carrier's  marketing agent; must not have any financial incentive to confirm  preferred carrier change orders for the carrier or the carrier's  marketing agent; and must operate in a location physically separate from  the carrier or the carrier's marketing agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Methods of third party verification. Automated third party  verification systems and three-way conference calls may be used for  verification purposes so long as the requirements of paragraphs  (c)(3)(ii) through (c)(3)(iv) of this section are satisfied.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Carrier initiation of third party verification. A carrier or a  carrier's sales representative initiating a three-way conference call or  a call through an automated verification system must drop off the call  once the three-way connection has been established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requirements for content and format of third party  verification. Any description of the carrier change transaction by a  third party verifier must not be misleading, and all third party  verification methods shall elicit, at a minimum: The date of the  verification; the identity of the subscriber; confirmation that the  person on the call is authorized to make the carrier change;  confirmation that the person on the call wants to make the carrier  change; confirmation that the person on the call understands that a  carrier change, not an upgrade to existing service, bill consolidation,  or any other misleading description of the transaction, is being  authorized; the names of the carriers affected by the change (not  including the name of the displaced carrier); the   telephone numbers to be switched; and the types of service involved  (including a brief description of a service about which the subscriber  demonstrates confusion regarding the nature of that service). Except in  Hawaii, any description of interLATA or long distance service shall  convey that it encompasses both international and state-to-state calls,  as well as some intrastate calls where applicable. If the subscriber has  additional questions for the carrier's sales representative during the  verification, the verifier shall indicate to the subscriber that, upon  completion of the verification process, the subscriber will have  authorized a carrier change. Third party verifiers may not market the  carrier's services by providing additional information, including  information regarding preferred carrier freeze procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other requirements for third party verification. All third  party verifications shall be conducted in the same language that was  used in the underlying sales transaction and shall be recorded in their  entirety. In accordance with the procedures set forth in  64.1120(a)(1)(ii), submitting carriers shall maintain and preserve audio  records of verification of subscriber authorization for a minimum period  of two years after obtaining such verification. Automated systems must  provide consumers with an option to speak with a live person at any time  during the call.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any State-enacted verification procedures applicable to  intrastate preferred carrier change orders only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Telecommunications carriers must provide subscribers the option  of using one of the authorization and verification procedures specified  in Sec. 64.1120(c) in addition to an electronically signed  authorization and verification procedure under 64.1120(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A telecommunications carrier may acquire, through a sale or  transfer, either part or all of another telecommunica- tions carrier's  subscriber base without obtaining each subscriber's authorization and  verification in accordance with Sec. 64.1120(c), provided that the  acquiring carrier complies with the following streamlined procedures. A  telecommunications carrier may not use these streamlined procedures for  any fraudulent purpose, including any attempt to avoid liability for  violations under part 64, subpart K of the Commission rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No later than 30 days before the planned transfer of the  affected subscribers from the selling or transferring carrier to the  acquiring carrier, the acquiring carrier shall file with the  Commission's Office of the Secretary a letter notification in CC Docket  No. 00-257 providing the names of the parties to the transaction, the  types of telecommunications services to be provided to the affected  subscribers, and the date of the transfer of the subscriber base to the  acquiring carrier. In the letter notification, the acquiring carrier  also shall certify compliance with the requirement to provide advance  subscriber notice in accordance with Sec. 64.1120(e)(3), with the  obligations specified in that notice, and with other statutory and  Commission requirements that apply to this streamlined process. In  addition, the acquiring carrier shall attach a copy of the notice sent  to the affected subscribers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, subsequent to the filing of the letter notification with the  Commission required by Sec. 64.1120(e)(1), any material changes to the  required information should develop, the acquiring carrier shall file  written notification of these changes with the Commission no more than  10 days after the transfer date announced in the prior notification. The  Commission reserves the right to require the acquiring carrier to send  an additional notice to the affected subscribers regarding such material  changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not later than 30 days before the transfer of the affected  subscribers from the selling or transferring carrier to the acquiring  carrier, the acquiring carrier shall provide written notice to each  affected subscriber of the information specified. The acquiring carrier  is required to fulfill the obligations set forth in the advance  subscriber notice. The advance subscriber notice shall be provided in a  manner consistent with 47 U.S.C. 255 and the Commission's rules  regarding accessibility to blind and visually-impaired consumers, 47   CFR 6.3, 6.5 of this chapter. The following information must be included  in the advance subscriber notice:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date on which the acquiring carrier will become the  subscriber's new provider of telecommunications service,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The rates, terms, and conditions of the service(s) to be  provided by the acquiring carrier upon the subscriber's transfer to the  acquiring carrier, and the means by which the acquiring carrier will  notify the subscriber of any change(s) to these rates, terms, and  conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The acquiring carrier will be responsible for any carrier  change charges associated with the transfer, except where the carrier is  acquiring customers by default, other than through bankruptcy, and state  law requires the exiting carrier to pay these costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The subscriber's right to select a different preferred carrier  for the telecommunications service(s) at issue, if an alternative  carrier is available,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> All subscribers receiving the notice, even those who have  arranged preferred carrier freezes through their local service providers  on the service(s) involved in the transfer, will be transferred to the  acquiring carrier, unless they have selected a different carrier before  the transfer date; existing preferred carrier freezes on the service(s)  involved in the transfer will be lifted; and the subscribers must  contact their local service providers to arrange a new freeze.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Whether the acquiring carrier will be responsible for handling  any complaints filed, or otherwise raised, prior to or during the  transfer against the selling or transferring carrier, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The toll-free customer service telephone number of the  acquiring carrier.
