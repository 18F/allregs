(for example, f.o.b. Laredo, Tex., or f.o.b. California) means that the produce quoted or sold is to be placed free on board the boat, car, or other agency of the through land transportation at shipping point, in suitable shipping condition (see definitions of ``suitable shipping condition,'' paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section), and that the buyer assumes all risk of damage and delay in transit not caused by the seller irrespective of how the shipment is billed.

If a good delivery standard for a commodity is set forth in Sec. 46.44, and that commodity at the contract destination contains deterioration in excess of any tolerance provided therein, it will be considered abnormally deteriorated.

Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a ``tramp car'' is sold f.o.b. shipping point or a ``tramp car sale'' is made f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be deemed to assume only the lowest authorized all-rail freight charges applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract destination agreed upon between the parties, together with such other charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped direct to the contract destination: Provided, That the buyer is not liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Rolling acceptance means that the buyer accepts at time of purchase produce which is in the custody of the transportation company and under movement from shipping point, under the terms and conditions described in paragraphs (q) and (r) of this section, except that the buyer assumes full responsibility for transportation of the goods from time of purchase, has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition after time of purchase unless the goods at the time of sale were not in suitable shipping condition, and has no right of rejection on arrival. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the shipper and not by rejection of the shipment. By agreement between the parties, however, the purchase may be made subject to inspection at any specified point while the car is rolling or in transit and the point at which the buyer will assume transportation charges may be specified without affecting the time of acceptance of the commodity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Rolling acceptance final means the same as Rolling acceptance except that the buyer has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition of the produce in transit. The buyer has recourse against the seller for any material breach of the contract providing the shipment is not rejected.
