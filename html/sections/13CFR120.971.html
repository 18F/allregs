The portion of the processing fee paid by the Borrower may be reimbursed from the Debenture proceeds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Closing fee. The CDC may charge a reasonable closing fee sufficient to reimburse it for the expenses of its in-house or outside legal counsel, and other miscellaneous closing costs (CDC Closing Fee).

The servicing fee may be paid only from loan payments received. The fees may be accrued without interest and collected from the CSA when the payments are made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Late fees. Loan payments received after the 15th of each month may be subject to a late payment fee of 5 percent of the late payment or $100, whichever is greater.
