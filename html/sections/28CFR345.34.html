A refusal to assign  must be documented by a memorandum to the unit team listing reasons for  the refusal, with a copy to the position classification files in FPI.  Typically, the reasons should include other earlier (ordinarily within  the past twelve months) documented violations of the FPI inmate worker  standards or institution disciplinary regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The refusal to assign is to be rescinded when, in the judgment  of the SOI, the worker no longer constitutes a serious threat to the FPI  industrial operation.</p>
