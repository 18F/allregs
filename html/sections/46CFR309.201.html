Sec. 309.201 through 309.204 to prescribe the method for determining the values of stores and supplies on board a vessel when lost, for which claims for loss will be paid, and to prescribe the procedure for payment of claims for such loss, when stores and supplies are covered under a disbursements clause of a War Risk Hull Insurance Binder or a War Risk Hull Insurance Policy issued by the United States on forms prescribed by Sec. Sec. 308.106 and 308.107 of this chapter, or when stores and supplies are covered by a War Risk Disbursements Policy issued by the United States pursuant to section 1203(c) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1283(c)). The vessel values established by Sec. Sec. 309.1 through 309.8 (General Order 82) do not include any allowance for the loss of stores and supplies, as distinguished from equipment and spare parts which are included in such vessel values.</p>
