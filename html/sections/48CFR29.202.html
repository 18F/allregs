                            <p class="depth0">No Federal manufacturers' or special-fuels excise taxes are imposed in many contracting situations as, for example, when the supplies are for any of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The exclusive use of any State or political subdivision, including the District of Columbia (26 U.S.C. 4041 and 4221).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shipment for export to a foreign country or an outlying area of the United States. Shipment must occur within 6 months of the time title passes to the Government. When the exemption is claimed, the words ``for export'' must appear on the contract or purchase document, and the contracting officer must furnish the seller proof of export (see 26 CFR 48.4221-3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Further manufacture, or resale for further manufacture (this exemption does not include tires and inner tubes) (26 CFR 48.4221-2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use as fuel supplies, ships or sea stores, or legitimate equipment on vessels of war, including (1) aircraft owned by the United States and constituting a part of the armed forces and (2) guided missiles and pilotless aircraft owned or chartered by the United States. When this exemption is to be claimed, the purchase should be made on a tax-exclusive basis. The contracting officer shall furnish the seller an exemption certificate for Supplies for Vessels of War (an example is given in 26 CFR 48.4221-4(d)(2); the IRS will accept one certificate covering all orders under a single contract for a specified period of up to 12 calendar quarters) (26 U.S.C. 4041 and 4221).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A nonprofit educational organization (26 U.S.C. 4041 and 4221).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emergency vehicles (26 U.S.C. 4053 and 4064(b)(1)(c)).
