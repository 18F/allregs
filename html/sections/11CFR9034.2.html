                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contributions meeting the following requirements will be considered matchable campaign contributions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contribution shall be a gift of money made: By an individual; by a written instrument and for the purpose of influencing the result of a primary election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only a maximum of $250 of the aggregate amount contributed by an individual may be matched.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before a contribution may be submitted for matching, it must actually be received by the candidate or any of the candidate's authorized committees and deposited in a designated campaign depository maintained by the candidate's authorized committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The written instrument used in making the contribution must be dated, physically received and deposited by the candidate or authorized committee on or after January l of the year immediately preceding the calendar year of the Presidential election, but no later than December 31 following the matching payment period as defined under 11 CFR 9032.6. Donations received by an individual who is testing the waters pursuant to 11 CFR 100.72(a) and 100.131(a) may be matched when the individual becomes a candidate if such donations meet the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this section, the term written instrument means a check written on a personal, escrow or trust account representing or containing the contributor's personal funds; a money order; any similar negotiable instrument; or, for contributions by credit or debit card, a paper record, or an electronic record that can be reproduced on paper, of the transaction. For purposes of this section, the term written instrument also means, in the case of a contribution by a credit card or debit card, either a transaction slip or other writing signed by the cardholder, or in the case of such a contribution made over the Internet, an electronic record of the transaction created and transmitted by the cardholder, and including the name of the cardholder and the card number, which can be maintained electronically and reproduced in a written form by the recipient candidate or candidate's committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The written instrument shall be: Payable on demand; and to the order of, or specifically endorsed without qualification to, the Presidential candidate, or his or her authorized committee. The written instrument shall contain: The full name and signature of the contributor(s); the amount and date of the contribution; and the mailing address of the contributor(s). For purposes of this section, the term signature means, in the case of a contribution by a credit card or debit card, either an actual signature by the cardholder who is the donor on a transaction slip or other writing, or in the case of such a contribution made over the Internet, the full name and card number of the cardholder who is the donor, entered and transmitted by the cardholder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In cases of a check drawn on a joint checking account, the contributor is considered to be the owner whose signature appears on the check.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To be attributed equally to other joint tenants of the account, the check or other accompanying written document shall contain the signature(s) of the joint tenant(s). If a contribution on a joint account is to be attributed other than equally to the joint tenants, the check or other written documentation shall also indicate the amount to be attributed to each joint tenant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a check for a contribution attributed to more than one person, where it is not apparent from the face of the check that each contributor is a joint tenant of the account, a written statement shall accompany the check stating that the contribution was made from each individual's personal funds in the amount so attributed and shall be signed by each contributor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a contribution reattributed to a joint tenant of the account, the reattribution shall comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 110.1(k) and the documentation described in 11 CFR 110.1 (1), (3), (5) and (6) shall accompany the reattributed contribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contributions in the form of checks drawn on an escrow or trust account are matchable contributions, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contributor has equitable ownership of the account; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The check is accompanied by a statement, signed by each contributor to whom all or a portion of the contribution is being attributed, together with the check number, amount and date of contribution. This statement shall specify that the contributor has equitable ownership of the account and the account represents the personal funds of the contributor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contributions in the form of checks written on partnership accounts or accounts of unincorporated associations or businesses are matchable contributions, so long as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The check is accompanied by a statement, signed by each contributor to whom all or a portion of the contribution is being attributed, together with the check number, amount and date of contribution. This statement shall specify that the contribution is made with the contributor's personal funds and that the account on which the contribution is drawn is not maintained or controlled by an incorporated entity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount of the contributions drawn on a partnership or unincorporated association or business does not exceed $1,000 to any one Presidential candidate seeking nomination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Contributions in the form of money orders, cashier's checks, or other similar negotiable instruments are matchable contributions, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the time it is initially submitted for matching, such instrument is signed by each contributor and is accompanied by a statement which specifies that the contribution was made in the form of a money order, cashier's check, traveler's check, or other similar negotiable instrument, with the contributor's personal funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such statement identifies the date and amount of the contribution made by money order, cashier's check, traveler's check, or other similar negotiable instrument, the check or serial number, and the name of the issuer of the negotiable instrument; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Such statement is signed by each contributor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for the admission to any activity that primarily confers private benefits in the form of entertainment to the contributor (i.e., concerts, motion pictures) are matchable.

Contributions by credit card or debit card where the cardholder's name and card number are given to the recipient candidate or candidate's committee only orally are not matchable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence is submitted by the committee that the contributor has affirmed that the contribution is from personal funds and not from funds otherwise prohibited by law.
