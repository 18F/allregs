Equipment designed to separate unreacted or by-product material from the polymer product are to be included in this process section, provided at least some of the material is recovered for reuse in the process, off-site purification or treatment, or sale, at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. Otherwise such equipment are to be assigned to one of the other process sections, as appropriate. Equipment that treats recovered materials are to be included in this process section, but equipment that also treats raw materials are not to be included in this process section. The latter equipment are to be included in the raw materials preparation section. If equipment is used to return unreacted or by-product material directly to the same piece of process equipment from which it was emitted, then that equipment is considered part of the process section that contains the process equipment. If equipment is used to recover unreacted or by-product material from a process section and return it to another process section or a different piece of process equipment in the same process section or sends it off-site for purification, treatment, or sale, then such equipment are considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are not included in the material recovery section, but are covered under the standards applicable to the polymerization reaction section (Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) or (2)(ii)(A)).</p><p class="depth0">Operating day means, for the purposes of these standards, any calendar day during which equipment used in the manufacture of polymer was operating for at least 8 hours or one labor shift,

whichever is shorter. Only operating days shall be used in determining compliance with the standards specified in Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C). Any calendar day in which equipment is used for less than 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is less, is not an ``operating day'' and shall not be used as part of the rolling 14-day period for determining compliance with the standards specified in Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth0">Polyethylene means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight; see low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene.</p><p class="depth0">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) means a polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (BHET) by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using dimethyl terephthalate means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on the esterification of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.</p><p class="depth0">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using terephthalic acid means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on the esterification reaction of terephthalic acid (TPA) with ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.</p><p class="depth0">Polymerization reaction section means the equipment designed to cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (oligomers or low polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw materials for polymerization, e.g., esterification vessels. For the purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery process section.</p><p class="depth0">Polypropylene (PP) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent propylene by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Polystyrene (PS) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 80 percent styrene or para-methylstyrene by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Post-impregnation suspension process means a manufacturing process in which polystyrene beads are first formed in a suspension process, washed, dried, or otherwise finished and then added with a blowing agent to another reactor in which the beads and blowing agent are reacted to produce expandable polystyrene.</p><p class="depth0">Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubular coils, including all fluids except water that is heated to produce steam.</p><p class="depth0">Process line means a group of equipment assembled that can operate independently if supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process line consists of the equipment in the following process sections (to the extent that these process sections are present at a plant): raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, product finishing, product storage, and material recovery.</p><p class="depth0">Process section means the equipment designed to accomplish a general but well-defined task in polymer production. Process sections include raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, product finishing, and product storage and may be dedicated to a single process line or common to more than one process line.</p><p class="depth0">Process unit means equipment assembled to perform any of the physical and chemical operations in the production of polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable), or poly(ethylene

terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient storage facilities for the product. Examples of process units are raw materials handling and monomer recovery.</p><p class="depth0">Product finishing section means the equipment that treats, shapes, or modifies the polymer or resin to produce the finished end product of the particular facility, including equipment that prepares the product for product finishing. For the purposes of these standards, the product finishing section begins with the equipment used to transfer the polymerized product from the polymerization reaction section and ends with the last piece of equipment that modifies the characteristics of the polymer. Product finishing equipment may accomplish product separation, extruding and pelletizing, cooling and drying, blending, additives introduction, curing, or annealing. Equipment used to separate unreacted or by-product material from the product are to be included in this process section, provided the material separated from the polymer product is not recovered at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. If the material is being recovered, then the separation equipment are to be included in the material recovery section. Product finishing does not include polymerization, the physical mixing of the pellets to obtain a homogenous mixture of the polymer (except as noted below), or the shaping (such as fiber spinning, molding, or fabricating) or modification (such as fiber stretching and crimping) of the finished end product. If physical mixing occurs in equipment located between product finishing equipment (i.e., before all the chemical and physical characteristics have been ``set'' by virtue of having passed through the last piece of equipment in the product finishing section), then such equipment are to be included in this process section. Equipment used to physically mix the finished product that are located after the last piece of equipment in the product finishing section are part of the product storage section.</p><p class="depth0">Product storage section means the equipment that is designed to store the finished polymer or resin end product of the particular facility. For the purposes of these standards, the product storage section begins with the equipment used to transfer the finished product out of the product finishing section and ends with the containers used to store the final product. Any equipment used after the product finishing section to recover unreacted or by-product material are to be considered part of a material recovery section. Product storage does not include any intentional modification of the characteristics of any polymer or resin product, but does include equipment that provide a uniform mixture of product, provided such equipment are used after the last product finishing piece of equipment. This process section also does not include the shipment of a finished polymer or resin product to another facility for further finishing or fabrication.</p><p class="depth0">Raw materials preparation section means the equipment located at a polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of these standards, this process section begins with the equipment used to transfer raw materials from storage and recovered material from material recovery process sections, and ends with the last piece of equipment that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials preparation section may include equipment that accomplishes purification, drying, or other treatment of raw materials or of raw and recovered materials together, activation of catalysts, and esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains (oligomers), but does not include equipment that is designed primarily to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered materials alone, or the storage of raw materials.</p><p class="depth0">Recovery system means an individual unit or series of material recovery units, such as absorbers, condensers, and carbon adsorbers, used for recovering volatile organic compounds.</p><p class="depth0">Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured according to the procedures specified in Sec. 60.564.</p><p class="depth0">Vent stream means any gas stream released to the atmosphere directly from

an emission source or indirectly either through another piece of process equipment or a material recovery device that constitutes part of the normal recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or resale, and any gas stream directed to an air pollution control device. The emissions released from an air pollution control device are not considered a vent stream unless, as noted above, the control device is part of the normal material recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or resale.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means, for the purposes of these standards, any reactive organic compounds as defined in Sec. 60.2 Definitions.

Sec. 60.562-1  Standards: Process emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene. Each owner or operator of a polypropylene, low density polyethylene, or high density polyethylene process line containing a process section subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Continuous emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 60.560(a)(1), the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for determining which continuous emissions are to be controlled and which level of control listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is to be met. The owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section each time a process section is constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Level of control Continuous emission streams determined to be subject to control pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, as applicable, shall meet one of the control levels identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section identify which level of control may be met. The level of control identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section is limited to certain continuous emission streams, which are identified through the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Reduce emissions of total organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) (TOC) by 98 weight percent, or to a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) on a dry basis, whichever is less stringent. The TOC is expressed as the sum of the actual compounds, not carbon equivalents. If an owner or operator elects to comply with the 20 ppmv standard, the concentration shall include a correction to 3 percent oxygen only when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the vent stream.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Combust the emissions in a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater by introducing the vent stream into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater. (Note: A boiler or process heater of lesser design heat capacity may be used, but must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Combust the emissions in a flare that meets the conditions specified in Sec. 60.18. If the flare is used to control both continuous and intermittent emissions, the flare shall meet the conditions specified in Sec. 60.18 at all times (i.e., which controlling continuous emissions alone or when controlling both continuous and intermittent emissions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Vent the emissions to a control device located on the plant site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Uncontrolled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 60.560(a)(1) and that is not controlled in an existing control device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in

table 3 to identify those continuous emissions from each constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected facility that are to be controlled. The owner shall include in the procedure all uncontrolled continuous vent streams from previously constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected facilities at the plant site each time a process section is constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site. In applying the procedures shown in table 3, the stream characteristics may be either measured or calculated as specified in Sec. 60.564(d). For modified or reconstructed affected facilities, these stream characteristics are to be determined after a modification or reconstruction determination has been made by the Administrator, but before any actual changes have been undertaken, and then again after the actual changes have been made.

For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 60.560(a)(1) and that is controlled in an existing control device, each owner or operator shall determine whether the emissions entering the control device are greater

than or equal to the calculated threshold emissions (CTE) level, which is to be calculated using the TOC concentration of the inlet vent stream and the equations in footnote b of table 3. If the inlet stream's TOC concentration is equal to or greater than 20 weight percent, the calculated threshold emissions level is 18.2 Mg/yr (20.1 ton/yr). If multiple emission streams are vented to the control device, the individual streams are not to be separated into individual weight percent ranges for calculation purposes as would be done for uncontrolled emission streams. Emissions vented to an existing control device are required to be controlled as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Figure 2 illustrates the control determination procedure for controlled continuous emissions.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.049</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device are equal to or greater than the CTE levels, then compliance with one of the requirements identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at such time the control device is reconstructed or replaced or has its operating conditions modified as a result of State or local regulations (including changes in the operating permit) including those instances where the control device is reconstructed, replaced, or modified in its operation at the same time the existing process section

is modified or reconstructed and becomes an affected facility. If the existing control device already complies with one of the requirements identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C), no further control is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device are less than the CTE level, then the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) are not applicable at that time. However, if the control device is replaced, reconstructed, or modified at a later date, each owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of these standards. This is done by combining with the vent stream entering the control device any uncontrolled vent streams in the same weight percent range as the controlled vent stream and determining whether the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device plus the applicable uncontrolled vent streams are greater than or equal to the CTE level, which is based on the weighted TOC concentration of the controlled vent stream and the uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual emissions entering the control device (including the applicable uncontrolled vent streams) are greater than or equal to the CTE level, then compliance with one of the requirements identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at that time for both the controlled and uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual emissions are less than the CTE level, compliance with these standards is again not required at such time. However, if the control device is again replaced, reconstructed, or modified, each owner or operator shall repeat this determination procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intermittent emissions.
