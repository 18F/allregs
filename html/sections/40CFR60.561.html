This  includes intermittent vents that occur from process equipment where  normal operating parameters (e.g., pressure or temperature) are exceeded  such that the process equipment can not be returned to normal operating  conditions using the design features of the system and venting must  occur to avoid equipment failure or adverse safety personnel  consequences and to minimize adverse effects of the runaway reaction.  This does not include intermittent vents that are designed into the  process to maintain normal operating conditions of process vessels  including those vents that regulate normal process vessel pressure.</p><p class="depth2">End finisher means a polymerization reaction vessel operated under  very low pressures, typically at pressures of 2 mm Hg (1 in.

Equipment  designed to separate unreacted or by-product material from the polymer  product are to be included in this process section, provided at least  some of the material is recovered for reuse in the process, off-site  purification or treatment, or sale, at the time the process section  becomes an affected facility. Otherwise such equipment are to be  assigned to one of the other process sections, as appropriate. Equipment  that treats recovered materials are to be included in this process  section, but equipment that also treats raw materials are not to be  included in this process section. The latter equipment are to be  included in the raw materials preparation section. If equipment is used  to return unreacted or by-product material directly to the same piece of  process equipment from which it was emitted, then that equipment is  considered part of the process section that contains the process  equipment. If equipment is used to recover unreacted or by-product  material from a process section and return it to another process section  or a different piece of process equipment in the same process section or  sends it off-site for purification, treatment, or sale, then such  equipment are considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment  used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene  terephthalate) plants, however, are not included in the material  recovery section, but are covered under the standards applicable to the  polymerization reaction section (Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) or  (2)(ii)(A)).</p><p class="depth2">Operating day means, for the purposes of these standards, any  calendar day during which equipment used in the manufacture of polymer  was operating for at least 8 hours or one labor shift,   whichever is shorter. Only operating days shall be used in determining  compliance with the standards specified in Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B),  (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C). Any calendar day in which  equipment is used for less than 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is  less, is not an ``operating day'' and shall not be used as part of the  rolling 14-day period for determining compliance with the standards  specified in Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and  (2)(ii)(C).</p><p class="depth2">Polyethylene means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of  at least 50 percent ethylene by weight; see low density polyethylene and  high density polyethylene.</p><p class="depth2">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) means a polymer or copolymer  comprised of at least 50 percent bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate  (BHET) by weight.</p><p class="depth2">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using dimethyl  terephthalate means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate)  based on the esterification of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with  ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)- terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.</p><p class="depth2">Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using terephthalic  acid means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on  the esterification reaction of terephthalic acid (TPA) with ethylene  glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)- terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.</p><p class="depth2">Polymerization reaction section means the equipment designed to  cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed  primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (oligomers or  low polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw  materials for polymerization, e.g., esterification vessels. For the  purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins  with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials  preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which  polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of  ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are  included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery  process section.</p><p class="depth2">Polypropylene (PP) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer  comprised of at least 50 percent propylene by weight.</p><p class="depth2">Polystyrene (PS) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer  comprised of at least 80 percent styrene or para-methylstyrene by  weight.</p><p class="depth2">Post-impregnation suspension process means a manufacturing process  in which polystyrene beads are first formed in a suspension process,  washed, dried, or otherwise finished and then added with a blowing agent  to another reactor in which the beads and blowing agent are reacted to  produce expandable polystyrene.</p><p class="depth2">Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by  burning fuel to fluids contained in tubular coils, including all fluids  except water that is heated to produce steam.</p><p class="depth2">Process line means a group of equipment assembled that can operate  independently if supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce  polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or  expandable) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers.

Process sections include  raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery,  product finishing, and product storage and may be dedicated to a single  process line or common to more than one process line.</p><p class="depth2">Process unit means equipment assembled to perform any of the  physical and chemical operations in the production of polypropylene,  polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable), or  poly(ethylene   terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process unit can operate  independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and  sufficient storage facilities for the product. Examples of process units  are raw materials handling and monomer recovery.</p><p class="depth2">Product finishing section means the equipment that treats, shapes,  or modifies the polymer or resin to produce the finished end product of  the particular facility, including equipment that prepares the product  for product finishing. For the purposes of these standards, the product  finishing section begins with the equipment used to transfer the  polymerized product from the polymerization reaction section and ends  with the last piece of equipment that modifies the characteristics of  the polymer. Product finishing equipment may accomplish product  separation, extruding and pelletizing, cooling and drying, blending,  additives introduction, curing, or annealing. Equipment used to separate  unreacted or by-product material from the product are to be included in  this process section, provided the material separated from the polymer  product is not recovered at the time the process section becomes an  affected facility. If the material is being recovered, then the  separation equipment are to be included in the material recovery  section. Product finishing does not include polymerization, the physical  mixing of the pellets to obtain a homogenous mixture of the polymer  (except as noted below), or the shaping (such as fiber spinning,  molding, or fabricating) or modification (such as fiber stretching and  crimping) of the finished end product. If physical mixing occurs in  equipment located between product finishing equipment (i.e., before all  the chemical and physical characteristics have been ``set'' by virtue of  having passed through the last piece of equipment in the product  finishing section), then such equipment are to be included in this  process section. Equipment used to physically mix the finished product  that are located after the last piece of equipment in the product  finishing section are part of the product storage section.</p><p class="depth2">Product storage section means the equipment that is designed to  store the finished polymer or resin end product of the particular  facility. For the purposes of these standards, the product storage  section begins with the equipment used to transfer the finished product  out of the product finishing section and ends with the containers used  to store the final product. Any equipment used after the product  finishing section to recover unreacted or by-product material are to be  considered part of a material recovery section. Product storage does not  include any intentional modification of the characteristics of any  polymer or resin product, but does include equipment that provide a  uniform mixture of product, provided such equipment are used after the  last product finishing piece of equipment. This process section also  does not include the shipment of a finished polymer or resin product to  another facility for further finishing or fabrication.</p><p class="depth2">Raw materials preparation section means the equipment located at a  polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as  monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of these  standards, this process section begins with the equipment used to  transfer raw materials from storage and recovered material from material  recovery process sections, and ends with the last piece of equipment  that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials  preparation section may include equipment that accomplishes  purification, drying, or other treatment of raw materials or of raw and  recovered materials together, activation of catalysts, and  esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains  (oligomers), but does not include equipment that is designed primarily  to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered  materials alone, or the storage of raw materials.</p><p class="depth2">Recovery system means an individual unit or series of material  recovery units, such as absorbers, condensers, and carbon adsorbers,  used for recovering volatile organic compounds.</p><p class="depth2">Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured  according to the procedures specified in Sec. 60.564.</p><p class="depth2">Vent stream means any gas stream released to the atmosphere directly  from   an emission source or indirectly either through another piece of process  equipment or a material recovery device that constitutes part of the  normal recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential  emissions are recovered for recycle or resale, and any gas stream  directed to an air pollution control device. The emissions released from  an air pollution control device are not considered a vent stream unless,  as noted above, the control device is part of the normal material  recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions  are recovered for recycle or resale.</p><p class="depth2">Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means, for the purposes of these  standards, any reactive organic compounds as defined in Sec. 60.2  Definitions.
