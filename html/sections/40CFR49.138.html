                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? This section allows the  Regional Administrator to develop and maintain a current and accurate  record of air pollution sources and their emissions within the Indian  reservation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who is affected by this section? This section applies to any  person who owns or operates a part 71 source or an air pollution source  that is subject to a standard established under section 111 or section  112 of the Federal Clean Air Act. This section also applies to any  person who owns or operates any other air pollution source except those  exempted in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What is exempted from this section? As provided in paragraph (b)  of this section, this section does not apply to the following air  pollution sources:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Air pollution sources that do not have the potential to emit  more than two tons per year of any air pollutant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mobile sources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Single family residences, and residential buildings with four or  fewer dwelling units;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Air conditioning units used for human comfort that do not  exhaust air pollutants into the atmosphere from any manufacturing or  industrial process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Ventilating units used for human comfort that do not exhaust air  pollutants into the atmosphere from any manufacturing or industrial  process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Furnaces and boilers used exclusively for space heating with a  rated heat input capacity of less than 400,000 British thermal units  (Btu) per hour;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cooking of food, except for wholesale businesses that both cook  and sell cooked food;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Consumer use of office equipment and products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Janitorial services and consumer use of janitorial products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Maintenance and repair activities, except for air pollution  sources engaged in the business of maintaining and repairing equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Agricultural activities and forestry and silvicultural  activities, including agricultural burning and forestry and  silvicultural burning; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Open burning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What are the requirements of this section? Any person who owns  or operates an air pollution source subject to this section, except for  part 71 sources, must register the source with the Regional  Administrator and submit reports as specified in paragraph (e) of this  section. Any person who owns or operates a part 71 source must submit  reports as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. All registration  information and reports must be submitted on forms provided by the  Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Are there additional requirements that must be met? Any person  who owns or operates an air pollution source subject to this section,  except for part 71 sources, must register an air pollution source and  submit reports as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial registration. The owner or operator of an air pollution  source that exists on the effective date of this section must register  the air pollution source with the Regional Administrator by no later  than February 15, 2007. The owner or operator of a new air pollution  source must register with the Regional Administrator within 90 days  after beginning operation. Submitting an initial registration does not  relieve the owner or operator from the requirement to obtain a permit to  construct if the new air pollution source would be a new source or  modification subject to any Federal or Tribal permit to construct rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual registration. After initial registration, the owner or  operator of an air pollution source must re-register with the Regional  Administrator by February 15 of each year. The annual registration must  include all of the information required in the initial registration and  must be updated to reflect any changes since the previous registration.  For information that has not changed since the previous registration,  the owner or operator may reaffirm in writing that the information  previously furnished to the Regional Administrator is still correct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information to include in initial registration and annual  registration. Each initial registration and annual registration must  include the following information if it applies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of the air pollution source and the nature of the business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Street address, telephone number, and facsimile number of the  air pollution source.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Name, mailing address, and telephone number of the owner or  operator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Name, mailing address, telephone number, and facsimile number  of the local individual responsible for compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Name and mailing address of the individual authorized to receive  requests for data and information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A description of the production processes, air pollution  control equipment, and a related flow chart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Identification of emission units and air pollutant-generating  activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A plot plan showing the location of all emission units and  air pollutant-generating activities. The plot plan must also show the  property lines of the air pollution source, the height above grade of  each emission release point, and the distance and direction to the  nearest residential or commercial property.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Type and quantity of fuels, including the sulfur content of  fuels, used on a daily, annual, and maximum hourly basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Type and quantity of raw materials used or final product  produced on a daily, annual, and maximum hourly basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Typical operating schedule, including number of hours per day,  number of days per week, and number of weeks per year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Estimates of the total actual emissions from the air pollution  source for the following air pollutants: particulate matter, PM10,  PM2.5, sulfur oxides (SOX), nitrogen oxides (NOX),  carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), lead (Pb) and  lead compounds, ammonia (NH3), fluorides (gaseous and  particulate), sulfuric acid mist (H2SO4), hydrogen  sulfide (H2S), total reduced sulfur (TRS), and reduced sulfur  compounds, including all calculations for the estimates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Estimated efficiency of air pollution control equipment under  present or anticipated operating conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Any other information specifically requested by the Regional  Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedure for estimating emissions. The initial registration and  annual registration must include an estimate of actual emissions taking  into account equipment, operating conditions, and air pollution control  measures. For an existing air pollution source that operated during the  calendar year preceding the initial registration or annual registration  submittal, the actual emissions are the actual rate of emissions for the  preceding calendar year and must be calculated using the actual  operating hours, production rates, in-place control equipment, and types  of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the preceding  calendar year. For a new air pollution source that is submitting its  initial registration, the actual emissions are the estimated actual rate  of emissions for the current calendar year. The emission estimates must  be based upon actual test data or, in the absence of such data, upon  procedures acceptable to the Regional Administrator. Any emission  estimates submitted to the Regional Administrator must be verifiable  using currently accepted engineering criteria. The following procedures  are generally acceptable for estimating emissions from air pollution  sources:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Source-specific emission tests;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mass balance calculations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Published, verifiable emission factors that are applicable to  the source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other engineering calculations; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other procedures to estimate emissions specifically approved by  the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Report of relocation. After initial registration, the owner or  operator of an air pollution source must report any relocation of the  source to the Regional Administrator in writing no later than 30 days  prior to the relocation of the source. The report must update the  information required in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(v) and  (e)(3)(viii) of this section, and any other information required by  paragraph (e)(3) of this section if it will change as a result of the  relocation. Submitting a report of relocation does not relieve the owner  or operator from the requirement to obtain a permit to construct if the  relocation of the air pollution source would be a new source or  modification subject to any Federal or Tribal permit to construct rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Report of change of ownership. After initial registration, the  owner or operator of an air pollution source must report any change of  ownership to the Regional Administrator in writing within 90 days after  the change in ownership is effective. The report must update the  information required in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(v) of this  section, and any other information required by paragraph (e)(3) of this  section if it would change as a result of the change of ownership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Report of closure. Except for regular seasonal closures, after  initial registration, the owner or operator of an air pollution source  must submit a report of closure to the Regional Administrator in writing  within 90 days after the cessation of all operations at the air  pollution source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Certification of truth, accuracy, and completeness. All  registrations and reports must include a certification signed by the  owner or operator as to the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the  information. This certification must state that, based on information  and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the statements and  information are true, accurate, and complete.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements for part 71 sources. The owner or operator of a  part 71 source must submit an annual registration report that includes  the information required by paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this  section. This annual registration report must be submitted with the  annual emission report and fee calculation worksheet required by part 71  (or by the source's part 71 permit if a different date is specified in  the permit). The owner or operator may submit a single combined report  provided that the combined report clearly identifies which emissions are  the basis for the annual registration report, the part 71 annual  emission report, and the part 71 fee calculation worksheet. The first  annual registration report for a part 71 source shall be submitted for  calendar year 2006, or for the calendar year that the source became  subject to part 71, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Definitions of terms used in this section. The following terms  that are used in this section are defined in Sec. 49.123 General  provisions: Act, actual emissions, agricultural activities, air  pollutant, air pollution source, ambient air, British thermal unit  (Btu), emission, emission factor, emission unit, forestry or  silvicultural activities, forestry or silvicultural burning, fuel, major  source, marine vessel, mobile source, motor vehicle, new air pollution  source, nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, open burning, owner or  operator, part 71 source, particulate matter, permit to construct, PM10,  PM2.5, potential to emit, rated capacity, Regional Administrator,  source, stack, stationary source, and uncombined water.</p>
