                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prescription requirement. A seller may sell contact lenses only  in accordance with a contact lens prescription for the patient that is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Presented to the seller by the patient or prescriber directly or  by facsimile; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verified by direct communication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information for verification. When seeking verification of a  contact lens prescription, a seller shall provide the prescriber with  the following information through direct communication:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The patient's full name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contact lens power, manufacturer, base curve or appropriate  designation, and diameter when appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The quantity of lenses ordered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date of patient request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The date and time of verification request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The name of a contact person at the seller's company, including  facsimile and telephone numbers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the seller opts to include the prescriber's regular business  hours on Saturdays as ``business hours'' for purposes of paragraph  (c)(3) of this section, a clear statement of the prescriber's regular  Saturday business hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification events. A prescription is verified under paragraph  (a)(2) of this section only if one of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prescriber confirms the prescription is accurate by direct  communication with the seller;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prescriber informs the seller through direct communication  that the prescription is inaccurate and provides the accurate  prescription; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prescriber fails to communicate with the seller within eight  (8) business hours after receiving from the seller the information  described in paragraph (b) of this section. During these eight (8)  business hours, the seller shall provide a reasonable opportunity for  the prescriber to communicate with the seller concerning the  verification request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Invalid prescription. If a prescriber informs a seller before  the deadline under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that the contact  lens prescription is inaccurate, expired, or otherwise invalid, the  seller shall not fill the prescription. The prescriber shall specify the  basis for the inaccuracy or invalidity of the prescription. If the  prescription communicated by the seller to the prescriber is inaccurate,  the prescriber shall correct it, and the prescription shall then be  deemed verified under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No alteration of prescription. A seller may not alter a contact  lens prescription. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a seller may  substitute for private label contact lenses specified on a prescription  identical contact lenses that the same company manufactures and sells  under different labels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recordkeeping requirement--verification requests. A seller shall  maintain a record of all direct communications referred to in paragraph  (a) of this section. Such record shall consist of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For prescriptions presented to the seller: the prescription  itself, or the facsimile version thereof (including an email containing  a digital image of the prescription), that was presented to the seller  by the patient or prescriber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For verification requests by the seller:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the communication occurs via facsimile or e-mail, a copy of  the verification request, including the information provided to the  prescriber pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and confirmation  of the completed transmission thereof, including a record of the date  and time the request was made;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the communication occurs via telephone, a log:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Describing the information provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of  this section,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Setting forth the date and time the request was made,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Indicating how the call was completed, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Listing the names of the individuals who participated in the  call.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For communications from the prescriber, including prescription  verifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the communication occurs via facsimile or e-mail, a copy of  the communication and a record of the time and date it was received;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the communication occurs via telephone, a log describing the  information communicated, the date and time that the information was  received, and the names of the individuals who participated in the call.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The records required to be maintained under this section shall  be maintained for a period of not less than three years, and these  records must be available for inspection by the Federal Trade  Commission, its employees, and its representatives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordkeeping requirement--Saturday business hours. A seller  that exercises its option to include a prescriber's regular Saturday  business hours in the time period for verification specified in Sec.  315.5(c)(3) shall maintain a record of the prescriber's regular Saturday  business hours and the basis for the seller's actual knowledge thereof.
