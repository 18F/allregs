                            <p class="depth0">A swap execution facility shall establish trading, trade processing,  and participation rules that will deter abuses and have the capacity to  enforce such rules through prompt and effective disciplinary action,  including suspension or expulsion of members or market participants that  violate the rules of the swap execution facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enforcement staff. A swap execution facility shall establish and  maintain sufficient enforcement staff and resources to effectively and  promptly prosecute possible rule violations within the disciplinary  jurisdiction of the swap execution facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disciplinary panels. A swap execution facility shall establish  one or more disciplinary panels that are authorized to fulfill their  obligations under the rules of this subpart. Disciplinary panels shall  meet the composition requirements of part 40 of this chapter, and shall  not include any members of the swap execution facility's compliance  staff or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearings. A swap execution facility shall adopt rules that  provide for   the following minimum requirements for any hearing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hearing shall be fair, shall be conducted before members of  the disciplinary panel, and shall be promptly convened after reasonable  notice to the respondent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the respondent has requested a hearing, a copy of the hearing  shall be made and shall become a part of the record of the proceeding.  The record shall not be required to be transcribed unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transcript is requested by Commission staff or the  respondent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The decision is appealed pursuant to the rules of the swap  execution facility; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The decision is reviewed by the Commission pursuant to section  8c of the Act or part 9 of this chapter. In all other instances, a  summary record of a hearing is permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decisions. Promptly following a hearing conducted in accordance  with the rules of the swap execution facility, the disciplinary panel  shall render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence  contained in the record of the proceeding and shall provide a copy to  the respondent. The decision shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice of charges or a summary of the charges;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The answer, if any, or a summary of the answer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A summary of the evidence produced at the hearing or, where  appropriate, incorporation by reference of the investigation report;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of findings and conclusions with respect to each  charge, and a complete explanation of the evidentiary and other basis  for such findings and conclusions with respect to each charge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An indication of each specific rule that the respondent was  found to have violated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A declaration of all sanctions imposed against the respondent,  including the basis for such sanctions and the effective date of such  sanctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disciplinary sanctions. All disciplinary sanctions imposed by a  swap execution facility or its disciplinary panels shall be commensurate  with the violations committed and shall be clearly sufficient to deter  recidivism or similar violations by other market participants. All  disciplinary sanctions, including sanctions imposed pursuant to an  accepted settlement offer, shall take into account the respondent's  disciplinary history. In the event of demonstrated customer harm, any  disciplinary sanction shall also include full customer restitution,  except where the amount of restitution or to whom it should be provided  cannot be reasonably determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Warning letters. Where a rule violation is found to have  occurred, no more than one warning letter may be issued per rolling  twelve month period for the same violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Additional sources for compliance. A swap execution facility may  refer to the guidance and/or acceptable practices in appendix B of this  part to demonstrate to the Commission compliance with the requirements  of Sec. 37.206.</p>
