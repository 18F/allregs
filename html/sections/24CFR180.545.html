                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section governs the issuance of subpoenas in administrative proceedings under the Fair Housing Act. Except for time periods stated in the rules in this section, to the extent that this section conflicts with procedures for the issuance of subpoenas in civil actions in the United States District

Court for the District in which the investigation of the discriminatory housing practice took place, the rules of the United States District Court apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance of subpoena. Upon the written request of a party, the presiding ALJ or other designated ALJ may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness for the purpose of giving testimony at a deposition or hearing and requiring the production of relevant books, papers, documents or tangible things.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time of request. Requests for subpoenas in aid of discovery must be submitted in time to permit the conclusion of discovery 15 days before the date scheduled for the hearing. If a request for subpoenas of a witness for testimony at a hearing is submitted three days or less before the hearing, the subpoena shall be issued at the discretion of the presiding ALJ, or other designated ALJ as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service. A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service on a person shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person and by tendering witness fees and mileage to that person. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of HUD, witness fees and mileage need not be tendered with the subpoena.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amount of witness fees and mileage. A witness summoned by a subpoena issued under this part is entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as a witness in proceedings in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena shall be paid by the party requesting the issuance of the subpoena, or where the ALJ determines that a party is unable to pay the fees, the fees shall be paid by HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Motion to quash or limit subpoena. Upon a motion by the person served with a subpoena or by a party, made within five days after service of the subpoena (but in any event not less than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance), the ALJ may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Condition denial of the motion upon the advancement, by the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, of the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed books, papers or documents. Where circumstances require, the ALJ may act upon such a motion at any time after a copy of the motion has been served upon the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to comply with subpoena. If a person fails to comply with a subpoena issued under this section, the party requesting the subpoena may refer the matter to the Attorney General for enforcement in appropriate proceedings under 42 U.S.C. 3614(c).
