Sec. 1610.4-1 through 1610.4-9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The inventory data shall be analyzed to determine whether there  are areas containing resources, values, systems or processes or hazards  eligible for further consideration for designation as an ACEC. In order  to be a potential ACEC, both of the following criteria shall be met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relevance. There shall be present a significant historic,  cultural, or scenic value; a fish or wildlife resource or   other natural system or process; or natural hazard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Importance. The above described value, resource, system,  process, or hazard shall have substantial significance and values. This  generally requires qualities of more than local significance and special  worth, consequence, meaning, distinctiveness, or cause for concern. A  natural hazard can be important if it is a significant threat to human  life or property.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State Director, upon approval of a draft resource management  plan, plan revision, or plan amendment involving ACECs, shall publish a  notice in the Federal Register listing each ACEC proposed and specifying  the resource use limitations, if any, which would occur if it were  formally designated. The notice shall provide a 60-day period for public  comment on the proposed ACEC designation. The approval of a resource  management plan, plan revision, or plan amendment constitutes formal  designation of any ACEC involved. The approved plan shall include the  general management practices and uses, including mitigating measures,  identified to protect designated ACEC.</p>
