                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How much of the administrative funds must State agencies provide to local agencies for their use? The State agency must provide to local agencies for their use all administrative funds it receives, except that the State agency may retain for its own use the amount determined by the following formula:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 15 percent of the first $50,000 received;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 10 percent of the next $100,000 received;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 5 percent of the next $250,000 received; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A maximum of $30,000, if the administrative grant exceeds $400,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> May a State agency request to retain more than the amount determined by the above formula in the event of special needs? Yes, the State agency may request approval from FNS to retain a larger amount than is allowed under the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. However, in making its request, the State agency must provide justification of the need for the larger amount at the State level, and must ensure that local agencies will not suffer undue hardship as a result of a reduction in administrative funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How must the State agency distribute funds among local agencies? The State agency must distribute funds among local agencies on the basis of their respective needs, and in a manner that ensures the funds will be used to achieve program objectives.
