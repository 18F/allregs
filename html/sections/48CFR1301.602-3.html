It is the policy of DOC that all acquisitions  are to be made only by Government officials having authority to make  such acquisitions. Acquisitions made by other than authorized personnel  are contrary to Departmental policy and the Department is not bound by  any formal or informal type of agreement or contractual commitment which  is made by persons who are not delegated contracting authority. Payment  for goods or services accepted in the absence of an authorized  commitment may be made only through the ratification process.  Unauthorized commitments may be considered matters of serious misconduct  and may subject the responsible employees to appropriate disciplinary  actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The delegation of the ratification authority is set forth in CAM  1301.70. All requests for ratification must fully explain the  circumstances that gave rise to the unauthorized commitment and detail,  if appropriate, any disciplinary action taken with respect to any  responsible employee. Ratifications may be approved only if all criteria  in FAR 1.602-3 have been met.</p>
