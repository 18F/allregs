The enforceable mechanism for  this revised State Plan is a State rule codified in 326 Indiana  Administrative Code (IAC) 11-6. The rule was adopted on August 3, 2011,  and became effective on October 28, 2011. A typographical correction was  submitted to the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board and accepted on  December 6, 2011 and became effective on January 20, 2012.  [77 FR 24407, Apr. 24, 2012]</p>
