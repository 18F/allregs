                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each cargo tank certified after October 1, 2004 must have a corrosion-resistant metal name plate (ASME Plate) and specification plate permanently attached to the cargo tank by brazing, welding, or other suitable means on the left side near the front, in a place accessible for inspection. If the specification plate is attached directly to the cargo tank wall by welding, it must be welded to the tank before the cargo tank is postweld heat treated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plates must be legibly marked by stamping, embossing, or other means of forming letters into the metal of the plate, with the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in addition to that required by Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), in characters at least \3/16\ inch high (parenthetical abbreviations may be used). All plates must be maintained in a legible condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each insulated cargo tank must have additional plates, as described, attached to the jacket in the location specified unless the specification plate is attached to the chassis and has the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The information required for both the name and specification plate may be displayed on a single plate. If the information required by this section is displayed on a plate required by Section VIII of the ASME Code, the information need not be repeated on the name and specification plates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The specification plate may be attached to the cargo tank motor vehicle chassis rail by brazing, welding, or other suitable means on the left side near the front head, in a place accessible for inspection. If the specification plate is attached to the chassis rail, then the cargo tank serial number assigned by the cargo tank manufacturer must be included on the plate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Name plate. The following information must be marked on the name plate in accordance with this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOT-specification number MC 338 (DOT MC 338).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Original test date (Orig, Test Date).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> MAWP in psig.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cargo tank test pressure (Test P), in psig.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cargo tank design temperature (Design Temp.
