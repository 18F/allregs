The reasonableness of an  interest rate will be determined with respect to current average yields  on outstanding obligations of the United States with remaining periods  of maturity comparable to the term of the loan sought to be guaranteed.  The Board may reject an application to guarantee a loan if it determines  the interest rate of such loan to be unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The performance of all of the Borrower's obligations under  the Loan Documents shall be secured by, and shall have the priority in,  such Security as provided for within the terms and conditions of the  Guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Without limiting the Lender's or Borrower's obligations under  paragraph (c) of this section, at a minimum, the loan shall be secured  by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A fully perfected and enforceable security interest and or lien,  with first   priority over conflicting security interests or other liens in all  property acquired, improved, or derived from the loan funds; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A fully perfected and enforceable security interest and or lien  in any other property of the Borrower's pledged to secure the loan,  including accessions, replacements, proceeds, or property given by a  third party as Security for the loan, the priority of which shall be, at  a minimum, equal in status with the existing highest voluntarily granted  or acquired interest or lien;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The entire loan will be secured by the same Security with equal  lien priority for the guaranteed and the unguaranteed portions of the  loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will neither be paid first  nor given any preference over the guaranteed portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An Applicant's compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section  does not assure a finding of reasonable assurance of repayment, or  assure the Board's Guarantee of the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An eligible Lender may assess and collect from the Borrower such  other fees and costs associated with the application and origination of  the loan as are reasonable and customary, taking into consideration the  amount and complexity of the credit.
