of any HUD records unless disclosure is clearly not appropriate under FOIA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The FOIA Office of the Office of the Executive Secretariat in the Office of Administration in HUD Headquarters and the FOIA liaisons in each HUD Field Office may deny a request for a record in accordance with the provisions of FOIA and this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What type of response will I receive?
