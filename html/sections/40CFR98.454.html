                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For calendar year 2011 monitoring, you may follow the provisions  of Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through (d)(2) for best available monitoring methods  rather than follow the monitoring requirements of this section. For  purposes of this subpart, any reference in Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through  (d)(2) to 2010 means 2011, March 31 means June 30, and April 1 means  July 1. Any reference to the effective date in Sec. 98.3(d)(1) through  (d)(2) means February 28, 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ensure that all the quantities required by the equations of this  subpart have been measured using either flowmeters with an accuracy and  precision of 1 percent of full scale or better or  scales with an accuracy and precision of 1 percent  of the filled weight (gas plus tare) of the containers of SF6  or PFCs that are typically weighed on the scale. For scales that are  generally used to weigh cylinders containing 115 pounds of gas when  full, this equates to 1 percent of the sum of 115  pounds and approximately 120 pounds tare, or slightly more than 2 pounds. Account for the tare weights of the  containers. You may accept gas masses or weights provided by the gas  supplier e.g., for the contents of cylinders containing new gas or for  the heels remaining in cylinders returned to the gas supplier) if the  supplier provides documentation verifying that accuracy standards are  met; however, you remain responsible for the accuracy of these masses  and weights under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All flow meters, weigh scales, and combinations of volumetric  and density measures that are used to measure or calculate quantities  under this subpart must be calibrated using calibration procedures  specified by the flowmeter, scale, volumetric or density measure  equipment manufacturer. Calibration must be performed prior to the first  reporting year. After the initial calibration, recalibration must be  performed at the minimum frequency specified by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of Equations SS-5 of this subpart, the emission  factor for the valve-hose combination (EFC) must be estimated  using measurements and/or engineering assessments or calculations based  on chemical engineering principles or physical or chemical laws or  properties. Such assessments or calculations may be based on, as  applicable, the internal volume of hose or line that is open to the  atmosphere during coupling and decoupling activities, the internal  pressure of the hose or line, the time the hose or line is open to the  atmosphere during coupling and decoupling activities, the frequency with  which the hose or line is purged and the flow rate during purges. You  must develop a value for EFc (or use an industry-developed  value) for each combination of hose and valve fitting, to use in  Equation SS-5 of this subpart. The value for EFC must be  determined for each combination of hose and valve fitting of a given  diameter or size. The calculation must be recalculated annually to  account for changes to the specifications of the valves or hoses that  may occur throughout the year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Electrical equipment manufacturers and refurbishers must account  for SF6 or PFC emissions that occur as a result of unexpected  events or accidental losses, such as a malfunctioning hose or leak in  the flow line, during the filling of equipment or containers for  disbursement by including these losses in the estimated mass of  SF6 or the   PFC emitted downstream of the container or flowmeter during the period  p.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the mass of SF6 or the PFC disbursed to customers  in new equipment over the period p is determined by assuming that it is  equal to the equipment's nameplate capacity or, in cases where equipment  is shipped with a partial charge, equal to its partial shipping charge,  equipment samples for conducting the nameplate capacity tests must be  selected using the following stratified sampling strategy in this  paragraph. For each make and model, group the measurement conditions to  reflect predictable variability in the facility's filling practices and  conditions (e.g., temperatures at which equipment is filled). Then,  independently select equipment samples at random from each make and  model under each group of conditions. To account for variability, a  certain number of these measurements must be performed to develop a  robust and representative average nameplate capacity (or shipping  charge) for each make, model, and group of conditions. A Student T  distribution calculation should be conducted to determine how many  samples are needed for each make, model, and group of conditions as a  function of the relative standard deviation of the sample measurements.  To determine a sufficiently precise estimate of the nameplate capacity,  the number of measurements required must be calculated to achieve a  precision of one percent of the true mean, using a 95 percent confidence  interval. To estimate the nameplate capacity for a given make and model,  you must use the lowest mean value among the different groups of  conditions, or provide justification for the use of a different mean  value for the group of conditions that represents the typical practices  and conditions for that make and model. Measurements can be conducted  using SF6, another gas, or a liquid. Re-measurement of  nameplate capacities should be conducted every five years to reflect  cumulative changes in manufacturing methods and conditions over time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ensure the following QA/QC methods are employed throughout the  year:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedures are in place and followed to track and weigh all  cylinders or other containers at the beginning and end of the year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> You must adhere to the following QA/QC methods for reviewing the  completeness and accuracy of reporting:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review inputs to Equation SS-1 of this subpart to ensure inputs  and outputs to the company's system are included.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not enter negative inputs and confirm that negative emissions  are not calculated. However, the decrease in SF6 inventory  may be calculated as negative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that beginning-of-year inventory matches end-of-year  inventory from the previous year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ensure that in addition to SF6 purchased from bulk  gas distributors, SF6 returned from equipment users with or  inside equipment and SF6 returned from off-site recycling are  also accounted for among the total additions.</p>
