                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An ad hoc committee, Committee on the Veterinary Medical and  Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics, was   formed by the Food and Drug Administration to study, and advise the  Commissioner on, the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for  various nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the safety and  effectiveness of such substances. A copy of the report may be obtained  from the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Room  15-05, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> On the basis of the report of the Committee and other  information, sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for  use in food-producing animals shall submit data for determining whether  or not such antibiotics and their metabolites are present as residues in  edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals; however, in the  case of a drug for which such data have already been submitted and for  which a regulation has been promulgated under section 409 of the act,  only such data as has been accumulated since the issuance of the  regulation need be submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The required data shall be submitted within 180 days of the date  of publication of this section in the Federal Register; except that in  the case of data on intramammary infusion preparations the data shall be  submitted within 60 days of such publication. Data demonstrating the  absence in milk of residues of intramammary infusion preparations when  used as directed in their labeling are needed within the 60-day period  because of the importance of milk in the human diet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Regulatory proceedings including revocation of prior sanctions,  or actions to suspend or amend new drug or antibiotic approvals granted  prior to passage of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (72 Stat.  1784), may be initiated with regard to the continued marketing of any  antibiotic preparation on which the required information is not  submitted within the period of time prescribed by paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Questions relating to the acceptability of proposed research  protocols and assay methods for determining the amount of antibiotic  residues in food should be directed to the Director, Center for  Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl.,  Rockville, MD 20855.
