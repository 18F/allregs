                            <p class="depth0">Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or  operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas  or vapor service. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section,  the owner or operator must also comply with the requirements specified  in paragraph (c) of this section for all pressure relief devices in  organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Operating requirements. Except during a pressure release event,  operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service  with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as  described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this section following a pressure  release, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a  rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as described in Method 21  of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, no later than 5 calendar days after the  pressure relief device returns to organic HAP service following a  pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating  with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, except  as provided in Sec.  63.1024(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the pressure relief device consists of or includes a rupture  disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure  release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release,  except as provided in Sec.  63.1024(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and (2) of this section for all pressure relief  devices in organic HAP service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must equip each pressure relief device in  organic HAP service with a device(s) or parameter monitoring system that  is capable of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identifying the pressure release;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is  occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the  pressure relief device itself or may be associated with the process  system or piping sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the  atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but  are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion  detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure  monitor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any pressure relief device in organic HAP service releases to  atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, the owner or  operator must calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each  pressure release event and report this quantity as required in Sec.   63.1417(f)(13)(iii). Calculations may be based on data from the pressure  relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter  monitoring data and process knowledge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pressure relief devices routed to a control device, process,  fuel gas system, or drain system. If a pressure relief device in organic  HAP service is designed and operated to route all HAP emissions from  pressure releases through a closed vent system to a control device or to  a process, fuel gas system, or drain system, the owner or operator is  not required to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) (if applicable)  of this section for that pressure relief device. The fuel gas system or  closed vent system and control device (if applicable) must meet the  requirements of Sec.  63.1034, as applicable (except that the term  ``pressure relief devices'' shall apply instead of the term ``equipment  leaks'' in Sec.  63.1034). The drain system (if applicable) must meet  the requirements of Sec.  63.136. [79 FR 60930, Oct. 8, 2014]</p>
