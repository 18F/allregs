References in the specifications to equipment, material,  articles, or patented processes by trade name, make, or catalog number,  shall be regarded as establishing a standard of quality and shall not be  construed as limiting competition. The Contractor may, at its option,  use any equipment, material, article, or process that, in the judgment  of the Contracting Officer, is equal to that named in the  specifications, unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's approval  of the machinery and mechanical and other equipment to be incorporated  into the work. When requesting approval, the Contractor shall furnish to  the Contracting Officer the name of the manufacturer, the model number,  and other information concerning the performance, capacity, nature, and  rating of the machinery and mechanical and other equipment. When  required by this contract or by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor  shall also obtain the Contracting Officer's approval of the material or  articles which the Contractor contemplates incorporating into the work.  When requesting approval, the Contractor shall provide full information  concerning the material or articles. When directed to do so, the  Contractor shall submit samples for approval at the Contractor's  expense, with all shipping charges prepaid. Machinery, equipment,  material, and articles that do not have the required approval shall be  installed or used at the risk of subsequent rejection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All work under this contract shall be performed in a skillful  and workmanlike manner. The Contracting Officer may require, in writing,  that the Contractor remove from the work any employee the Contracting  Officer deems incompetent, careless, or otherwise objectionable.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)  [48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 48995, Nov. 28, 1989]</p>
