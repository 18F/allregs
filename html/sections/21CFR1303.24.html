time his quota for that year was determined. At any time the inventory of a basic class held by a manufacturer exceeds 65 percent of his estimated net disposal, his quota for that class is automatically suspended and shall remain suspended until his inventory is less than 60 percent of his estimated net disposal. The Administrator may, upon application and for good cause shown, permit a manufacturer whose quota is, or is likely to be, suspended pursuant to this paragraph to continue manufacturing and to accumulate an inventory in excess of 65 percent of his estimated net disposal, upon such conditions and within such limitations as the Administrator may find necessary or desirable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, during a calendar year, a registrant has manufactured the entire quantity of a basic class allocated to him under an individual manufacturing quota, and his inventory of that class is less than 40 percent of his estimated net disposal of that class for that year, the Administrator may, upon application pursuant to Sec. 1303.25, increase the quota of such registrant sufficiently to allow restoration of the inventory to 50 percent of the estimated net disposal for that year.
