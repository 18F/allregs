Opportunity for a hearing will not be provided, however, when the State, in resolving audit findings or at another

time, has agreed that the amounts were not expended in accordance with law or the certifications. The hearing will be governed by Subpart F of this part and will be held in the State if required by statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a State refuses to repay amounts after a final decision that is not subject to further review in the Department, the amounts may be offset against payments to the State. If a statute requires an opportunity for a hearing before such an offset may be made, the hearing will be governed by Subpart F of this part and will be held in the State if required by statute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department will withhold funds from a State only if the Department has provided the State an opportunity for a hearing. The hearing will be governed by subpart F of this part and will be held in the State if required by statute.
