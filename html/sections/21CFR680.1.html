                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Allergenic Products are products that are administered to man for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of allergies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Source materials--(1) Criteria for source material. Only specifically identified allergenic source materials that contain no more than a total of 1.0 percent of detectable foreign materials shall be used in the manufacture of Allergenic Products, except that this requirement shall not apply to molds and animals described under paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section, respectively. Source materials such as pelts, feathers, hairs, and danders shall be collected in a manner that will minimize contamination of the source material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria for source material. Only specifically identified allergenic source materials that contain no more than a total of 1.0 percent of detectable foreign materials shall be used in the manufacture of Allergenic Products, except that this requirement shall not apply to molds and animals described under paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section, respectively. Source materials such as pelts, feathers, hairs, and danders shall be collected in a manner that will minimize contamination of the source material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Molds. (i) Molds (excluding rusts and smuts) used as source material in the manufacture of Allergenic Products shall meet the requirements of Sec. 610.18 of this chapter and Sec. 680.2 (a) and (b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Molds (excluding rusts and smuts) used as source material in the manufacture of Allergenic Products shall meet the requirements of Sec. 610.18 of this chapter and Sec. 680.2 (a) and (b).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mold cultures shall be free of contaminating materials (including microorganisms) prior to harvest, and care shall be taken to minimize contamination during harvest and subsequent processing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Mold manufacturers shall maintain written standard operating procedures, developed by a qualified individual, that will ensure the identity of the seed culture, prescribe adequate processing of the mold, and specify the acceptable limits and kinds of contamination. These limits shall be based on results of appropriate tests performed by the manufacturer on at least three consecutive lots of a mold that is a representative species of mold subject to the standard operating procedures. The tests shall be performed at each manufacturing step during and subsequent to harvest, as specified in the standard operating procedures. Before use of the mold as a source material for Allergenic Products, in accordance with 21 CFR 601.2, the standard operating procedures and test data from the three representative lots described above shall be submitted to and approved by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (see mailing addresses in Sec. 600.2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mammals and birds--(i) Care of animals. Animals intended as a source material for Allergenic Products shall be maintained by competent personnel in facilities or designated areas that will ensure adequate care. Competent veterinary care shall be provided as needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Care of animals. Animals intended as a source material for Allergenic Products shall be maintained by competent personnel in facilities or designated areas that will ensure adequate care. Competent veterinary care shall be provided as needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Health of animals. Only animals in good health and free from detectable skin diseases shall be used as a source material for Allergenic Products. The determination of good health prior to collection of the source material shall be made by a licensed veterinarian or a competent individual under the supervision and instruction of a licensed veterinarian provided that the licensed veterinarian certifies in writing that the individual is capable of determining the good health of the animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Immunization against tetanus. Animals of the equine genus intended as a source material for Allergenic Products shall be treated to maintain immunity to tetanus.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Reporting of certain diseases. In cases of actual or suspected infection with foot and mouth disease, glanders, tetanus, anthrax, gas gangrene, equine infectious anemia, equine encephalomyelitis, or any of the pock diseases among animals intended for use or used as source material in the manufacture of allergenic Products, the manufacturer shall immediately notify the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (see mailing addresses in Sec. 600.2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Dead animals. Dead animals may be used as source material in the manufacture of Allergenic Products: Provided, That (a) the carcasses shall be frozen or kept cold until the allergen can be collected, or shall be stored under other acceptable conditions so that the postmortal decomposition processes do not adversely affect the allergen, and (b) when alive, the animal met the applicable requirements prescribed in paragraphs (b)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Mammals and birds inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Mammals and birds, subject to inspection by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the time of slaughter and found suitable as food, may be used as a source material, and the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section do not apply in such a case. Notwithstanding U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection, the carcasses of such inspected animals shall be frozen or kept cold until the allergen is collected, or shall be stored under other acceptable conditions so that the postmortal decomposition processes do not adversely affect the allergen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Listing of source materials and suppliers. Each licensed manufacturer shall initially list with the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (see mailing addresses in Sec. 600.2), the name and address of each of the manufacturer's source material suppliers. The listing shall identify each source material obtained from each source material supplier. The licensed manufacturers shall update the listing annually to include new source material suppliers or to delete those no longer supplying source materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exemptions. (1) Exemptions or modifications from the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section shall be made only upon written approval by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exemptions or modifications from the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section shall be made only upon written approval by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Nonlicensed source material suppliers are exempt from drug registration.
