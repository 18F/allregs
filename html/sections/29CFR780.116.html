                                Sec. 780.116  Commodities included by reference to the Agricultural
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 3(f) expressly provides that the term ``agricultural or horticultural commodities'' shall include the commodities defined as agricultural commodities in section 15(g) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1141-1141j). Section 15(g) of that Act provides: ``As used in this act, the term `agricultural commodity' includes, in addition to other agricultural commodities, crude gum (oleoresin) from a living tree, and the following products as processed by the original producers of the crude gum (oleoresin) from which derived: Gum spirits of turpentine, and gum resin, as defined in the Naval Stores Act, approved March 3, 1923'' (7 U.S.C. 91-99). As defined in the Naval Stores Act, `` `gum spirits of turpentine' means spirits of turpentine made from gum (oleoresin) from a living tree'' and `` `gum rosin' means rosin remaining after the distillation of gum spirits of turpentine.'' The production of these commodities is therefore within the definition of ``agriculture.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Since the only oleoresin included within section 15(g) of the Agricultural Marketing Act is that derived from a living tree, the production of oleoresin from stumps or any sources other than living trees is not within section 3(f). If turpentine or rosin is produced in any manner other than the processing of crude gum from living trees, as by digging up pine stumps and grinding them or by distilling the turpentine with steam from the oleoresin within or extracted from the wood, the production of the turpentine or rosin is not included in section 3(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Similarly, the production of gum turpentine or gum rosin is not included when these are produced by anyone other than the original producer of the crude gum from which they are derived. Thus, if a producer of turpentine or rosin from oleoresin from living trees makes such products not only from oleoresin produced by him but also from oleoresin delivered to him by others, he is not producing a product defined as an agricultural commodity and employees engaged in his production operations are not agricultural employees. (For an explanation of the inclusion of the word ``production'' in section 3(f), see Sec. 780.117(b).) It is to be noted, however, that the production of gum turpentine and gum rosin from crude gum (oleoresin) derived from a living tree is included within section 3(f) when performed at a central still for and on account of the producer of the crude gum. But where central stills buy the crude gum they process and are the owners of the gum turpentine and gum rosin that are derived from such crude gum and which they market for their own account, the production of such gum turpentine and gum rosin is not within section 3(f).</p><p class="depth0">``Production, Cultivation, Growing, and Harvesting'' of Commodities


Sec. 780.117  ``Production, cultivation, growing.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The words ``production, cultivation, growing'' describe actual raising operations which are normally intended or expected to produce specific agricultural or horticultural commodities. The raising of such commodities is included even though done for purely experimental purposes. The ``growing'' may take place in growing media other than soil as in the case of hydroponics. The words do not include operations undertaken or conducted for purposes not concerned with obtaining any specific agricultural or horticultural commodity. Thus operations which are merely preliminary, preparatory or incidental to the operations whereby such commodities are actually produced are not within the terms ``production, cultivation, growing''. For example, employees of a processor of vegetables who are engaged in buying vegetable plants and distributing them to farmers with whom their employer has acreage contracts are not engaged in the ``production, cultivation, growing'' of agricultural or horticultural commodities. The furnishing of mushroom spawn by a canner of mushrooms to growers who supply the canner with mushrooms grown from such spawn

does not constitute the ``growing'' of mushrooms. Similarly, employees of the employer who is engaged in servicing insecticide sprayers in the farmer's orchard and employees engaged in such operations as the testing of soil or genetics research are not included within the terms. (However, see Sec. Sec. 780.128, et seq., for possible exemption on other grounds.) The word ``production,'' used in conjunction with ``cultivation, growing, and harvesting,'' refers, in its natural and unstrained meaning, to what is derived and produced from the soil, such as any farm produce. Thus, ``production'' as used in section 3(f) does not refer to such operations as the grinding and processing of sugarcane, the milling of wheat into flour, or the making of cider from apples. These operations are clearly the processing of the agricultural commodities and not the production of them (Bowie v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The word ``production'' was added to the definition of ``agriculture'' in order to take care of a special situation--the production of turpentine and gum rosins by a process involving the tapping of living trees. (See S. Rep. No. 230, 71st Cong., second sess. (1930); H.R. Rep. No. 2738, 75th Cong., third sess. p. 29 (1938).) To insure the inclusion of this process within the definition, the word ``production'' was added to section 3(f) in conjunction with the words ``including commodities defined as agricultural commodities in section 15(g) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended'' (Bowie v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11). It is clear, therefore, that ``production'' is not used in section 3(f) in the artificial and special sense in which it is defined in section 3(j). It does not exempt an employee merely because he is engaged in a closely related process or occupation directly essential to the production of agricultural or horticultural commodities. To so construe the term would render unnecessary the remainder of what Congress clearly intended to be a very elaborate and comprehensive definition of ``agriculture.'' The legislative history of this part of the definition was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in reaching these conclusions in Farmers Reservoir Co. v. McComb, 337 U.S. 755.


Sec. 780.118  ``Harvesting.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term ``Harvesting'' as used in section 3(f) includes all operations customarily performed in connection with the removal of the crops by the farmer from their growing position (Holtville Alfalfa Mills v. Wyatt, 230 F. 2d 398; NLRB v. Olaa Sugar Co., 242 F. 2d 714). Examples include the cutting of grain, the picking of fruit, the stripping of bluegrass seed, and the digging up of shrubs and trees grown in a nursery. Employees engaged on a plantation in gathering sugarcane as soon as it has been cut, loading it, and transporting the cane to a concentration point on the farm are engaged in ``Harvesting'' (Vives v. Serralles, 145 F. 2d 552).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The combining of grain is exempt either as harvesting or as a practice performed on a farm in conjunction with or as an incident to farming operations. (See in this connection Holtville Alfalfa Mills v. Wyatt, 230 F. 2d 398.) ``Harvesting'' does not extend to operations subsequent to and unconnected with the actual process whereby agricultural or horticultural commodities are severed from their attachment to the soil or otherwise reduced to possession. For example, the processing of sugarcane into raw sugar (Bowie v. Gonzalez, 117 F. 2d 11, and see Maneja v. Waialua, 349 U.S. 254), or the vining of peas are not included. For a further discussion on vining employees, see Sec. 780.139. While transportation to a concentration point on the farm may be included, ``harvesting'' never extends to transportation or other operations off the farm. Off-the-farm transportation can only be ``agriculture'' when performed by the farmer as an incident to his farming operations (Chapman v. Durkin, 214 F. 2d 360 cert. denied 348 U.S. 897; Fort Mason Fruit Co. v. Durkin, 214 F. 2d 363 cert. denied 348 U.S. 897). For further discussion of this point, see Sec. Sec. 780.144 through 780.147; Sec. Sec. 780.152 through 780.157.</p><p class="depth0">Raising of Livestock, Bees, Fur-bearing Animals, or Poultry</p>
