For 1978, B  Corporation has earnings and profits of $225, on which it pays foreign  income taxes of $75. In 1978, B Corporation distributes $150, which,  under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.960-2, consists of $100 to which section  902(b)(1) does not apply (from B Corporation's earnings and profits  attributable to an amount required under section 951 to be included in N  Corporation's gross income with respect to B Corporation) and $50 to  which section 902(b)(1) applies (from B Corporation's other earnings and  profits). The country under the laws of which A Corporation is  incorporated imposes an income tax of 40 percent on all income but  exempts from tax dividends received from a subsidiary corporation. A  Corporation makes no distribution for 1978. Under paragraph (b) of  Sec. 1.960-2, A Corporation is deemed to have paid $25 ($50/$150x$75) of  the $75 foreign income taxes paid by B Corporation on its pretax  earnings and profits of $225.

Corporations A and B use the calendar year as the taxable year. Such  amounts are required to be included in N Corporation's gross income by  reason of its ownership of stock in A Corporation and in turn by A  Corporation's ownership of stock in B Corporation. Corporation A is a  controlled foreign corporation throughout 1977, but B Corporation is a  controlled foreign corporation only from January 1, 1977, through  September 30, 1977.

Corporation N may obtain credit under section 960(a)(1) for the year  ending June 30, 1978, for foreign income taxes paid by B Corporation for  1977, only if on September 30, 1977, N Corporation owns at least 10  percent of the voting stock of A Corporation, A Corporation owns at  least 10 percent of the voting stock of B Corporation, and the  percentage of voting stock requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this  section is met.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

A, B, and C Corporations were all controlled foreign  corporations throughout their respective taxable years ending as  follows: A Corporation, December 31, 1983; B Corporation, November 31,  1983; and C Corporation, August 31, 1983. Paragraph (c) of this section  applies to amounts included in gross income of N Corporation with  respect to the earnings and profits of A Corporation because the 10  percent ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is met  on December 31, 1983.

The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Domestic corporation N owns all the one class of stock of  controlled foreign corporation A, incorporated under the laws of foreign  country X, which owns all the one   class of stock of controlled foreign corporation B, incorporated under  the laws of foreign country Y. All such corporations use the calendar  year as the taxable year. For 1978, N Corporation is required under  section 951 to include in gross income $45 attributable to the earnings  and profits of B Corporation for such year and $50 attributable to the  earnings and profits of A Corporation for such year. For 1978, because  of the inclusion of such amounts in gross income, N Corporation is  deemed under section 960(a)(1) and paragraph (c) of this section to have  paid $15 of foreign income taxes paid by B Corporation for such year and  $10 of foreign income taxes paid by A Corporation for such year. For  purposes of section 904, the amount ($95) included in N Corporation's  gross income under section 951 attributable to the earnings and profits  of corporations A and B is deemed to be derived from sources within  country X, and the section 78 dividend consisting of the foreign income  taxes ($25) deemed paid by N Corporation under section 960(a)(1) with  respect to such $95 is deemed to be derived from sources within country  X. The $25 of foreign income taxes so deemed paid by N Corporation are  deemed to be paid to country X for purposes of section 904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Computation of deemed-paid taxes in post-1986 taxable years--(1)  General rule. If a domestic corporation is eligible to compute deemed- paid taxes under section 960(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> with respect to an amount included in  gross income under section 951(a), then, such domestic corporation shall  be deemed to have paid a portion of the foreign corporation's post-1986  foreign income taxes determined under section 902 and the regulations  under that section in the same manner as if the amount so included were  a dividend paid by such foreign corporation (determined by applying  section 902(c) in accordance with section 904(d)(3)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ordering rule for computing deemed-paid taxes under sections 902  and 960. If a domestic corporation computes deemed-paid taxes under both  sections 902 and 960 in the same taxable year, section 960 shall be  applied first. After the deemed-paid taxes are computed under section  960 with respect to a deemed income inclusion, post-1986 undistributed  earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes in each separate category  shall be reduced by the appropriate amounts before deemed-paid taxes are  computed under section 902 with respect to a dividend distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computation of post-1986 undistributed earnings. Post-1986  undistributed earnings (or an accumulated deficit in post-1986  undistributed earnings) are computed under section 902 and the  regulations under that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allocation of accumulated deficits. For purposes of computing  post-1986 undistributed earnings under sections 902 and 960, a post-1986  accumulated deficit in a separate category shall be allocated  proportionately to reduce post-1986 undistributed earnings in the other  separate categories. However, a deficit in any separate category shall  not permanently reduce earnings in other separate categories, but after  the deemed-paid taxes are computed the separate limitation deficit shall  be carried forward in the same separate category in which it was  incurred. In addition, because deemed-paid taxes may not exceed taxes  paid or accrued by the controlled foreign corporation, in computing  deemed-paid taxes with respect to an inclusion out of a separate  category that exceeds post-1986 undistributed earnings in that separate  category, the numerator of the deemed-paid credit fraction (deemed  inclusion from the separate category) may not exceed the denominator  (post-1986 undistributed earnings in the separate category).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (i) may be  illustrated by the following examples. See Sec. 1.952-1(f)(4) for  additional illustrations of these rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(1)</em> of this section, A includes 100u of passive  limitation income in gross income for 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of computing post-1986 undistributed earnings  under sections 902,   904(d) and 960 with respect to the subpart F inclusion, the shipping  limitation deficit of (50u) is allocated proportionately to reduce  general limitation earnings of 100u and passive limitation earnings of  100u. Thus, general limitation earnings are reduced by 25u to 75u (100u  general limitation earnings/200u total earnings in positive separate  categories x (50u) shipping deficit = 25u reduction), and passive  limitation earnings are reduced by 25u to 75u (100u passive earnings/ 200u total earnings in positive separate categories x (50u) shipping  deficit = 25u reduction). All of CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes  with respect to passive limitation earnings are deemed paid by A under  section 960 with respect to the 100u subpart F inclusion of passive  income (75u inclusion (numerator limited to denominator under paragraph  (i)(4) of this section)/75u passive earnings). After the inclusion and  deemed-paid taxes are computed, at the close of 1998 CFC has 100u of  general limitation earnings, 0 of passive limitation earnings (100u of  foreign personal holding company income - 100u inclusion), and a (50u)  deficit in shipping limitation earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 with the  addition of the following facts. In 1999, CFC distributes 150u to A. CFC  has 100u of previously-taxed earnings and profits described in section  959(c)(2) attributable to 1998, all of which is passive limitation  earnings and profits. Under section 959(c), 100u of the 150u  distribution is deemed to be made from earnings and profits described in  section 959(c)(2). The remaining 50u is deemed to be made from earnings  and profits described in section 959(c)(3). The entire dividend  distribution of 50u is treated as made out of CFC's general limitation  earnings and profits. See section 904(d)(3)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of computing post-1986 undistributed earnings  under section 902 with respect to the 1999 dividend of 50u, the shipping  limitation accumulated deficit of (50u) reduces general limitation  earnings and profits of 100u to 50u. Thus, 100% of CFC's post-1986  foreign income taxes with respect to general limitation earnings are  deemed paid by A under section 902 with respect to the 1999 dividend of  50u (50u dividend/50u general limitation earnings). After the deemed- paid taxes are computed, at the close of 1999 CFC has 50u of general  limitation earnings (100u opening balance--50u distribution), 0 of  passive limitation earnings, and a (50u) deficit in shipping limitation  earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (i) applies to taxable years of a  controlled foreign corporation beginning after March 3, 1997.
