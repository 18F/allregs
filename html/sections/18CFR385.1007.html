The  presiding officer may require additional information from the  participants and convene a prehearing conference for the purpose of  determining the issues to be considered at a hearing, if one is to be  held. The presiding officer may also specify the time available for oral  argument and determine the nature of the hearing to be held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The presiding officer may determine, upon request by a  participant, whether to permit the participant to raise new facts or  issues not raised in prior proceedings on the contested order. Such a  request may be granted if the facts or issues are facts or issues that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Were not known and could not, with the exercise of due care,  have been known to the participant at the time they could have been  raised in prior proceedings; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are facts or issues that the participant was not permitted to  raise in prior proceedings on the contested order due to an adverse  procedural ruling alleged to be erroneous; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The petitioner must file a request to raise new facts or issues  simultaneously with its petition for review. The Secretary must file  such a request simultaneously with its reply to the petition for review.  A third party must   make such a request by the filing deadline set by the presiding officer.
