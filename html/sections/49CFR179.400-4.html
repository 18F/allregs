(of the  cryogenic liquid)/day, means the rate of evaporation, determined by test  of a test cryogenic liquid in a tank maintained at a pressure of  approximately one atmosphere, absolute. This determination of the NER is  the NER test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stabilization period means the elapsed time after a tank car  tank is filled with the test cryogenic liquid until the NER has  stabilized, or 24 hours has passed, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Calculated heat transfer rate. The calculated heat transfer rate  (CHTR) is determined by the use of test data obtained during the NER  test in the formula:  q = [N([Delta] h)(90-tl)] / [V(8.32828)(ts- tf)]  Where:  q = CHTR, in Btu/day/lb., of water capacity; N = NER, determined by NER test, in lbs./day; [Delta]h = latent heat of vaporization of the test cryogenic liquid at</p><p class="depth3">the NER test pressure of approximately one atmosphere,</p><p class="depth3">absolute, in Btu/lb.; 90 = ambient temperature at 90 F.; V = gross water volume at 60 F. of the inner tank, in gallons; tl = equilibrium temperature of intended lading at maximum</p><p class="depth3">shipping pressure, in F.; 8.32828 = constant for converting gallons of water at 60 F. to lbs. of</p><p class="depth3">water at 60 F., in lbs./gallon; ts = average temperature of outer jacket, determined by</p><p class="depth3">averaging jacket temperatures at various locations on the</p><p class="depth3">jacket at regular intervals during the NER test, in F.; tf = equilibrium temperature of the test cryogenic liquid at</p><p class="depth3">the NER test pressure of approximately, one atmosphere,</p><p class="depth3">absolute, in F.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DOT-113A60W tank cars must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be filled with hydrogen, cryogenic liquid to the maximum  permitted fill density specified in Sec. 173.319(d)(2) table of this  subchapter prior to performing the NER test; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have a CHTR equal to or less than the SHTR specified in  Sec. 179.401-1 table for a DOT-113A60W tank car.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DOT-113C120W tank cars must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be filled with ethylene, cryogenic liquid to the maximum  permitted fill density specified in Sec. 173.319(d)(2) table of this  subchapter prior to performing the NER test, or be filled with nitrogen,  cryogenic liquid to 90 percent of the volumetric capacity of the inner  tank prior to performing the NER test; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have a CHTR equal to or less than 75 percent of the SHTR  specified in Sec. 179.401-1 table for a DOT-113C120W tank car.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Insulating materials must be approved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the insulation consists of a powder having a tendency to  settle, the entire top of the cylindrical portion of the inner tank must  be insulated with a layer of glass fiber insulation at least   one-inch nominal thickness, or equivalent, suitably held in position and  covering an area extending 25 degrees to each side of the top center  line of the inner tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The outer jacket must be provided with fittings to permit  effective evacuation of the annular space between the outer jacket and  the inner tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A device to measure the absolute pressure in the annular space  must be provided. The device must be portable with an easily accessible  connection or permanently positioned where it is readily visible to the  operator.
