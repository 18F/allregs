At a minimum, each tank car facility must  visually inspect the tank externally and internally as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An internal inspection of the tank shell and heads for abrasion,  corrosion, cracks, dents, distortions, defects in welds, or any other  condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation, and except  in the areas where insulation or a thermal protection system precludes  it, an external inspection of the tank shell and heads for abrasion,  corrosion, cracks, dents, distortions, defects in welds, or any other  condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation, and for DOT  115 class tank cars, an internal inspection of the inner container and  external inspection of the outer shell and heads for defects in welds,  or any other condition that may make the tank car unsafe for  transportation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an internal coating or lining, head protection, insulation,  or thermal protection is removed in part or in whole, the internal and  external exposed surface of the tank must be visually inspected for  defects in welds or any other condition that may make the tank car  unsafe for transportation, and this inspection must precede any  application or reapplication of a coating or lining;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An inspection of the service equipment, including gaskets, for  indications of corrosion and other conditions that may make the tank car  unsafe for transportation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An inspection for missing or loose bolts, nuts, or elements that  may make the tank car unsafe for transportation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> An inspection of all closures on the tank car for conditions  that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation, including an  inspection of the protective housings for proper condition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An inspection of excess flow valves with threaded seats for  tightness; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> An inspection of the required markings on the tank car for  legibility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Structural integrity inspections and tests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each tank car  owner must ensure the structural elements on the tank car qualify with  the applicable requirements of this subchapter. At a minimum, the  structural integrity inspection and test must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All transverse fillet welds greater than 0.64 cm (0.25 inch)  within 121.92 cm (4 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline except  body bolster pad attachment welds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The termination of longitudinal fillet welds greater than 0.64  cm (0.25 inch) within 121.92 cm (4 feet) of the bottom longitudinal  centerline; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The tank shell butt welds within 60.96 cm (2 feet) of the  bottom longitudinal centerline, unless the tank car owner can determine  by analysis (e.g., finite element analysis, damage-tolerance analysis,  or service reliability assessment) that the structure will not develop  defects that reduce the design level of safety and reliability or fail  within its operational life or prior to the next required inspection.  The owner must maintain all documentation used to make such  determination at its principal place of business and make the data  available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For DOT 115 class tanks, paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of  this section apply only to the outer shell fillet welds and to the non- reinforced exposed outer shell butt welds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The inspection requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this  section do not apply to reinforced tank shell butt welds until the time  of lining removal or application for tank cars with an internal lead,  glass, or rubber lining.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each tank car facility must inspect and test the elements  identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by one or more of the  following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dye penetrant testing (PT);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Radiographic examination (RT);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Magnetic particle testing (MT);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ultrasonic testing (UT); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Direct, remote, or enhanced visual inspection, using, for  example, magnifiers, fiberscopes, borescopes, and/or machine vision  technology (VT).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Thickness tests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tank car owner must ensure that each  tank car facility measures the thickness of the tank car shell, heads,  sumps, protective housing (i.e., domes), and nozzles on each tank car by  using a device capable of accurately measuring the thickness to within  [0.05 mm ([0.002 inch).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car has a  thickness test measurement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the time of an internal coating or lining application or  replacement, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At least once every ten (10) years for a tank that does not  have an internal coating or lining, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> At least once every five (5) years for a tank that does not  have an internal coating or lining when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The tank is used to transport a material that is corrosive or  reactive to the tank (see Appendix D of this part) or service equipment  as defined Sec. 180.503, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The remaining shell and head thickness is tested and determined  to be at or below line C in Figure A of this paragraph.

The thickness  test applies only to the non-lined or coated repaired area, and is not a  qualification event. Modification of the tank stencil is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Operation of a tank car below the condemning limit for general  corrosion or the condemning limit for localized corrosion (as shown in  Figure A of this section) is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For sumps, protective housing (i.e., domes), nozzles, and nozzle  reinforcing pads, the tank car owner must determine if any reduction in  wall thickness affects the design levels of reliability and safety built  into sump, protective housing, nozzle, or nozzle reinforcement. Each  tank car owner must maintain at its principal place of business  documentation describing the allowable thickness reductions for sumps,  protective housings, and nozzles, and nozzle reinforcements. This  documentation must be made available to FRA or an authorized  representative of the Department upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> After repairs, alterations, conversions, modifications, or  blasting of tank car that results in a reduction of the tank's  thickness, and anytime a tank car coating or lining is removed, a  qualified individual must measure the thickness of the tank in the area  of reduced thickness to ensure that the thickness of the tank conforms  to paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Service life thickness allowance. (1) A tank car found with a  thickness below the required minimum thickness after forming for its  specification, as stated in part 179 of this subchapter, may continue in  service if any reduction in the required minimum thickness is not more  than that provided in the following table:</p><p class="depth0">Allowable Shell Thickness Reductions ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Top shell and tank</p><p class="depth0">Marked tank test pressure            head            Bottom shell ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 60 psig <200 psig...............  3.17 mm...........  1.58 mm.</p><p class="depth0">\1/8\ inch........  \1/16\ inch. =200 psig............  0.79 mm...........  0.79 mm.</p><p class="depth0">\1/32\ inch.......  \1/32\ inch. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Note 1. A tank car owner may add an extra 1.58 mm (\1/16\ inch) to  the values in the table for local reductions. Local reductions are those  that do not exceed 20.32 linear centimeters (8 linear inches) measured  at the longest diameter, and are separated from the other local  reductions by at least 40.64 cm (16 inches).</p><p class="depth0">Note 2. Any reduction in the tank car shell thickness may not affect  the structural strength of the tank car to the extent that the tank car  no longer conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 6.2 of the  AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter).</p><p class="depth0">Note 3. For DOT 115 class tank cars, shell thickness reductions  apply only to the outer shell of the tank car. There is no shell or head  thickness reduction authorized for the inner tank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Safety system inspections. Each tank car owner must ensure  qualification of the tank car safety systems. However, inspections of  foam or cork insulation systems are not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Internal coating and lining inspection and test. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At a  minimum, the owner of an internal coating or lining applied to protect a  tank used to transport a material that is corrosive or reactive to the  tank must ensure an inspection adequate enough to detect defects or  other conditions that could reduce the design level of reliability and  safety of the tank is performed. In addition, the owner of a coating or  lining   of tank cars used to transport hazardous materials must ensure the  lining complies with Sec. 173.24(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The owner of the internal coating or lining must establish and  maintain a record of the service life of the coating or lining and  commodity combination, that is, the specific hazardous materials that  were loaded into a tank and the coating or lining in place at the time  of loading. The owner of the internal coating or lining must use its  knowledge of the service life of each coating or lining and commodity  combination to establish an appropriate inspection interval for that  coating or lining and commodity combination. This interval must not  exceed eight (8) years, unless the coating or lining owner can  establish, document, and show that the service history or scientific  analysis of the coating or lining and commodity pairing supports a  longer inspection interval. The owner must maintain at its principal  place of business a written procedure for collecting and documenting the  performance of the coating or lining applied within the tank car for its  service life. The internal coating or lining owner must provide this  documentation, including inspection and test, repair, removal, and  application procedures, to the FRA or car owner upon request. Further,  the offeror must provide commodity information to the car owner and the  owner of the internal coating or lining upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner of the internal coating or lining must provide the  test method and acceptance criteria to the tank car owner and to the  person responsible for qualifying the coating or lining. The tank car  facility inspecting and testing the internal coating or lining must  follow the inspection and test procedure, including the acceptance  requirements, established by the internal coating or lining owner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Leakage pressure test. Unless the design of the service  equipment arrangement precludes it (e.g., there is no fitting to  pressurize the tank), each owner of a tank car must ensure that the  tank, service equipment, and closures installed, replaced, or  reinstalled on the tank car are leak tested. The test may be conducted  with the lading in the tank. When the test pressure exceeds the start- to-discharge or burst pressure of a pressure relief device, the device  must be rendered inoperative. The written procedures and test method for  leak testing must ensure the sensitivity and reliability of the test  method to prevent premature failure. This section does not apply to  facilities that remove closures for the sole purpose of loading or  unloading the lading (e.g., blind flanges, pipe plugs, etc.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Service equipment inspection and test. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each tank car owner  must ensure the qualification of tank car service equipment at least  once every ten (10) years. The tank car owner must analyze the service  equipment inspection and test results for any given lading and, based on  the analysis, adjust the inspection and test frequency to ensure that  the design level of reliability and safety of the equipment is met. The  owner must maintain at its principal place of business all supporting  documentation used to make such analyses and inspection and test  frequency adjustments. The supporting documentation must be made  available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each tank car facility must qualify service equipment, including  reclosing pressure relief devices and interior heater systems in  accordance with the applicable provisions of Appendix D of the AAR  Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Alternative inspection and test procedures. When approved by the  Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety, FRA, a tank car owner, or a  coating or lining owner may use an alternative inspection and test  procedure or interval based on a damage-tolerance analysis (that must  include a determination of the probable locations and modes of damage  due to fatigue, corrosion, and accidental damage), or based on a service  reliability assessment (that must be supported by analysis of  systematically collected data) in lieu of the other requirements of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Inspection and test compliance date for tank cars. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After  July 1, 2000, each tank car with a metal jacket or with a thermal  protection system shall have   an inspection and test conforming to this section no later than the date  the tank car requires a periodic hydrostatic pressure test (i.e., the  marked due date on the tank car for the hydrostatic test).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After July 1, 1998, each tank car without a metal jacket shall  have an inspection and test conforming to this section no later than the  date the tank car requires a periodic hydrostatic pressure test (i.e.,  the marked due date on the tank car for the hydrostatic test).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For tank cars on a 20-year periodic hydrostatic pressure test  interval (i.e., Class DOT 103W, 104W, 111A60W1, 111A100W1, and 111A100W3  tank cars), the next inspection and test date is the midpoint between  the compliance date in paragraph (l)(1) or (2) of this section and the  remaining years until the tank would have had a hydrostatic pressure  test.
