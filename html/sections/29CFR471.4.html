The ``Secretary's notice'' shall consist of the following:</p><p class="depth3">``Employee Rights Under The National Labor Relations Act''</p><p class="depth3">``The NLRA guarantees the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively with their employers, and to engage in other protected concerted activity. Employees covered by the NLRA* are protected from certain types of employer and union misconduct. This Notice gives you general information about your rights, and about the obligations of employers and unions under the NLRA. Contact the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal agency that investigates and resolves complaints under the NLRA, using the contact information supplied below, if you have any questions about specific rights that may apply in your particular workplace.</p><p class="depth3">``Under the NLRA, you have the right to:</p><p class="depth3">Organize a union to negotiate with your employer concerning your wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.</p><p class="depth3">Form, join or assist a union.</p><p class="depth3">Bargain collectively through representatives of employees' own choosing for a contract with your employer setting your wages, benefits, hours, and other working conditions.</p><p class="depth3">Discuss your terms and conditions of employment or union organizing with your co-workers or a union.</p><p class="depth3">Take action with one or more co-workers to improve your working conditions by, among other means, raising work-related complaints directly with your employer or with a government agency, and seeking help from a union.</p><p class="depth3">Strike and picket, depending on the purpose or means of the strike or the picketing.</p><p class="depth3">Choose not to do any of these activities, including joining or remaining a member of a union.</p><p class="depth3">``Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your employer to:</p><p class="depth3">Prohibit you from soliciting for a union during non-work time, such as before or after work or during break times; or from distributing union literature during non-work time, in non-work areas, such as parking lots or break rooms.</p><p class="depth3">Question you about your union support or activities in a manner that discourages you from engaging in that activity.</p><p class="depth3">Fire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce your hours or change your shift, or otherwise take adverse action against you, or threaten to take any of these actions, because you join or support a union, or because you engage in concerted activity for mutual aid and protection, or because you choose not to engage in any such activity.</p><p class="depth3">Threaten to close your workplace if workers choose a union to represent them.</p><p class="depth3">Promise or grant promotions, pay raises, or other benefits to discourage or encourage union support.</p><p class="depth3">Prohibit you from wearing union hats, buttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace except under special circumstances.</p><p class="depth3">Spy on or videotape peaceful union activities and gatherings or pretend to do so.</p><p class="depth3">``Under the NLRA, it is illegal for a union or for the union that represents you in bargaining with your employer to:</p><p class="depth3">Threaten you that you will lose your job unless you support the union.</p><p class="depth3">Refuse to process a grievance because you have criticized union officials or because you are not a member of the union.</p><p class="depth3">Use or maintain discriminatory standards or procedures in making job referrals from a hiring hall.</p><p class="depth3">Cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against you because of your union-related activity.</p><p class="depth3">Take other adverse action against you based on whether you have joined or support the union.</p><p class="depth3">``If you and your coworkers select a union to act as your collective bargaining representative, your employer and the union are required to bargain in good faith in a genuine effort to reach a written, binding agreement setting your terms and conditions of employment.

represent you in bargaining and enforcing the agreement.</p><p class="depth3">``Illegal conduct will not be permitted. If you believe your rights or the rights of others have been violated, you should contact the NLRB promptly to protect your rights, generally within six months of the unlawful activity. You may inquire about possible violations without your employer or anyone else being informed of the inquiry. Charges may be filed by any person and need not be filed by the employee directly affected by the violation. The NLRB may order an employer to rehire a worker fired in violation of the law and to pay lost wages and benefits, and may order an employer or union to cease violating the law. Employees should seek assistance from the nearest regional NLRB office, which can be found on the Agency's Web site: http://www.nlrb.gov. ``Click on the NLRB's page titled ``About Us,'' which contains a link, ``Locating Our Offices.''

Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in Executive Order 13496 of January 30, 2009, or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.</p><p class="depth3">``4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) herein in every subcontract or purchase order entered into in connection with this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to Section 3 of Executive Order 13496 of January 30, 2009), so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: Provided, however, if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.''</p>
