An employer shall be  liable for 20-year-limitation amounts to the extent provided in section  4219(c)(1)(D) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liability for reallocation liability. An employer shall be  liable for reallocation liability if the employer withdrew pursuant to  an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from a multiemployer plan from  which substantially all employers withdrew pursuant to an agreement or  arrangement to withdraw, or if the employer withdrew after the beginning  of the second full plan year preceding the termination date from a plan  that terminated by the withdrawal of every employer, and, as of the  reallocation record date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer has not been completely liquidated or dissolved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employer is not the subject of a case or proceeding under  title 11, United States Code, or any case or proceeding under similar  provisions of state insolvency laws, except that a plan sponsor may  determine that such an employer is liable for reallocation liability if  the plan sponsor determines that the employer is reasonably expected to  be able to pay its initial withdrawal liability and its redetermination  liability in full and on time to the plan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The plan sponsor has not determined that the employer's initial  withdrawal liability or its redetermination liability is limited by  section 4225 of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> General exclusion. In the event that a plan experiences  successive mass withdrawals, an employer that has been determined to be  liable under this subpart for any component of mass withdrawal liability  shall not be liable as a result of the same withdrawal for that  component of mass withdrawal liability with respect to a subsequent mass  withdrawal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Free-look rule. An employer that is not liable for initial  withdrawal liability pursuant to a plan amendment adopting section  4210(a) of ERISA shall not be liable for de minimis amounts or for 20- year-limitation amounts, but shall be liable for reallocation liability  in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment of initial withdrawal liability. An employer's payment  of its total initial withdrawal liability, whether by prepayment or  otherwise, for a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a  mass withdrawal shall not exclude the employer from or otherwise limit  the employer's mass withdrawal liability under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agreement presumed. Withdrawal by an employer during a period of  three consecutive plan years within which substantially all employers  withdraw from a plan shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an  agreement or arrangement to withdraw unless the employer proves  otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
