(1) A sample of each thickness submitted shall be tested for smoke emission. Each sample shall be laid on a \1/4\ x 12 x 27 steel plate. Normal protective coatings and deck attachments shall be incorporated in the samples. Each sample shall be heated in a furnace whose temperature is limited to the standard decking curve reaching 1,325 degrees F. at the end of one hour. Smoke observations shall be made at intervals not greater than five minutes during the one-hour period of test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sample of each thickness submitted shall be tested for smoke emission.

A plot of light transmission values shall be made using straight lines between instantaneous values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any instantaneous value of 10 percent light transmission or less shall be considered sufficient cause for rejection of a deck covering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Average values of light transmission shall be calculated for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Averages shall be an arithmetic mean with values taken at one minute intervals from the plotted curve noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If any of the three average values of light transmission is less than the values set forth below, it will be considered sufficient cause for rejection of a deck covering:
15 minutes--90 percent light transmission.30 minutes--60 percent light transmission.60 minutes--50 percent light transmission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fire resistance and integrity tests. (1) A sample of each thickness submitted shall be tested for fire resistance and integrity. Each sample shall be laid on a \1/4\ x 12 x 27 steel plate. Normal protective coatings and deck attachments shall be incorporated in the samples. Each sample shall be heated in a furnace whose temperature is controlled according to the standard fire exposure curve reaching 1,700 degrees F. at the end of one hour. Temperature of the unexposed side as indicated by a thermocouple under a 0.40 inch asbestos pad shall be observed at intervals not greater than 5 minutes during the one-hour period of test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A sample of each thickness submitted shall be tested for fire resistance and integrity.

(1) Deck coverings are not inspected at regularly scheduled factory inspections; however, the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may detail a marine inspector at any time to visit any place where deck coverings are manufactured to conduct any inspections or examinations deemed advisable and to select representative samples for further examination, inspection or tests. The marine inspector shall be admitted to any place where work is done on deck coverings or component materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deck coverings are not inspected at regularly scheduled factory inspections; however, the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, may detail a marine inspector at any time to visit any place where deck coverings are manufactured to conduct any inspections or examinations deemed advisable and to select representative samples for further examination, inspection or tests.

The manufacturer will incur no expense for such tests, but the results shall be binding upon the approval of his product. The manufacturer will be advised in advance of the time of testing of the samples selected and may witness the tests if he so desires.
