The schedule includes duties required by this part, subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code as well as certain practical suggestions, but it is only intended to highlight the more significant duties and is not an exhaustive description of all the trustee's responsibilities. It also

assumes that the commodity broker being liquidated is an FCM. Moreover, it is important to note that the operating facts in a particular bankruptcy proceeding may vary the schedule or obviate the need for any of the particular activities.</p><p class="depth0">All Cases</p><p class="depth0">Date of Order for Relief</p><p class="depth0">1. Assure that the commodity broker has notified the Commission, its designated self-regulatory organization (``DSRO'') (if any), and all applicable clearing organizations of which it is a member that a petition or order for relief has been filed (Sec. 190.02(a)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">2. Attempt to effectuate the transfer of entire customer accounts wherein the commodity contracts are transferred together with the money, securities, or other property margining, guaranteeing, or securing the commodity contracts (hereinafter the ``transfer'').</p><p class="depth0">3. Attempt to estimate shortfall of customer funds segregated pursuant to sections 4d(a) and (b) of the Act; customer funds segregated pursuant to section 4f of the Act; and the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, as defined in Sec. 1.3 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">a. The trustee should:</p><p class="depth0">i. Contact the DSRO (if any) and the clearing organizations and attempt to effectuate a transfer with such shortfall under section 764(b) of the Code; notify the Commission for assistance (Sec. 190.02(a)(2) and (e)(1), Sec. 190.06(b)(2), (e), (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h)) but recognize that if there is a substantial shortfall, a transfer of such funds or amounts is highly unlikely.</p><p class="depth0">ii. If a transfer cannot be effectuated, liquidate all customer commodity contracts that are margined, guaranteed, or secured by funds or amounts with such shortfall, except dealer options and specifically identifiable commodity contracts which are bona fide hedging positions (as defined in Sec. 190.01(kk)(2)) with instructions not to be liquidated. (See Sec. Sec. 190.02(f) and 190.06(d)(1)). (In this connection, depending upon the size of the debtor and other complications of liquidation, the trustee should be aware of special liquidation rules, and in particular the availability under certain circumstances of book-entry liquidation (Sec. 190.04(d)(1)(ii)).</p><p class="depth0">b. If there is a small shortfall in any of the funds or amounts listed in paragraph 2, negotiate with the clearing organization to effect a transfer; notify the Commission (Sec. Sec. 190.02(a)(2) and (e)(1), 190.06(b)(2), (e), (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h)).</p><p class="depth0">4.

Offset all futures contracts and Cleared Swaps contracts which cannot be settled in cash and which would otherwise remain open either beyond the last day of trading (if applicable) or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver may be tendered with respect thereto, whichever occurs first; offset all long options on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash, have value and would be automatically exercised or would remain open beyond the last day of exercise; and offset all short options on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash (Sec. 190.02(f)(1)).</p><p class="depth0">6. Compute estimated funded balance for each customer commodity contract account containing open commodity contracts (Sec. 190.04(b)) (daily thereafter).</p><p class="depth0">7. Make margin calls if necessary (Sec. 190.02(g)(1)) (daily thereafter).</p><p class="depth0">8. Liquidate or offset any open commodity contact account for which a customer has failed to meet a margin call (Sec. 190.02(f)(1)) (daily thereafter).</p><p class="depth0">9. Commence liquidation or offset of specifically identifiable property described in Sec. 190.02(f)(2)(i) (property which has lost 10% or more of value) (and as appropriate thereafter).</p><p class="depth0">10. Commence liquidation or offset of property described in Sec. 190.02(f)(3) (``all other property'').</p><p class="depth0">11. Be aware of any contracts in delivery position and rules pertaining to such contracts (Sec. 190.05).</p><p class="depth0">First Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief</p><p class="depth0">1. If a transfer occurred on the date of entry of the order for relief:</p><p class="depth0">a. Liquidate any remaining open commodity contracts, except any dealer option or specifically identifiable commodity contract [hedge] (See Sec. 190.01(kk)(2) and Sec. 190.02(f)(1)), and not otherwise transferred in the transfer.</p><p class="depth0">b.

publish notice for customer instructions regarding the return of specifically identifiable property other than commodity contracts (Sec.

Second publication date for customer instructions (Sec. 190.02(b)(1)) (publication is to be made on two consecutive days, whether or not the second day is a business day).</p><p class="depth0">2.

If your property is not margining an open contract, this amount will approximate the difference between the market value of your property and your pro rata share of the estate, as estimated by the trustee. If your property is margining an open commodity contract, this amount will be approximately the full fair market value of the property on the date of its return.</p><p class="depth0">Kinds of Property to Which This Notice Applies</p><p class="depth0">1.

Any warehouse receipt, bill of lading or other document of title deposited as margin which, as of (date petition was filed), was securing an open commodity contract and--can be identified in (commodity broker)'s records as being held for your account, and--is neither in bearer form nor otherwise transferable by delivery.</p><p class="depth0">4. Any warehouse receipt bill of lading or other document of title, or any commodity received, acquired or held by (commodity broker) to make or take delivery or exercise from or for your account and which--can be identified in (commodity broker)'s records as received from or for your account as held specifically for the purpose of delivery or exercise.</p><p class="depth0">5. Any cash or other property deposited to make or take delivery on a commodity contract may be eligible to be returned. The trustee should be contacted directly for further information if you have deposited such property with (commodity broker) and desire its return.</p><p class="depth0">Instructions must be received by (the 5th calendar day after 2d publication date) or the trustee will liquidate your property. (If you own such property but fail to provide the trustee with instructions, you will still have a claim against (commodity broker) but you will not be able to have your specific property returned to you).</p><p class="depth0">Note: Prior to receipt of your instructions, circumstances may require the trustee to liquidate your property, or transfer your property to another broker if it is margining open commodity contracts. If your property is transferred and your instructions were received within the required time, your instructions will be forwarded to the new broker.</p><p class="depth0">Instructions should be directed to: (Trustee's name, address, and/or telephone).</p><p class="depth0">Even if you request the return of your property, you must also pay the trustee the amount he specifies and provide the trustee with proof of your claim before (the 7th calendar day after 2d publication date) or your property will be liquidated.

[77 FR 6382, Feb. 7, 2012]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix B to Part 190--Special Bankruptcy Distributions</p><p class="depth0">Framework 1--Special Distribution of Customer Funds for Futures</p><p class="depth0">Contracts When FCM Participated in Cross-Margining</p><p class="depth0">The Commission has established the following distributional convention with respect to ``customer funds'' (as Sec. 1.3 of this chapter defines such term) for futures contracts held by a futures commission merchant (FCM) that participated in a cross-margining (XM) program which shall apply if participating market professionals sign an agreement that makes reference to this distributional rule and the form of such agreement has been approved by the Commission by rule, regulation or order:</p><p class="depth0">All customer funds for futures contracts held in respect of XM accounts, regardless of the product that customers holding such accounts are trading, are required by Commission order to be segregated separately from all other customer segregated funds. For purposes of this distributional rule, XM accounts will be deemed to be commodity interest accounts and securities held in XM accounts will be deemed to be received by the FCM to margin, guarantee or secure commodity interest contracts. The maintenance

of property in an XM account will result in subordination of the claim for such property to certain non-XM customer claims and thereby will operate to cause such XM claim not to be treated as a customer claim for purposes of the Securities Investors Protection Act and the XM securities to be excluded from the securities estate. This creates subclasses of futures customer accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account (a person could hold each type of account), and results in two pools of segregated funds belonging to futures customers: An XM pool and a non-XM pool. In the event that there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer class segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds, all futures customer net equity claims, whether or not they arise out of the XM subclass of accounts, will be combined and will be paid pro rata out of the total pool of available XM and non-XM customer funds for futures contracts. In the event that there is a shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer segregated funds, then futures customer net equity claims arising from the XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the XM pool of customer segregated funds, and futures customer net equity claims arising from the non-XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the non-XM customer segregated funds. Furthermore, in the event that there is a shortfall in both the non-XM and XM pools of customer segregated funds: (1) If the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the non-XM pool is greater than or equal to the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool, all futures customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata; and (2) if the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool is greater than the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement of the non-XM pool, non-XM futures customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available non-XM segregated funds, and XM futures customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available XM segregated funds. In this way, non-XM customers will never be adversely affected by an XM shortfall.</p><p class="depth0">The following examples illustrate the operation of this convention. The examples assume that the FCM has two customers, one with exclusively XM accounts and one with exclusively non-XM accounts. However, the examples would apply equally if there were only one customer, with both an XM account and a non-XM account.

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES</p><p class="depth0">A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.</p><p class="depth0">An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL</p><p class="depth0">There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
INQUIRIES</p><p class="depth0">For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.</p><p class="depth0">For inquiries concerning CFR reference assistance, call 202-741-6000 or write to the Director, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001 or e-mail fedreg.info@nara.gov.
