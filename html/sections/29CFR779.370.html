                                Sec. 779.370  Cemeteries may qualify as exempt 13(a)(2) establishments.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of the Act if it meets all the  requirements of that section, including the requirement that the retail  or service establishment be open to the general public. So long as a  cemetery is open to any persons of   a particular religion rather than merely the members of a specific  organization or place of worship, it will be considered for enforcement  purposes to be ``open to the general public.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual dollar volume. As used in the Act, annual gross volume  means the gross receipts from all the business activities of the  establishment during a 12-month period (see Sec. Sec. 779.265 through  779.269). Sums received from the following types of transactions are  part of the annual gross volume of sales made or business done:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sales of lots or plots.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual tax or assessment levied on lot owners, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gifts or bequests.  Interest from any trust funds for permanent or current maintenance is  also included in the annual gross volume of sales made or business done.  The allocation of the gross receipts to any trust funds or other  accounts of the establishment does not affect the annual gross volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonretail sales or income. Sales of lots or plots to a burial  society or a fraternal organization for the use of the members are sales  for resale and as such may not be counted as part of the 75 percent of  annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services which is not for  resale and recognized as retail in the industry under section 13(a)(2).  Such sales are counted as part of the annual gross volume in the period  in which the transaction between the cemetery and the burial society or  fraternal organization is completed. Any interest from trust funds or  other investments also is not recognized as retail receipts under  section 13(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2">Automobile, Truck and Farm Implement Sales and Services, and Trailer,</p><p class="depth2">Boat and Aircraft Sales</p>
