In any proceeding before the Commission for  decision, the Commission, upon the request of any participant or on its  own initiative, may order oral argument when, in the Commission's  discretion, time permits, and the nature of the proceedings, the  complexity or importance of the issues of fact or law involved, and  public interest warrants such argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How requested. Any participant in a proceeding before the  Commission for decision may request oral argument before the Commission  by filing a timely motion pursuant to Sec. 3001.21. In a proceeding  before the Commission on exceptions to an intermediate decision, such  motion shall be filed no later than the date for the filing of briefs on  exceptions. Motions requesting oral argument may be included in briefs  or briefs on exceptions or in a separate document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of oral argument. The Commission shall rule on requests  for oral argument, and if argument is allowed, the Commission shall  notify the participants of the time and place set for argument, the  amount of time allowed each participant, and the issue or issues on  which oral argument is to be heard. Unless otherwise ordered by the  Commission, oral argument shall be limited to matters properly raised on  the record and in the briefs before the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of documents at oral argument. Charts, graphs, maps, tables  and other written material may be presented to the Commission at oral  argument only if limited to facts in the record of the case being argued  and if copies of such documents are filed with the Secretary   and served on all parties at least 7 days in advance of the argument.
