At the conclusion of the hearing and before the ALJ issues an initial decision in the proceedings, the parties are entitled to submit oral proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the ALJ, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or exceptions. At the conclusion of the hearing, a party may waive final oral argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Posthearing briefs.
