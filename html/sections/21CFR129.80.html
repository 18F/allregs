                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of product water. All treatment of product water by  distillation, ion-exchanging, filtration, ultraviolet treatment, reverse  osmosis, carbonation, mineral addition, or any other process shall be  done in a manner so as to be effective in accomplishing its intended  purpose and in accordance with section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act. All such processes shall be performed in and by  equipment and with substances which will not adulterate the bottled  product. A record of the type and date of physical inspections of such  equipment, conditions found, and the performance and effectiveness of  such equipment shall be maintained by the plant. Product water samples  shall be taken after processing and prior to bottling by the plant and  analyzed as often as is necessary to assure uniformity and effectiveness  of the processes performed by the plant. The methods of analysis shall  be those approved by the government agency or agencies having  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Containers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Multiservice primary containers shall be  adequately cleaned, sanitized, and inspected just prior to being filled,  capped, and sealed. Containers found to be unsanitary or defective by  the inspection shall be reprocessed or discarded. All multiservice  primary containers shall   be washed, rinsed, and sanitized by mechanical washers or by any other  method giving adequate sanitary results. Mechanical washers shall be  inspected as often as is necessary to assure adequate performance.  Records of physical maintenance, inspections and conditions found, and  performance of the mechanical washer shall be maintained by the plant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiservice shipping cases shall be maintained in such  condition as to assure they will not contaminate the primary container  or the product water. Adequate dry or wet cleaning procedures shall be  performed as often as necessary to maintain the cases in satisfactory  condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cleaning and sanitizing solutions. Cleaning and sanitizing  solutions utilized by the plant shall be sampled and tested by the plant  as often as is necessary to assure adequate performance in the cleaning  and sanitizing operations. Records of these tests shall be maintained by  the plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sanitizing operations. Sanitizing operations, including those  performed by chemical means or by any other means such as circulation of  live steam or hot water, shall be adequate to effect sanitization of the  intended product water-contact surfaces and any other critical area. The  plant should maintain a record of the intensity of the sanitizing agent  and the time duration that the agent was in contact with the surface  being sanitized. The following times and intensities shall be considered  a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Steam in enclosed system: At least 170 F for at least 15  minutes or at least 200 F for at least 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hot water in enclosed system: At least 170 F for at least 15  minutes or at least 200 F for at least 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Chemical sanitizers shall be equivalent in bactericidal action  to a 2-minute exposure of 50 parts per million of available chlorine at  57 F when used as an immersion or circulating solution. Chemical  sanitizers applied as a spray or fog shall have as a minimum 100 parts  per million of available chlorine at 57 F or its equivalent in  bactericidal action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 0.1 part per million ozone water solution in an enclosed system  for at least 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When containers are sanitized using a substance other than one  provided for in Sec. 178.1010 of this chapter, such substance shall be  removed from the surface of the container by a rinsing procedure. The  final rinse, prior to filling the container with product water, shall be  performed with a disinfected water rinse free of pathogenic bacteria or  by an additional sanitizing procedure equivalent in bactericidal action  to that required in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unit package production code. Each unit package from a batch or  segment of a continuous production run of bottled drinking water shall  be identified by a production code. The production code shall identify a  particular batch or segment of a continuous production run and the day  produced. The plant shall record and maintain information as to the kind  of product, volume produced, date produced, lot code used, and the  distribution of the finished product to wholesale and retail outlets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Filling, capping, or sealing. During the process of filling,  capping or sealing either single-service or multiservice containers, the  performance of the filler, capper or sealer shall be monitored and the  filled containers visually or electronically inspected to assure they  are sound, properly capped or sealed, and coded and labeled. Containers  which are not satisfactory shall be reprocessed or rejected. Only  nontoxic containers and closures shall be used. All containers and  closures shall be sampled and inspected to ascertain that they are free  from contamination. At least once each 3 months, a bacteriological swab  and/or rinse count should be made from at least four containers and  closures selected just prior to filling and sealing. No more than one of  the four samples may exceed more than one bacteria per milliliter of  capacity or one colony per square centimeter of surface area. All  samples shall be free of coliform organisms. The procedure and apparatus  for these bacteriological tests shall be in conformance with those  recognized by the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction.  Tests shall be performed either by qualified plant personnel or a  competent commercial laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Compliance procedures. A quality standard for bottled drinking  water is established in Sec. 165.110(b) of this chapter. To assure that  the plant's production of bottled drinking water complies with the  applicable standards, laws, and regulations of the government agency or  agencies having jurisdiction, the plant will analyze product samples as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For bacteriological purposes, take and analyze at least once a  week for total coliform a representative sample from a batch or segment  of a continuous production run for each type of bottled drinking water  produced during a day's production. The representative sample shall  consist of primary containers of product or unit packages of product. If  any coliform organisms are detected, follow-up testing must be conducted  to determine whether any of the coliform organisms are E. coli.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For chemical, physical, and radiological purposes, take and  analyze at least annually a representative sample from a batch or  segment of a continuous production run for each type of bottled drinking  water produced during a day's production. The representtive sample(s)  consists of primary containers of product of unit packages of product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Analyze such samples by methods approved by the government  agency or agencies having jurisdiction. The plant shall maintain records  of date of sampling, type of product sampled, production code, and  results of the analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Record retention. All records required by Secs. 129.1, 129.20,  129.35, 129.37, 129.40, and 129.80 shall be maintained at the plant for  not less than 2 years. Plants shall also retain, on file at the plant,  current certificates or notifications of approval issued by the  government agency or agencies approving the plant's source and supply of  product water and operations water. All required documents shall be  available for official review at reasonable times.
