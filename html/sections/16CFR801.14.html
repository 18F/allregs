                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of Section 7A(a)(2) and Sec. 801.1(h), the aggregate  total amount of voting securities and assets shall be the sum of:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth2">Examples: 1. Acquiring person ``A'' previously acquired less than  $50 million (as adjusted) of the voting securities (not convertible  voting securities) of corporation X. ``A'' now intends to acquire  additional assets of X. Under paragraph (a) of this section, ``A'' looks  to Sec. 801.13(a) and determines that the voting securities are to be  held ``as a result of'' the acquisition. Section 801.13(a) also provides  that ``A'' must determine the present value of the previously acquired  securities. Under paragraph (b) of this section, ``A'' looks to Sec.  801.13(b)(1) and determines that the assets to be acquired will be held  ``as a result of'' the acquisition, and are valued under Sec.  801.10(b). Therefore, if the voting securities have a present value  which when combined with the value of the assets would exceed $50  million (as adjusted), the asset acquisition is subject to the  requirements of the act since, as a result of it, ``A'' would hold an  aggregate total amount of the voting securities and assets of ``X'' in  excess of $50 million (as adjusted) .</p><p class="depth2">2. In the previous example, assume that the assets acquisition  occurred first, and that the acquisition of the voting securities is to  occur within 180 days of the first acquisition. ``A'' now looks to Sec.  801.13(b)(2) and determines that because the second acquisition is of  voting securities and not assets, the asset and voting securities  acquisitions are not treated as one transaction. Therefore, the second  acquisition would not be subject to the requirements of the act since  the value of the securities to be acquired does not exceed the $50  million (as adjusted) size-of-transaction test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.
