The system consists of Federal aids to navigation operated by the Coast  Guard, aids to navigation operated by the other armed services, and  private aids to navigation operated by other persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This part describes the general characteristics of the U.S.  Aids to Navigation System, and the details, policies and procedures  employed by the Coast Guard in establishing, maintaining, operating,  changing or discontinuing Federal aids to navigation. Regulations  concerning the marking of wrecks, structures, and other obstructions are  found in 33 CFR part 64. Regulations concerning private aids are found  in 33 CFR part 66. Regulations concerning the marking of artificial  islands and structures which are erected on or over the seabed and  subsoil of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States or its  possessions are found in 33 CFR part 67. Regulations concerning the  marking of bridges are found in 33 CFR part 118. Regulations concerning  aids to navigation at deepwater ports are found in subchapter NN of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The regulations found in 33 CFR subpart 66.10 expire on December  31, 2003, at which time the provisions of this part will apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Coast Guard maintains systems of marine aids to navigation  consisting of visual, audible, and electronic signals which are designed  to assist the prudent mariner in the process of navigation. The aids to  navigation system is not intended to identify every shoal or obstruction  to navigation which exists in the navigable waters of the United States,  but rather provides for reasonable marking of marine features as  resources permit. The primary objective of the aids to navigation system  is to mark navigable channels and waterways, obstructions adjacent to  these waterways, and obstructions in areas of general navigation which  may not be anticipated. Other waters, even if navigable, are generally  not marked.  [CGD 86-031, 52 FR 42640, Nov. 6, 1987, as amended by CGD 88-018, 54 FR  48608, Nov. 24, 1989; CGD 97-018, 63 FR 33573, June 19, 1998]</p>
