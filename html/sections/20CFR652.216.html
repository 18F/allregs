As part of the local Memorandum of Understanding, the State agency, as a One-Stop partner, may agree to have staff receive guidance from the One-Stop operator regarding the provision of labor exchange services. Personnel matters, including compensation, personnel actions, terms and conditions of employment, performance appraisals, and accountability of State merit-staff employees funded under the Act, remain under the authority of the State agency. The guidance given to employees must be consistent with the provisions of the Act, the local Memorandum of Understanding, and applicable collective bargaining agreements.</p>
