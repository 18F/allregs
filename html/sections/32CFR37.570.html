                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a participant has Federal procurement contracts that are  subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in part 30 of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the associated FAR Appendix (48 CFR  part 30 and 48 CFR 9903.201-1, respectively), you must alert the  participant during the pre-award negotiations to the potential for a CAS  violation, as well as the cognizant administrative contracting officer  (ACO) for the participant's procurement contracts, if you learn that the  participant plans to account differently for its own share and the  Federal Government's share of project costs under the TIA. This may  arise, for example, if a for-profit firm or other organization subject  to the FAR cost principles in 48 CFR parts 31 and 231 proposes to  charge:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Its share of project costs as independent research and  development (IR&D;) costs to enable recovery of the costs through Federal  Government procurement contracts, as allowed under the FAR cost  principles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Federal Government's share to the project, rather than as  IR&D; costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The reason for alerting the participant and the ACO is that the  inconsistent charging of the two shares could cause a noncompliance with  Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 402. Noncompliance with CAS 402 is a  potential issue only for a participant that has CAS-covered Federal  procurement contracts (note that CAS requirements do not apply to a for- profit participant's TIAs).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For for-profit participants with CAS-covered procurement  contracts, the cognizant ACO in most cases will be an individual within  the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). You can identify a  cognizant ACO at the DCMA by querying the contract administration team  locator that matches contractors with their ACOs (currently on the World  Wide Web at http://alerts.dcmdw.dcma.mil/support, a site that also can  be accessed through the DCMA home page at http://www.dcma.mil).</p>
