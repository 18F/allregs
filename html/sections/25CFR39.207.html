                            <p class="depth0">To determine a school's funding for the school year, OIEP uses the  following seven-step process:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Step 1. Multiply the appropriate base academic and/or  residential weight from Sec. 39.103 by the number of students in each  grade level category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Step 2. Multiply the number of students eligible for  supplemental program funding under Sec. 39.107 by the weights for the  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Step 3. Calculate the school-based supplemental weights under  Sec. 639.107.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Step 4. Add together the sums obtained in steps 1 through 3 to  obtain each school's total WSU.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Step 5. Add together the total WSUs for all Bureau-funded  schools.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Step 6. Calculate the value of a WSU by dividing the current  school year's funds by the average total WSUs as calculated under step 5  for the previous 3 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Step 7. Multiply each school's WSU total by the base value of  one WSU to determine funding for that school.</p>
