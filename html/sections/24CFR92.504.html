                                Sec. 92.504  Participating jurisdiction responsibilities;
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Responsibilities. The participating jurisdiction is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of its HOME program, ensuring that HOME funds are used in accordance with all program requirements and written agreements, and taking appropriate action when performance problems arise. The use of State recipients, subrecipients, or contractors does not relieve the participating jurisdiction of this responsibility. The performance and compliance of each contractor, State recipient, and subrecipient must be reviewed at least annually. The participating jurisdiction must have and follow written policies, procedures, and systems, including a system for assessing risk of activities and projects and a system for monitoring entities consistent with this section, to ensure

that the requirements of this part are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Executing a written agreement. Before disbursing any HOME funds to any entity, the participating jurisdiction must enter into a written agreement with that entity. Before disbursing any HOME funds to any entity, a State recipient, subrecipient, or contractor which is administering all or a part of the HOME program on behalf of the participating jurisdiction, must also enter into a written agreement with that entity. The written agreement must ensure compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provisions in written agreements. The contents of the agreement may vary depending upon the role the entity is asked to assume or the type of project undertaken. This section details basic requirements by role and the minimum provisions that must be included in a written agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State recipient. The provisions in the written agreement between the State and a State recipient will depend on the program functions that the State specifies the State recipient will carry out in accordance with Sec. 92.201(b). In accordance with Sec. 92.201, the written agreement must either require the State recipient to comply with the requirements established by the State or require the State recipient to establish its own requirements to comply with this part, including requirements for income determinations and underwriting subsidy layering guidelines, rehabilitation standards, refinancing guidelines, homebuyer program policies, and affordability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of the HOME funds. The agreement must describe the amount and use of the HOME funds to administer one or more programs to produce affordable housing, provide downpayment assistance, or provide tenant-based rental assistance, including the type and number of housing projects to be funded (e.g. the number of single- family homeowner loans to be made or number of homebuyers to receive downpayment assistance), tasks to be performed, a schedule for completing the tasks (including a schedule for committing funds to projects that meet the deadlines established by this part), a budget for each program, and any requirement for matching contributions. These items must be in sufficient detail to provide a sound basis for the State to effectively monitor performance under the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Affordability. The agreement must require housing assisted with HOME funds to meet the affordability requirements of Sec. 92.252 or Sec. 92.254, as applicable, and must require repayment of the funds if the housing does not meet the affordability requirements for the specified time period. The agreement must state if repayment of HOME funds or recaptured HOME funds must be remitted to the State or retained by the State recipient for additional eligible activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Program income. The agreement must state if program income is to be remitted to the State or to be retained by the State recipient for additional eligible activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Uniform administrative requirements. The agreement must require the State recipient to comply with applicable uniform administrative requirements, as described in Sec. 92.505.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Project requirement. The agreement must require compliance with project requirements in subpart F of this part, as applicable in accordance with the type of project assisted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Other program requirements. The agreement must require the State recipient to carry out each activity in compliance with all Federal laws and regulations described in subpart H of this part, except that the State recipient does not assume the State's responsibilities for release of funds under Sec. 92.352 and the intergovernmental review process in Sec. 92.357 does not apply to the State recipient.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Affirmative marketing. The agreement must specify the State recipient's affirmative marketing responsibilities in accordance with Sec. 92.351.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Requests for disbursement of funds. The agreement must specify that the State recipient may not request disbursement of HOME funds under this agreement until the funds are needed for payment of eligible costs. The amount of each request must be limited to the amount needed. Program income must be disbursed before the State recipient requests funds from the State.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Records and reports. The agreement must specify the particular records that must be maintained and the information or reports that must be submitted in order to assist the State in meeting its recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Enforcement of the agreement. The agreement must provide for a means of enforcement of affordable housing requirements by the State or the intended beneficiaries, if the State recipient will be the owner at project completion of the affordable housing. The means of enforcement may include liens on real property, deed restrictions, or covenants running with the land. The affordability requirements in Sec. 92.252 must be enforced by deed restriction. In addition, the agreement must specify remedies for breach of the HOME requirements. The agreement must specify that, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.43, suspension or termination may occur if the State recipient materially fails to comply with any term of the agreement. The State may permit the agreement to be terminated for convenience in accordance with 24 CFR 85.44.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Written agreement. Before the State recipient provides funds to for-profit owners or developers, nonprofit owners or developers or sponsors, subrecipients, homeowners, homebuyers, tenants (or landlords) receiving tenant-based rental assistance, or contractors who are providing services to the State recipient, the State recipient must have a written agreement with such entities that meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Duration of the agreement. The duration of the agreement will depend on which functions the State recipient performs (e.g., whether the State recipient or the State has responsibility for monitoring rental projects for the period of affordability) and which activities are funded under the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Fees. The agreement must prohibit the State recipient and its subrecipients and community housing development organizations from charging servicing, origination, processing, inspection, or other fees for the costs of administering a HOME program, except as permitted by Sec. 92.214(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subrecipient. A subrecipient is a public agency or nonprofit organization selected by the participating jurisdiction to administer all or some of the participating jurisdiction's HOME programs to produce affordable housing, provide downpayment assistance, or provide tenant-based rental assistance. The agreement must set forth and require the subrecipient to follow the participating jurisdiction's requirements, including requirements for income determinations, underwriting and subsidy layering guidelines, rehabilitation standards, refinancing guidelines, homebuyer program policies, and affordability requirements. The agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the subrecipient must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use of the HOME funds. The agreement must describe the amount and use of the HOME funds for one or more programs, including the type and number of housing projects to be funded (e.g., the number of single-family homeowners loans to be made or the number of homebuyers to receive downpayment assistance), tasks to be performed, a schedule for completing the tasks (including a schedule for committing funds to projects in accordance with deadlines established by this part), a budget, any requirement for matching contributions and the period of the agreement. These items must be in sufficient detail to provide a sound basis for the participating jurisdiction to effectively monitor performance under the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Program income. The agreement must state if program income is to be remitted to the participating jurisdiction or to be retained by the subrecipient for additional eligible activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Uniform administrative requirements. The agreement must require the subrecipient to comply with applicable uniform administrative requirements, as described in Sec. 92.505.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Other program requirements. The agreement must require the subrecipient to carry out each activity in compliance with all Federal laws and regulations described in subpart H of this part, except that the subrecipient

does not assume the participating jurisdiction's responsibilities for environmental review under Sec. 92.352 and the intergovernmental review process in Sec. 92.357 does not apply. The agreement must set forth the requirements the subrecipient must follow to enable the participating jurisdiction to carry environmental review responsibilities before HOME funds are committed to a project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Affirmative marketing. The agreement must specify the subrecipient's affirmative marketing responsibilities in accordance with Sec. 92.351.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Requests for disbursement of funds. The agreement must specify that the subrecipient may not request disbursement of funds under the agreement until the funds are needed for payment of eligible costs. The amount of each request must be limited to the amount needed. Program income must be disbursed before the subrecipient requests funds from the participating jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Reversion of assets. The agreement must specify that upon expiration of the agreement, the subrecipient must transfer to the participating jurisdiction any HOME funds on hand at the time of expiration and any accounts receivable attributable to the use of HOME funds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Records and reports. The agreement must specify the particular records that must be maintained and the information or reports that must be submitted in order to assist the participating jurisdiction in meeting its recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Enforcement of the agreement. The agreement must specify remedies for breach of the provisions of the agreement. The agreement must specify that, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.43, suspension or termination may occur if the subrecipient materially fails to comply with any term of the agreement. The participating jurisdiction may permit the agreement to be terminated for convenience in accordance with 24 CFR 85.44.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Written agreement. Before the subrecipient provides HOME funds to for-profit owners or developers, nonprofit owners or developers or sponsors, subrecipients, homeowners, homebuyers, tenants (or landlords) receiving tenant-based rental assistance, or contractors, the subrecipient must have a written agreement that meets the requirements of this section.

The agreement must prohibit the subrecipient and any community housing development organizations from charging servicing, origination, or other fees for the costs of administering the HOME program, except as permitted by Sec. 92.214(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For-profit or nonprofit housing owner, sponsor, or developer (other than single-family owner-occupant). The participating jurisdiction may preliminarily award HOME funds for a proposed project, contingent on conditions such as obtaining other financing for the project. This preliminary award is not a commitment to a project.

The participating jurisdiction may establish a list of non-hazardous deficiencies for which correction can be verified by third party documentation (e.g., paid invoice for work order) rather than re-inspection. Health and safety deficiencies must be corrected immediately, in accordance with Sec. 92.251. The participating jurisdiction must adopt a more frequent inspection schedule for properties that have been found to have health and safety deficiencies.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The property owner must annually certify to the participating jurisdiction that each building and all HOME- assisted units in the project are suitable for occupancy, taking into account State and local health, safety, and other applicable codes, ordinances, and requirements, and the ongoing property standards established by the participating jurisdiction to meet the requirements of Sec. 92.251.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Inspections must be based on a statistically valid sample of units appropriate for the size of the HOME-assisted project, as set forth by HUD through notice.
