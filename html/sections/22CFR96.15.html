                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following examples illustrate the rules of Sec. Sec. 96.12 to  96.14:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Identifying a child for adoption and arranging an  adoption. Agency X identifies children eligible for adoption in the  United States on a TV program in an effort to recruit prospective  adoptive parent(s). A couple in a foreign country calls Agency X about  one of the children. Agency X refers them to an agency or person in the  United States who arranges intercountry adoptions. Agency X does not  require accreditation, temporarily accreditation, approval or  supervision because it is not both identifying and arranging the  adoption. In contrast, Agency Y, located in the United States, provides  information about children eligible for adoption in a foreign country on  a website and then arranges for interested U.S. parents to adopt those  children. Agency Y must be accredited, approved, or supervised because,  in addition to identifying children eligible for adoption, it is also  helping to arrange the adoption.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Child welfare services exemption. Doctor X evaluates the  medical records and a video of Child Y. The evaluation will be used in  an intercountry adoption as part of the placement of Child Y and is the  only service that Doctor X provides in the United States with regard to  Child Y's adoption. Doctor X (not employed with an accredited agency or  approved person) does not need to be approved or supervised because she  is not providing an adoption service as defined in Sec. 96.2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Home study exemption. Social Worker X, in the United  States, (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person)  interviews Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, obtains a criminal background  study, and checks the references of Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, then  composes a report and submits the report to an accredited agency for use  in an intercountry adoption. Social Worker X does not provide any other  services to Prospective Adoptive Parent Y. Social Worker X qualifies as  an exempted provider and therefore need not be approved or operate as  supervised provider. In contrast, Social Worker Z, in the United States,  (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person) prepares a  home study report for Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) W, and in addition  re-enters the house after Child V has been placed with Prospective  Adoptive Parent(s) W to assess how V and W are adjusting to life as a  family. This assessment is post-placement monitoring, which is an  adoption service. Therefore, Social Worker Z would need to become  approved before providing this assessment for this intercountry adoption  or else operate as a supervised provider. If an agency or person  provides an adoption service in addition to a home study or child  background study, the agency or person needs to become accredited,  approved, or supervised before providing that adoption service.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Child background study exemption. An employee of Agency X  interviews Child Y in the United States and compiles a   report concerning Child Y's social and developmental history for use in  an intercountry adoption. Agency X provides no other adoption services  on behalf of Child Y. Agency X does not need to be accredited, approved,  or supervised. Agency X is only conducting and creating a child  background study, and therefore is an exempted provider. In contrast, an  employee of Agency Z interviews Child W in the United States and creates  a child background study for use in an intercountry adoption. Agency Z  subsequently identifies prospective adoptive parent(s) and arranges a  new adoption when Child W's previous adoption becomes disrupted. Agency  Z needs to be accredited, approved, or supervised before providing this  service. If an agency or person provides an adoption service in addition  to a child background study or home study, the agency or person needs to  be accredited, approved, or supervised before providing the additional  service.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Home study and child welfare services exemptions. Agency  X interviews Prospective Adoptive Parent Y, obtains a criminal  background check, checks the references of Prospective Adoptive Parent  Y, then composes a home study and submits it to an accredited agency for  use in an intercountry adoption in the United States. Parent Y later  joins a post-adoption support group for adoptive parents sponsored by  Agency X. If Agency X performs no other adoption services, Agency X does  not need to be accredited, approved, or supervised. If an agency or  person provides a home study or child background study as well as other  services in the United States that do not require accreditation,  approval, or supervision, and no other adoption services, the agency or  person is an exempted provider.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Exempted provider. Agency X interviews Prospective  Adoptive Parent(s) Y, obtains a criminal background check, checks the  references of Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y, and then composes a home  study and submits the report to an accredited agency. In addition,  Agency X interviews Child Z and compiles a report concerning Child Z's  social and developmental history. All of Agency X's work is done in the  United States. Both reports will be used in an intercountry adoption. If  Agency X performs no other adoption services, Agency X does not need to  be accredited, approved, or supervised. If an agency or person provides  a home study and child background study as well as other services that  do not require accreditation, approval or supervision, and no other  adoption services, the agency or person is an exempted provider.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Legal services exemption. Attorney X (not employed with  an accredited agency or approved person) provides advice and counsel to  Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y on filling out DHS paperwork required  for an intercountry adoption. Among other papers, Attorney X prepares an  affidavit of consent to termination of parental rights and to adoption  of Child W to be signed by the birth mother in the United States.  Attorney X must be approved or supervised because securing consent to  termination of parental rights is an adoption service. In contrast,  Attorney Z (not employed with an accredited agency or approved person)  assists Adoptive Parent(s) T to complete an adoption in the State in  which they reside, after they have been granted an adoption in Child V's  foreign country of origin. Attorney Z is exempt from approval or  supervision because she is providing legal services, but no adoption  services.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Post-placement monitoring. A court in a foreign country  has granted custody of Child W to Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y  pending the completion of W's adoption. Agency X interviews both  Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y and Child W in their home in the United  States. Agency X gathers information on the adjustment of Child W as a  member of the family and inquires into the social and educational  progress of Child W. Agency X must be accredited, approved, or  supervised. Agency X's activities constitute post-placement monitoring,  which is an adoption service. In contrast, if Person Z provided  counseling for Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y and/or Child W, but  provided no adoption services in the United States to the family, Person  Z would not need to be approved or supervised. Post-placement counseling  is different than post-placement monitoring because it does not relate  to evaluating the adoption placement. Post-placement counseling is not  an adoption service and does not trigger the accreditation/approval  requirements of the IAA or the UAA and this part.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Post-adoption services. Foreign Country H requires that  post-adoption reports be completed and sent to its Central Authority  every year until adopted children reach the age of 18. Agency X provides  support groups and a newsletter for U.S. parents that have adopted  children from Country H and encourages parents to complete their post- adoption reports annually. Agency X does not need to be accredited,  approved, or supervised because it is providing only post-adoption  services. Post-adoption services are not included in the definition of  adoption services, and therefore, do not trigger accreditation/approval  requirements of the IAA or the UAA and this part.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. Assuming custody and providing services after a  disruption. Agency X provides counseling for Prospective Adoptive  Parent(s) Y and for Child W pending the completion of Child W's  intercountry adoption. The adoption eventually disrupts. Agency X helps  recruit and identify new prospective adoptive parent(s) for Child W, but  it is Agency P that assumes custody of Child   W and places him in foster care until an alternative adoptive placement  can be found. Agency X is not required to be accredited, approved, or  supervised because it is not providing an adoption service in the United  States as defined in Sec. 96.2. Agency P, on the other hand, is  providing an adoption service and would have to be accredited, approved,  or supervised.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Making non-judicial determinations of best interest of  child and appropriateness of adoptive placement of child. Agency X  receives information about and a videotape of Child W from the  institution where Child W lives in a foreign country. Based on the age,  sex, and health problems of Child W, Agency X matches Prospective  Adoptive Parent(s) Y with Child W. Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y  receive a referral from Agency X and agree to accept the referral and  proceed with the adoption of Child W. Agency X determines that  Prospective Adoptive Parent(s) Y are a good placement for Child W and  notifies the competent authority in W's country of origin that it has  found a match for Child W and will start preparing adoption paperwork.  All of Agency X's services are provided in the United States. Agency X  is performing an adoption service and must be accredited, approved, or  supervised.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. Securing necessary consent to termination of parental  rights and to adoption. Facilitator Y is accredited by Convention  Country Z. He has contacts at several orphanages in Foreign Country Z  and helps Agency X match children eligible for adoption with prospective  adoptive parent(s) in the United States. Facilitator Y works with the  institution that is the legal guardian of Child W in order to get the  documents showing the institution's legal consent to the adoption of  Child W. Agency X is the only U.S. agency providing adoption services in  the case. Agency X must be accredited, or approved and must either treat  Facilitator Y as a foreign supervised provider in accordance with Sec.  96.46(a) and (b) or verify the consents Facilitator Y secured, in  accordance with Sec. 96.46(c).
