                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Level 1 regular tour of duty. For an agent with a Level 1 regular tour of duty and a 25 percent overtime supplement, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agent has an officially established weekly regular tour of duty generally consisting of five 10-hour workdays (an 8-hour basic workday and 2 regularly scheduled overtime hours);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agent's 8-hour basic workday (regular time) may be interrupted by an unpaid off-duty meal break;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The obligation to perform 2 hours of overtime work on a day including part of the agent's regular tour of duty does not apply if the agent performs no work during regular time on that day, subject to paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As compensation for regularly scheduled overtime hours within the regular tour of duty, the agent is entitled to an overtime supplement equal to 25 percent of the agent's hourly rate of basic pay times the number of paid hours of regular time for the agent in the pay period (subject to the premium cap in Sec. Sec. 550.105 and 550.107 and the restriction in Sec. 550.1626(a)(5)), and no additional compensation or compensatory time off may be provided for such overtime hours;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For any additional regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty, the agent is entitled to overtime pay as provided in Sec. 550.1624, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 550.1626;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For any irregular overtime hours, the agent is entitled to be credited with compensatory time off as provided in Sec. 550.1625, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 550.1626;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The agent must be charged corresponding amounts of paid leave, compensatory time off, other paid time off, or time in nonpay status for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent from duty during regular time, as provided in Sec. 550.1634, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 550.1626(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the agent is absent during regularly scheduled overtime hours within the agent's regular tour of duty that the agent is obligated to work, the agent accrues an obligation to perform

other overtime work for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent, and such obligation must be satisfied as provided in Sec. 550.1626.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Level 2 regular tour of duty. For an agent with a Level 2 regular tour of duty and a 12.5 percent overtime supplement, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agent has an officially established weekly regular tour of duty generally consisting of five 9-hour workdays (an 8-hour basic workday and 1 regularly scheduled overtime hour);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agent's 8-hour basic workday (regular time) may be interrupted by an unpaid off-duty meal break;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The obligation to perform 1 hour of overtime work on a day including part of the agent's regular tour of duty does not apply if the agent performs no work during regular time on that day, subject to paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As compensation for regularly scheduled overtime hours within the regular tour of duty, the agent receives an overtime supplement equal to 12.5 percent of the agent's hourly rate of basic pay times the number of paid hours of regular time for the agent in the pay period (subject to the premium cap in Sec. Sec. 550.105 and 550.107 and the restriction in Sec. 550.1626(a)(5)), and no additional compensation or compensatory time off may be provided for such overtime hours;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For any additional regularly scheduled overtime hours outside the regular tour of duty, the agent is entitled to overtime pay as provided in Sec. 550.1624, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 550.1626;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For any irregular overtime hours, the agent is entitled to be credited with compensatory time off as provided in Sec. 550.1625, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 550.1626;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The agent must be charged corresponding amounts of paid leave, compensatory time off, other paid time off, or time in nonpay status for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent from duty during regular time, as provided in Sec. 550.1634, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 550.1626(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the agent is absent during regularly scheduled overtime hours within the agent's regular tour of duty that the agent is obligated to work, the agent accrues an obligation to perform other overtime work for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent, and such obligation must be satisfied as provided in Sec. 550.1626.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basic regular tour of duty. For an agent with a Basic regular tour of duty that includes no scheduled overtime hours and provides no overtime supplement, the following rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The agent has an officially established weekly regular tour of duty generally consisting of five 8-hour basic workdays;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The agent's 8-hour basic workday (regular time) may be interrupted by an unpaid off-duty meal break;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For any regularly scheduled overtime hours, the agent is entitled to overtime pay as provided in Sec. 550.1624, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 550.1626;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any irregular overtime hours, the agent is entitled to be credited with compensatory time off as provided in Sec. 550.1625, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 550.1626; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The agent must be charged corresponding amounts of paid leave, compensatory time off, other paid time off, or time in nonpay status for each hour (or part thereof) the agent is absent from duty during regular time, as provided in Sec. 550.1634, except as otherwise provided in Sec. 550.1626(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of premium pay cap. If a premium pay cap established under 5 U.S.C. 5547 and Sec. Sec. 550.105 and 550.107 limits payment of an overtime supplement or regularly scheduled overtime pay, or limits crediting of compensatory time off, the affected agent is still required to perform assigned overtime work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Meaning of ``work''. In applying paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) of this section, the term ``work'' refers to paid hours of work, consistent with Sec. 550.112, except that paid leave and other paid time off when an agent is excused from duty are not considered to be work hours. Official time under 5 U.S.C. 7131 during regular time is considered to be paid hours of ``work'' during the time an employee otherwise would be in a duty status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Approval of absences. Any absence during obligated overtime hours (as described in paragraphs (a)(8) and (b)(8) of this section) is subject to management approval under CBP policies.</p>
