The validity of each  assumption used shall be evaluated solely with respect to that  assumption. Actuarial assumptions used in calculating the amount of an  unfunded actuarial liability shall be the same as those used for other  components of pension cost.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For qualified defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of  pension costs shall recognize the requirements of 9904.412-50(b)(7) for  periods beginning with the ``Applicability Date of the CAS Pension  Harmonization Rule.'' However, paragraphs 9904.413-50(c)(8), (9) and  (12) are exempt from the requirements of 9904.412-50(b)(7).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> (2) and (5), the amount of pension cost  computed for a cost accounting period is assignable only to that period.  For defined-benefit pension plans other than those accounted for under  the pay-as-you-go cost method, the pension cost is assignable only if  the sum of (1) the unamortized portions of assignable unfunded actuarial  liability developed and amortized pursuant to 9904.412-50(a)(1), and (2)  the unassignable portions of unfunded actuarial liability separately  identified and maintained pursuant to 9904.412-50(a)(2) equals the total  unfunded actuarial liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>. Pension costs not meeting these requirements may not be  reassigned to any future cost accounting period.  [60 FR 16541, Mar. 30, 1995, as amended at 76 FR 81309, Dec. 27, 2011]</p>
