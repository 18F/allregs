                                Sec. 330.1  Purpose and policy.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This part describes the policy and procedures used in  the Department of the Army's nationwide permit program to issue, modify,  suspend, or revoke nationwide permits; to identify conditions,  limitations, and restrictions on the nationwide permits; and, to  identify any procedures, whether required or optional, for authorization  by nationwide permits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nationwide permits. Nationwide permits (NWPs) are a type of  general permit issued by the Chief of Engineers and are designed to  regulate with little, if any, delay or paperwork certain activities  having minimal impacts. The NWPs are proposed, issued, modified,  reissued (extended), and revoked from time to time after an opportunity  for public notice and comment. Proposed NWPs or modifications to or  reissuance of existing NWPs will be adopted only after the Corps gives  notice and allows the public an opportunity to comment on and request a  public hearing regarding the proposals. The Corps will give full  consideration to all comments received prior to reaching a final  decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terms and conditions. An activity is authorized under an NWP  only if that activity and the permittee satisfy all of the NWP's terms  and conditions. Activities that do not qualify for authorization under  an NWP still may be authorized by an individual or regional general  permit. The Corps will consider unauthorized any activity requiring  Corps authorization if that activity is under construction or completed  and does not comply with all of the terms and conditions of an NWP,  regional general permit, or an individual permit. The Corps will  evaluate unauthorized activities for enforcement action under 33 CFR  part 326. The district engineer (DE) may elect to suspend enforcement  proceedings if the permittee modifies his project to comply with an NWP  or a regional general permit. After considering whether a violation was  knowing or intentional, and other indications of the need for a penalty,  the DE can elect to terminate an enforcement proceeding with an after- the-fact authorization under an NWP, if all terms and conditions of the  NWP have been satisfied, either before or after the activity has been  accomplished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Discretionary authority. District and division engineers have  been delegated a discretionary authority to suspend, modify, or revoke  authorizations under an NWP. This discretionary authority may be used by  district and division engineers only to further condition or restrict  the applicability of an NWP for cases where they have concerns for the  aquatic environment under the Clean Water Act section 404(b)(1)  Guidelines or for any factor of the public interest. Because of the  nature of most activities authorized by NWP, district and division  engineers will not have to review every such activity to decide whether  to exercise discretionary authority. The terms and conditions of certain  NWPs require the DE to review the proposed activity before the NWP  authorizes its construction. However, the DE has the discretionary  authority to review any activity authorized by NWP to determine whether  the activity complies with the NWP. If the DE finds that the proposed  activity would have more than minimal individual or cumulative net  adverse effects on the environment or otherwise may be contrary to the  public interest, he shall modify the NWP authorization to reduce or  eliminate those adverse effects, or he shall instruct the prospective  permittee to apply for a regional general permit or an individual  permit. Discretionary authority is also discussed at 33 CFR 330.4(e) and  330.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In most cases, permittees may proceed with  activities authorized by NWPs without notifying the DE. However, the  prospective permittee should carefully review the language of the NWP to  ascertain whether he must notify the DE prior to commencing the  authorized activity. For NWPs requiring advance notification, such  notification must be made in writing as early as possible prior to  commencing the proposed activity. The permittee may presume that his  project qualifies for the NWP unless he is otherwise notified by the DE  within a 45-day period. The 45-day period starts on the date of receipt  of the notification in the Corps district office and ends 45 calendar  days later regardless of weekends or holidays. If the DE notifies the  prospective permittee that the notification is incomplete, a new 45-day  period will commence upon receipt of the revised notification. The  prospective permittee may not proceed with the proposed activity before  expiration of the 45-day period unless otherwise notified by the DE. If  the DE fails to act within the 45-day period, he must use the procedures  of 33 CFR 330.5 in order to modify, suspend, or revoke the NWP  authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DE will review the notification and may add activity- specific conditions to ensure that the activity complies with the terms  and conditions of the NWP and that the adverse impacts on the aquatic  environment and other aspects of the public interest are individually  and cumulatively minimal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For some NWPs involving discharges into wetlands, the  notification must include a wetland delineation. The DE will review the  notification and determine if the individual and cumulative adverse  environmental effects are more than minimal. If the adverse effects are  more than minimal the DE will notify the prospective permittee that an  individual permit is required or that the prospective permittee may  propose measures to mitigate the loss of special aquatic sites,  including wetlands, to reduce the adverse impacts to minimal. The  prospective permittee may elect to propose mitigation with the original  notification. The DE will consider that proposed mitigation when  deciding if the impacts are minimal. The DE shall add activity-specific  conditions to ensure that the mitigation will be accomplished. If  sufficient mitigation cannot be developed to reduce the adverse  environmental effects to the minimal level, the DE will not allow  authorization under the NWP and will instruct the prospective permittee  on procedures to seek authorization under an individual permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Individual Applications. DEs should review all incoming  applications for individual permits for possible eligibility under  regional general permits or NWPs. If the activity complies with the  terms and conditions of one or more NWP, he should verify the  authorization and so notify the applicant. If the DE determines that the  activity could comply after reasonable project modifications and/or  activity-specific conditions, he should notify the applicant of such  modifications and conditions. If such modifications and conditions are  accepted by the applicant, verbally or in writing, the DE will verify  the authorization with the modifications and conditions in accordance  with 33 CFR 330.6(a). However, the DE will proceed with processing the  application as an individual permit and take the appropriate action  within 15 calendar days of receipt, in accordance with 33 CFR  325.2(a)(2), unless the applicant indicates that he will accept the  modifications or conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Authority. NWPs can be issued to satisfy the permit requirements  of section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, section 404 of the  Clean Water Act, section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research, and  Sanctuaries Act, or some combination thereof. The applicable authority  will be indicated at the end of each NWP. NWPs and their conditions  previously published at 33 CFR 330.5 and 330.6 will remain in effect  until they expire or are modified or revoked in accordance with the  procedures of this part.  [56 FR 59134, Nov. 22, 1991, as amended at 78 FR 5733, Jan. 28, 2013]</p>
