                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. In the case of a taxpayer other than a bank (as  defined in section 581 and the regulations thereunder), no deduction  shall be allowed under section 166 (relating to bad debts) or section  165(g) (relating to worthlessness of securities) by reason of the  worthlessness of any debt, regardless of how it arose, owed by a  political party. For example, it is immaterial that the debt may have  arisen as a result of services rendered or goods sold or that the  taxpayer included the amount of the debt in income. In the case of a  bank, no deduction shall be allowed unless, under the facts and  circumstances, it appears that the bad debt was incurred to or purchased  by, or the worthless security was acquired by, the taxpayer in  accordance with its usual commercial practices. Thus, if a bank makes a  loan to a political party not in accordance with its usual commercial  practices but solely because the president of the bank has been active  in the party no bad debt deduction will be allowed with respect to the  loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Political party. For purposes of this section  and Sec. 1.276-1, the term political party means a political party (as  commonly understood), a National, State, or local committee thereof, or  any committee, association, or organization, whether incorporated or  not, which accepts contributions (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this  paragraph) or makes expenditures (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph) for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the  election of presidential or vice-presidential electors, or the  selection, nomination, or election of any individual to any Federal,  State, or local elective public office, whether or not such individual  or electors are selected, nominated, or elected. Accordingly, a  political party includes a committee or other group which accepts  contributions or makes expenditures for the purpose of promoting the  nomination of an individual for an elective public office in a primary  election, or in any convention, meeting, or caucus of a political party.  It is immaterial whether the contributions or expenditures are accepted  or made directly or indirectly. Thus, for example, a committee or other  group, is considered to be a political party, if, although it does not  expend any funds, it turns funds over to another organization, which  does expend funds for the purpose of attempting to influence the  nomination of an individual for an elective public office. An  organization which engages in activities which are truly nonpartisan in  nature will not be considered a political party merely because it  conducts activities with respect to an election campaign if, under all  the facts and circumstances, it is clear that its efforts are not  directed to the election of the candidates of any particular party or  parties or to the selection, nomination or election of any particular  candidate. For example, a committee or group will not be treated as a  political party if it is organized merely to inform the electorate as to  the identity and experience of all candidates involved, to present on a  nonpreferential basis the issues or views of the parties or candidates  as described by the parties or candidates, or to provide a forum in  which the candidates are freely invited on a nonpreferential basis to  discuss or debate the issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contributions. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.276-1,  the term contributions includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or  deposit, of money or anything of value, and includes a contract,  promise, or agreement to make a contribution, whether or not legally  enforceable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Expenditures. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.276-1,  the term expenditures includes a payment, distribution, loan, advance,  deposit, or gift, of money or anything of value, and includes a  contract, promise, or agreement to make an expenditure, whether or not  legally enforceable.
