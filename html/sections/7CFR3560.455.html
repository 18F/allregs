                                Sec. 3560.455  Special servicing actions related to loan accounts.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To prevent or correct a compliance violation or to  prevent or   cure a default in a situation that cannot be resolved through regular  servicing, the Agency may approve a deferral of loan payments or a loan  restructuring. Nothing herein precludes the Agency from initiating  appropriate legal action to correct a compliance violation if the Agency  determines such action is more in the Government's interest than  entering into a special servicing agreement as provided for in this  section. Procedures for debt collection are discussed in Sec. 3560.460.  As part of a workout agreement, the Agency may agree to accept less than  full monthly payment installments due on an Agency loan for a specified  period of time, not to exceed the effective period of the workout  agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loan reamortizations. A loan reamortization is a restructuring  of loan terms and conditions over a period of time that does not exceed  the remaining useful life of the housing project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loan reamortizations will only be approved when they are in the  best interest of the Federal Government and tenants and when the  following conditions are met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Agency determines that the borrower will be unable to meet  their obligations without a reduction in monthly payment installments;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Agency is satisfied that the security, including the  potential income for debt service, will be adequate to protect the  Agency's interest over the term of the reamortization and that the  reamortization will not adversely affect the Federal Government's lien  priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Agency approves a reamortization of a loan under this  section, it will be at the existing note rate, or the current interest  rate at the time of reamortization closing or approval, whichever is  less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loan reamortization may be used to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Restructure loan repayments to prevent or correct a compliance  violation or cure a default caused by circumstances beyond the  borrower's control in situations where the borrower is otherwise in  compliance with Agency requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repay principal, outstanding interest, overage, and advances  made by the Agency for recoverable cost items when less than full  payments were authorized under the provisions of an Agency approved  workout agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Restructure a borrower's loan payments in conjunction with an  incentive package developed in accordance with Sec. 3560.656 to prevent  prepayment of the loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Restructure an existing loan in conjunction with a subsequent  loan for rehabilitation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Restructure remaining debt when a portion of the property  serving as loan security is sold and there is a need to reestablish the  financial stability of the housing project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Loan writedowns. A loan writedown is a reduction of a borrower's  debt approved by the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loan writedowns will only be approved when they are in the best  interest of the Federal Government and when the following conditions  exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sound management of the housing project is evident or sound  management practices are proposed for correction in accordance with an  Agency approved workout agreement; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The housing project's financial stability is being affected by  conditions beyond the borrower's control, such as market weaknesses,  unforeseen site problems, or natural disasters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to Agency approval for a loan writedown, the borrower must  obtain an appraisal of the housing project that concludes the `` `as-is'  market value,'' subject to restricted rents, conducted in accordance  with subpart P of this part. The Agency will not approve a loan write- down unless the appraisal indicates the Federal Government's interests  are secured at the proposed writedown level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any writedown will be conditioned on a finding that the borrower  does not have the ability to pay a higher loan payment, even if the loan  is reamortized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Loan writedowns may be used to allow for a loan transfer and  assumption for less than the total amount of outstanding debt.</p>
