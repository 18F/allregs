                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The portable air compressor manufacturer shall include in the owner's manual or in other information supplied to the ultimate purchaser, the following statement:</p><p class="depth0">Noise Emissions Warranty</p><p class="depth0">The manufacturer warrants to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that this air compressor was designed, built, and equipped to conform at the time of sale to the first retail purchaser, with all applicable U.S. E.P.A. noise control regulations.</p><p class="depth0">This warranty is not limited to any particular part, component, or system of the air compressor. Defects in the design, assembly, or in any part, component, or system of the compressor which, at the time of sale to the first retail purchaser, caused noise emissions to exceed Federal standards are covered by this warranty for the life of the air compressor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]

Sec. 204.58-2  Tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For each configuration of air compressors covered by this part, the manufacturer shall develop a list of those acts which, in his judgment, might be done to the air compressor in use and which would constitute the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control devices or elements of design of the compressor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The manufacturer shall include in the owner's manual the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The statement:</p><p class="depth0">Tampering With Noise Control System Prohibited</p><p class="depth0">Federal law prohibits the following acts or the causing thereof:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The removal or rendering inoperative by any persons, other than for purposes of maintenance, repair, or replacement, of any devices or element of design incorporated into any new compressor for the purpose of noise control prior to its sale or delivery to the ultimate purchaser or while it is in use; or (2) the use of the compressor after such device or element of design has been removed or rendered inoperative by any person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The statement:</p><p class="depth0">Among those acts included in the prohibition against tampering are the acts listed below.

Immediately following this statement, the manufacturer shall include the list developed under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Any act included in the list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is presumed to constitute tampering; however, in any case in which a proscribed act has been committed and it can be shown that such act resulted in no increase in the sound level of the compressor or that the compressor still meets the noise emission standard of Sec. 204.52, such set will not constitute tampering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The provisions of this section are not intended to preclude any State or local jurisdiction from adopting and enforcing its own prohibitions against the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control systems on compressors subject to this part.

Sec. 204.58-3  Instructions for maintenance, use, and repair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> The manufacturer shall provide to the ultimate purchaser of each portable air compressor covered by this part written instructions for the proper maintenance, use, and repair of the compressor in order to provide reasonable assurance of the elimination or minimization of noise emission degradation throughout the life of the compressor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer shall provide to the ultimate purchaser of each portable air compressor covered by this part written instructions for the proper maintenance, use, and repair of the compressor in order to provide reasonable assurance of the elimination or minimization of noise emission degradation throughout the life of the compressor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of the instructions is to inform purchasers and mechanics of those acts necessary to reasonably assure that degradation of noise emission levels is eliminated or minimized during the life of the compressor. Manufacturers should prepare the instructions with this purpose in mind. The instructions should be clear and, to the extent practicable, written in non-technical language.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The instructions must not be used to secure an unfair competitive advantage. They should not restrict replacement equipment to original equipment or service to dealer service. Manufacturers who so restrict replacement equipment must make public any performance specifications on such equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of encouraging proper maintenance, the manufacturer shall provide a record or log book which shall contain a performance schedule for all required noise emission control maintenance. Space shall be provided in this record book so that the purchaser can note what maintenance was done, by whom, where and when.
