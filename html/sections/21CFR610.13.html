Each lot of dried product shall  be tested for residual moisture and shall meet and not exceed  established limits as specified by an approved method on file in the  biologics license application. The test for residual moisture may be  exempted by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research  or the Director, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, when deemed  not necessary for the continued safety, purity, and potency of the  product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records. Appropriate records for residual moisture under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be prepared and maintained as  required by the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 211.188 and 211.194  of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (1) and (2) of this section: Provided, That  notwithstanding any other provision of Subchapter F of this chapter, the  test for pyrogenic substances is not required for the following  products: Products containing formed blood elements; Cryoprecipitate;  Plasma; Source Plasma; Normal Horse Serum; bacterial, viral, and  rickettsial vaccines and antigens; toxoids; toxins; allergenic extracts;  venoms; diagnostic substances and trivalent organic arsenicals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test dose. The test dose for each rabbit shall be at least 3  milliliters per kilogram of body weight of the rabbit and also shall be  at least equivalent proportionately, on a body weight basis, to the  maximum single human dose recommended, but need not exceed 10  milliliters per kilogram of body   weight of the rabbit, except that: (i) Regardless of the human dose  recommended, the test dose per kilogram of body weight of each rabbit  shall be at least 1 milliliter for immune globulins derived from human  blood; (ii) for Streptokinase, the test dose shall be at least  equivalent proportionately, on a body weight basis, to the maximum  single human dose recommended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test procedure, results, and interpretation; standards to be  met.

If the lot fails to meet the test requirements  prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the test may be repeated  once using five other rabbits. The temperature rises recorded for all  eight rabbits used in testing shall be included in determining whether  the requirements are met. The lot meets the requirements for absence of  pyrogens if not more than three of the eight rabbits show individual  rises in temperature of 0.6 [deg]C or more, and if the sum of the eight  individual maximum temperature rises does not exceed 3.7 [deg]C.
