                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibited nonbanking activities and acquisitions. Except as  provided in Sec. 225.22 of this subpart, a bank holding company or a  subsidiary may not engage in, or acquire or control, directly or  indirectly, voting securities or assets of a company engaged in, any  activity other than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries  authorized under the BHC Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An activity that the Board determines to be so closely related  to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident  thereto, including any incidental activities that are necessary to carry  on such an activity, if the bank holding company has obtained the prior  approval of the Board for that activity in accordance with the  requirements of this regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exempt bank holding companies. The following bank holding  companies are exempt from the provisions of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Family-owned companies. Any company that is a ``company covered  in 1970'' (as defined in section 2(b) of the BHC Act), more than 85  percent of the voting securities of which was collectively owned on June  30, 1968, and continuously thereafter, by members of the same family (or  their spouses) who are lineal descendants of common ancestors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Labor, agricultural, and horticultural organizations. Any  company that was on January 4, 1977, both a bank holding company and a  labor, agricultural, or horticultural organization exempt from taxation  under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Companies granted hardship exemption. Any bank holding company  that has controlled only one bank since before July 1, 1968, and that  has been granted an exemption by the Board under section 4(d) of the BHC  Act, subject to any conditions imposed by the Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Companies granted exemption on other grounds. Any company that  acquired control of a bank before December 10, 1982, without the Board's  prior approval under section 3 of the BHC Act, on the basis of a narrow  interpretation of the term demand deposit or commercial loan, if the  Board has determined that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coverage of the company as a bank holding company under this  subpart would be unfair or represent an unreasonable hardship; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exclusion of the company from coverage under this part is  consistent with the purposes of the BHC Act and section 106 of the Bank  Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971, 1972(1)). The  provisions of Sec. 225.4 of subpart A of this part do not apply to a  company exempt under this paragraph.</p>
