                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A party adversely affected by a decision or approval of the  authorized officer may appeal that decision to the Interior Board of  Land Appeals as set forth in part 4 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All decisions and approvals of the authorized officer under this  part shall remain effective pending appeal unless the Interior Board of  Land Appeals determines otherwise upon consideration of the standards  stated in this paragraph. The provisions of 43 CFR 4.21(a) shall not  apply to any decision or approval of the authorized officer under this  part. A petition for a stay of a decision or approval of the authorized  officer shall be filed with the Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office  of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the Interior, and shall show  sufficient justification based on the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or  denied,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The likelihood of irreparable harm to the appellant or resources  if the stay is not granted, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the public interest favors granting the stay.  Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the discretionary authority of  the authorized officer to stay the effectiveness of a decision subject  to appeal pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section upon a request by an  adversely affected party or on the authorized officer's own initiative.  If the authorized officer denies such a request, the requester can  petition for a stay of the denial decision by filing a petition with the  Interior Board of Land Appeals that addresses the standards described  above in this paragraph.
