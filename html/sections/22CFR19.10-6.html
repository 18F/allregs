                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annuity of recalled participant. Any participant who is recalled to the Service under section 308 of the Act, shall, while serving, be entitled in lieu of annuity to the full salary of the class in which serving. During such service, the recalled annuitant shall make contributions to the Fund under section 805(a) of the Act. If a share of the annuity is being paid as a pension to a former spouse under Sec. 19.9, that share shall be deducted from the salary of the recalled annuitant during the period of the recall service. Upon reversion of the annuitant to retired status, any pension payable to a former spouse that was being deducted from the salary of the principal shall again be deducted from the annuity of the principal which shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the recall service lasts less than one year, a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall period will be refunded under Sec. 19.13 and the former annuity will be resumed at the previous rate adjusted by any cost-of-living increases that became effective during recall service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the recall service lasts between one and five years, the annuitant will be entitled to elect benefits under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or receive both the former annuity adjusted by cost-of-living increases and a supplemental annuity computed under Sec. 19.10 on the basis of service credit and average salary earned during the recall period, irrespective of the number of years of service credit previously earned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the recall service lasts five years or more, the annuitant will be entitled to recomputation of the annuity as if there had been no previous retirement, or elect benefits under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An annuitant may receive credit in any computation under paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section for any Federal service performed subsequent to the separation upon which the original annuity was computed provided a special contribution is made for such service under section 805 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An annuitant entitled to a supplemental annuity under paragraph (a)(3) of this section or a recomputated annuity under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is obligated, in the absence of a court order or spousal agreement to the contrary, to have those annuities reduced to provide the benefits described in Sec. 19.8 to any spouse or former spouse to whom married during any portion of the recall service. An annuitant must accept a reduction of 10 percent of his/her supplemental annuity in order to provide a supplemental survivor annuity to a spouse or former

spouse. The maximum supplemental survivor annuity equals 55 percent of the supplemental annuity. If, upon reversion to retired status, an annuitant has a former spouse entitled to a pro rata share or some other share of the supplemental survivor annuity, but no spouse, the appropriate share of the supplemental annuity shall be reduced by 10 percent to provide such former spouse a share of the maximum supplemental survivor annuity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Survivor benefit for death during recall service. (1) If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity under Sec. 19.10-2 dies in service after being recalled and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity based on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been resumed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. If such death occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor annuity computed and paid under Sec. 19.10-6a(5) as if the recall service had otherwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his/her annuity determined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other survivor benefit under Sec. 19.11, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under Sec. 19.11-2 or Sec. 19.11-3 on the basis of the total service of the annuitant. In the event such an annuitant is survived both by a spouse and such a former spouse, the former spouse will be entitled to a pro rata share of any refund or supplemental survivor benefit under this section computed on the basis of total service during the recall period and months of marriage during such period. If the surviving spouse and surviving former spouse elect different benefits under this paragraph, the former spouse will receive the pro rata share of the benefit he/she elects and the spouse will receive the reciprocal share of the benefit he/she elects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an annuitant entitled to a reduced annuity under Sec. 19.10-2 dies in service after being recalled and is survived by a spouse or former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity based on the service of such annuitant, such survivor annuity shall be computed as if the recall service had otherwise terminated on the day of death and the annuity of the deceased had been resumed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. If such death occurs after the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility for a supplemental annuity, a surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who was married to the participant at any time during a period of recall service shall be entitled to elect, in addition to any other benefits and in lieu of a refund of retirement contributions made during the recall service, a supplemental survivor annuity computed and paid under Sec. 19.10-6a(5) as if the recall service had otherwise terminated. If the annuitant had completed sufficient recall service to attain eligibility to have his/her annuity determined anew, a surviving spouse or such a surviving former spouse may elect, in lieu of any other survivor benefit under Sec. 19.11, to have the rights of the annuitant redetermined and to receive a survivor annuity computed under Sec. 19.11-2 or Sec. 19.11-3 on the basis of the total service of the annuitant. In the event such an annuitant is survived both by a spouse and such a former spouse, the former spouse will be entitled to a pro rata share of any refund or supplemental survivor benefit under this section computed on the basis of total service during the recall period and months of marriage during such period. If the surviving spouse and surviving former spouse elect different benefits under this paragraph, the former spouse will receive the pro rata share of the benefit he/she elects and the spouse will receive the reciprocal share of the benefit he/she elects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event an annuitant dies during recall service and is survived by a former spouse to whom not married during any period of the recall service, such former spouse will not be entitled to any benefits based on the recall service.</p>
