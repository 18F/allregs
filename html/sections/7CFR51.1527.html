Size may   also be shown in terms of maximum number of fruit for a specified  weight, such as ``8 per pound,'' ``6.4 per pound'' or ``7\2/3\ per  pound'' or by a count-size designation based on the number of fruits  contained in a 10 pound sample with the designation rounded to an  applicable number which is divisible by 5 (example: 40 size, 45 size, 50  size, 55 size, etc.).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> California peach boxes, lug boxes and small consumer packages.  In layer-packed California peach boxes or lug boxes, and in small layer  packed consumer packages, the count of the entire contents shall be  marked on the package. The number of plums or prunes in California peach  boxes or lug boxes shall not vary more than 4 from the number indicated  on the package. Loose filled consumer packs not in a master container  shall have a count-size marked on the package or on a tag closure.  Master containers of loose filled consumer packages shall have a count- size marked on the package describing the size of plums or prunes within  the container.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Face and fill packs in cartons and lug boxes. In face and fill  packs in cartons and lug boxes the number of rows in the face shall be  marked on the packages, as ``6 row,'' ``8 row,'' etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sizing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Not more than 5 percent, by count, of the plums or  prunes in any package may vary more than one-fourth inch in diameter,  except that not more than 5 percent, by count, of the plums or prunes 2- 1/4 inches or larger in diameter and packed in loose or volume filled  containers may vary more than three-eighths inch in diameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When size is indicated in terms of minimum diameter, not more  than 5 percent, by count, of the fruit in any package may be smaller  than the size marked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tolerance for standard pack. In order to allow for variations  incident to proper sizing and packing, not more than 10 percent, by  count, of the packages in any lot may fail to meet the requirements for  standard pack.</p><p class="depth2">Definitions</p>
