                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contents. A complete air cargo manifest shall list all cargo  laden, and show for each item the air waybill number, or marks and  numbers on packages and the type of goods carried. If an item does not  require a Shipper's Export Declaration, it shall be noted on the air  cargo manifest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Shipments on an air waybill. A copy of each air waybill on which  shipments are listed may be attached to the air cargo manifest, and the  number of the air waybill may be listed on the air cargo manifest.

This subsection applies only to direct  departures of shipments requiring a Shipper's Export Declaration. A copy  of each declaration may be attached to the air cargo manifest, and the  number of each declaration shall be listed on the air cargo manifest in  the column for air waybill numbers. The statement ``Cargo as per Export  Declarations Attached'' must appear on the manifest if this is done.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Statement required.

Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an  appropriate official of each commercial aircraft (carrier) departing  from the United States en route to any port or place outside the United  States must transmit to the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS;  referred to in this section as the Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  system), the electronic data interchange system approved by CBP for such  transmissions, an electronic passenger departure manifest covering all  passengers checked in for the flight. A passenger manifest must be  transmitted separately from a crew member manifest required under Sec.  122.75b if transmission is in U.S. EDIFACT format. The passenger  manifest must be transmitted to the CBP system at the place and time  specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in the manner set forth  under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em>, (B), (C), or (D) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> by means  of a non-interactive electronic transmission system approved by CBP. The  carrier may make a single, complete batch manifest transmission  containing the data required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for  all passengers checked in for the flight or two or more partial batch  manifest transmissions, each containing the required data for the  identified passengers and which together cover all passengers checked in  for the flight. After receipt of the manifest information, the CBP  system will perform an initial security vetting of the data and send to  the carrier by a non-interactive transmission method a ``not-cleared''  instruction for passengers identified as requiring additional security  analysis and a ``selectee'' instruction for passengers requiring  secondary screening (e.g., additional examination of the person and/or  his baggage) under applicable Transportation Security Administration  (TSA) requirements. The carrier must designate as a ``selectee'' any  passenger so identified during initial security vetting, in accordance  with applicable TSA requirements. The carrier must not issue a boarding  pass to, or load the baggage of, any passenger subject to the ``not- cleared'' instruction and must contact the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) to seek resolution of the ``not-cleared''  instruction by providing, if necessary, additional relevant information  relative to the ``not-cleared'' passenger. TSA will notify the carrier  if a ``not-cleared'' passenger is cleared for boarding or downgraded to  ``selectee'' status based on the additional security analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Interactive batch transmission option. A carrier, upon obtaining  CBP certification, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this  section, may make manifest transmissions by means of an interactive  electronic transmission system configured for batch transmission of data  and receipt from the CBP system of appropriate messages. A carrier  operating under this paragraph must make manifest transmissions by  transmitting a single, complete batch manifest containing the data  required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section for all passengers  checked in for the flight or two or more partial batch manifests, each  containing the required data for the identified passengers and which  together cover all passengers checked in for the flight. In the case of  connecting passengers arriving at the connecting   airport already in possession of boarding passes for a flight departing  from the United States whose data have not been collected by the  carrier, the carrier must transmit required manifest data for these  passengers when they arrive at the gate, or some other suitable place  designated by the carrier, for the flight. After receipt of the manifest  information, the CBP system will perform an initial security vetting of  the data and send to the carrier by interactive electronic transmission,  as appropriate, a ``cleared'' instruction for passengers not matching  against the watch list, a ``not-cleared'' instruction for passengers  identified as requiring additional security analysis, and a ``selectee''  instruction for passengers who require secondary screening (e.g.,  additional examination of the person and/or his baggage) under  applicable TSA requirements. The carrier must designate as a  ``selectee'' any passenger so identified during initial security  vetting, in accordance with applicable TSA requirements. The carrier  must not issue a boarding pass to, or load the baggage of, any passenger  subject to a ``not-cleared'' instruction and, in the case of connecting  passengers (as described in this paragraph), the carrier must not board  or load the baggage of any such passenger until the CBP system returns a  ``cleared'' or ``selectee'' response for that passenger. Where a  ``selectee'' instruction is received for a connecting passenger, the  carrier must ensure that such passenger undergoes secondary screening  before boarding. The carrier must seek resolution of a ``not-cleared''  instruction by contacting TSA and providing, if necessary, additional  relevant information relative to the ``not-cleared'' passenger. Upon  completion of the additional security analysis, TSA will notify the  carrier if a ``not-cleared'' passenger is cleared for boarding or  downgraded to ``selectee'' status based on the additional security  analysis. No later than 30 minutes after the securing of the aircraft,  the carrier must transmit to the CBP system a message reporting any  passengers who checked in but were not onboard the flight. The message  must identify the passengers by a unique identifier selected or devised  by the carrier or by specific passenger data (name) and may contain the  unique identifiers or data for all passengers onboard the flight or for  only those passengers who checked in but were not onboard the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interactive individual passenger information transmission  option. A carrier, upon obtaining CBP certification, in accordance with  paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section, may make manifest transmissions  by means of an interactive electronic transmission system configured for  transmitting individual passenger data for each passenger and for  receiving from the CBP system appropriate messages. A carrier operating  under this paragraph must make such transmissions as individual  passengers check in for the flight or, in the case of connecting  passengers arriving at the connecting airport already in possession of  boarding passes for a flight departing from the United States whose data  have not been collected by the carrier, as these connecting passengers  arrive at the gate, or some other suitable place designated by the  carrier for the flight. With each transmission of manifest information  by the carrier, the CBP system will perform an initial security vetting  of the data and send to the carrier by interactive electronic  transmission, as appropriate, a ``cleared'' instruction for passengers  not matching against the watch list, a ``not-cleared'' instruction for  passengers identified during initial security vetting as requiring  additional security analysis, and a ``selectee'' instruction for  passengers requiring secondary screening (e.g., additional examination  of the person and/or his baggage) under applicable TSA requirements. The  carrier must designate as a ``selectee'' any passenger so identified  during initial security vetting, in accordance with applicable TSA  requirements. The carrier must not issue a boarding pass to, or load the  baggage of, any passenger subject to a ``not-cleared'' instruction and,  in the case of connecting passengers (as described in this paragraph),  must not board or load the baggage of any such passenger until the CBP  system returns a ``cleared'' or ``selectee'' response for that  passenger. Where a ``selectee'' instruction is received for a connecting  passenger, the carrier must ensure that   such passenger undergoes secondary screening before boarding. The  carrier must seek resolution of a ``not-cleared'' instruction by  contacting TSA and providing, if necessary, additional relevant  information relative to the ``not-cleared'' passenger. Upon completion  of the additional security analysis, TSA will notify the carrier if a  ``not-cleared'' passenger is cleared for boarding or downgraded to  ``selectee'' status based on the additional security analysis. No later  than 30 minutes after the securing of the aircraft, the carrier must  transmit to the CBP system a message reporting any passengers who  checked in but were not onboard the flight. The message must identify  the passengers by a unique identifier selected or devised by the carrier  or by specific passenger data (name) and may contain the unique  identifiers or data for all passengers onboard the flight or for only  those passengers who checked in but were not onboard the flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Combined use of interactive methods. If certified to do so, a  carrier may make transmissions under both paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(B) and  (C) of this section for a particular flight or for different flights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Certification. Before making any required manifest transmissions  under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, a carrier must  subject its electronic transmission system to CBP testing, and CBP must  certify that the carrier's system is then presently capable of  interactively communicating with the CBP system for effective  transmission of manifest data and receipt of appropriate messages under  those paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Place and time for submission. The appropriate official  specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (carrier) must transmit  the departure manifest or manifest data as required under paragraphs  (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section to the CBP system (CBP Data Center,  CBP Headquarters), in accordance with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For manifests transmitted under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B)  of this section, no later than 30 minutes prior to the securing of the  aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(C)</em> of this section, no later than the securing of the  aircraft; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For an aircraft operating as an air ambulance in service of a  medical emergency, no later than 30 minutes after departure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(iv)</em>, (ix), and (xi) of this  section must be included on the manifest only on or after October 4,  2005:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Full name (last, first, and, if available, middle);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date of birth;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gender (F = female; M = male);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Citizenship;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Status on board the aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Travel document type (e.g., P = passport; A = alien  registration card);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Passport number, if a passport is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Passport country of issuance, if a passport is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Passport expiration date, if a passport is required;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Alien registration number, where applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Passenger Name Record locator, if available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> International Air Transport Association (IATA) departure port  code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> IATA code of port/place of final arrival (foreign port code);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> Airline carrier code;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Flight number; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xvi)</em> Date of aircraft departure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exception.

The carrier collecting the information described in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section is responsible for comparing the travel  document presented by the passenger with the travel document information  it is transmitting to CBP in accordance with this section in order to  ensure that the information is correct, the document appears to be   valid for travel purposes, and the passenger is the person to whom the  travel document was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Sharing of manifest information. Information contained in the  passenger manifest required under this section that is received by CBP  electronically may, upon request, be shared with other Federal agencies  for the purpose of protecting national security. CBP may also share such  information as otherwise authorized by law.
