NAF employees are provided workers' compensation benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) (33 U.S.C. 901, et seq.) as extended by the Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities Act (5 U.S.C. 8171-8173). For injuries suffered by NAFI employees in the course and scope of their employment where third parties are responsible for the injuries, the employing NAFIs are entitled to recover from the responsible third parties for the compensation and medical benefits paid to the injured employees (33 U.S.C. 933). Third party claims are pursued on behalf of employing NAFIs by the servicing staff judge advocate. A NAFI also has the right of offset against an employee's pay amounts recovered directly by the employee from third parties as provided in the LHWCA.</p>
