                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Taxable years to which a loss may be carried.

However,  see Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5), which does not allow the net operating loss  deduction in computing real estate investment trust taxable income for  taxable years ending before October 5, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A net operating loss sustained by a qualified real estate  investment trust in a qualified taxable year ending after December 31,  1972, shall be carried over to the 15 succeeding taxable years. However,  see Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A net operating loss sustained by a qualified real estate  investment trust in a qualified taxable year ending before January 1,  1973, shall be carried over to 8 succeeding taxable years. However, see  Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>, with respect to a net operating loss sustained  in a taxable year ending before January 1, 1976.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A net operating loss sustained in a taxable year ending after  December 31, 1975, for which the taxpayer is not a qualified real estate  investment trust generally may be carried over to the 15 succeeding  taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A net operating loss sustained in a taxable year ending  before January 1, 1986, for which the taxpayer is not a qualified real  estate investment trust generally may be a net operating loss carryover  to each of the 5 succeeding taxable years. However, where the loss was a  net operating loss carryback to one or more qualified taxable years, the  net operating loss, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this  section shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Carried over to the 15 succeeding taxable years if the loss  could be a net operating loss carryover to a taxable year ending in  1981, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Carried over to the 5, 6, 7, or 8 succeeding taxable years if  paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining whether a net operating loss could  be a carryover to a taxable year ending in 1981 under paragraph  (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section or, where paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this  section does not apply, to determine the actual carryover period under  paragraph (a)(7)(i)(B) of this section, the net operating loss shall  have a carryover period of 5 years, and such period shall be increased  (to a number not greater than 8) by the number of qualified taxable  years to which such loss was a net operating loss carryback; however,  where the taxpayer acted so as to cause itself to cease to be a  qualified real estate investment trust and the principal purpose for  such action was to secure the benefit of the allowance of a net  operating loss carryover under section 172(b)(1)(B), the net operating  loss carryover period shall be limited to 5 years. However, see Sec.  1.857-2(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A qualified taxable year is a taxable year preceding or  following the taxable year of the net operating loss, for purposes of  section 172(b)(1), even though the loss may not be carried to, or  allowed as a deduction in, such qualified taxable year. Thus, a  qualified taxable year ending before October 5, 1976 (for which no net  operating loss   deduction is allowable) is nevertheless a preceding or following taxable  year for purposes of section 172(b)(1). Moreover, a qualified taxable  year ending after October 4, 1976 (to which a net operating loss cannot  be carried back because of section 172(b)(1)(E)) is nevertheless a  preceding taxable year for purposes of section 172(b)(1). For purposes  of determining, under section 172(b)(2), the balance of the loss  available as a carryback or carryover to other taxable years, however,  the net operating loss is not reduced on account of such qualified  taxable year being a preceding or following taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 1.172-2  and 1.172-5:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The term qualified real estate investment trust means, with  respect to any taxable year, a real estate investment trust within the  meaning of part II of subchapter M which is taxable for such year under  that part as a real estate investment trust, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The term qualified taxable year means a taxable year for which  the taxpayer is a qualified real estate investment trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X was a qualified real estate investment trust  for the taxable years ending on December 31, 1972, and December 31,  1973. X was not a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable  years ending on December 31, 1971, and December 31, 1974. X sustained a  net operating loss for the taxable year ending on December 31, 1974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> of this section the applicable carryover period  is 15 years (provided that X did not act so as to cause itself to cease  to qualify as a real estate investment trust for the principal purpose  of securing the benefit of a net operating loss carryover under section  172 (b)(1)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in example (1)  except that the taxable year ending December 31, 1973, was not a  qualified taxable year for X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section,  which, in this case, is 6 years (provided that the principal purpose for  X acting so as to cause itself to cease to qualify as a real estate  investment trust was not to secure the benefit of the allowance of a net  operating loss carryover under section 172 (b)(1)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cross references. See Sec. Sec. 1.172-2(c) and 1.172-5(a)(5)  for the computation of the net operating loss of a qualified real estate  investment trust for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, and  the amount of a net operating loss which is absorbed when carried over  to a qualified taxable year ending after October 4, 1976. See Sec.  1.857-2(a)(5), which provides that for a taxable year ending before  October 5, 1976, the net operating loss deduction is not allowed in  computing the real estate investment   trust taxable income of a qualified real estate investment trust.
