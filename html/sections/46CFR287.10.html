                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Withdrawals for obligations or liquidation. (1) Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, after having been executed by the taxpayer, shall be forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal, including properly certified invoices or other supporting papers. Such instruments of withdrawal, if payable to the Administration, will be deposited by the Administration for collection, and the proceeds thereof, upon collection, will be credited to the appropriate contract with the Administration; but if drawn to the order of payees other than the Administration, after countersignature on behalf of the Administration, will ordinarily be forwarded to the payees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, after having been executed by the taxpayer, shall be forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal, including properly certified invoices or other supporting papers. Such instruments of withdrawal, if payable to the Administration, will be deposited by the Administration for collection, and the proceeds thereof, upon collection, will be credited to the appropriate contract with the Administration; but if drawn to the order of payees other than the Administration, after countersignature on behalf of the Administration, will ordinarily be forwarded to the payees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount obligated under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the obligor has the entire or a partial interest therein within the scope of section 511 of the Act, may not, so long as the contract or indebtedness continues in full force and effect, be withdrawn except to meet payments due or to become due under such contract or for such liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other withdrawals. Checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal executed by the taxpayer for purposes other than to meet obligations under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels or for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness, whether the taxpayer has the entire or a partial interest therein, shall be drawn by the taxpayer to its own order and forwarded to the Administration in Washington, DC, with appropriate explanation of the purpose of the proposed withdrawal. Such withdrawals may occur by reason of a determination by the Administration that the taxpayer is not entitled to the benefits of section 511 of the Act (see Sec. 287.5), or that a particular deposit has been improperly made (see Sec. 287.13), or by reason of the election of the taxpayer to make such withdrawals. Upon receipt of such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal, the Administration will give notice thereof to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner will advise the Administration of the receipt of the notice and the date it was received. The Administration shall not countersign such checks, drafts, or other instruments of withdrawal or transmit them to the taxpayer until the expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice by the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner or such official of the Internal Revenue Service as he may designate for the purpose consents in writing to earlier countersignature by the Administration and transmittal to the taxpayer. Upon the expiration of such 30-day period, or prior thereto if the aforesaid consent of the Commissioner has been obtained, the Administration will countersign the check, draft, or other instrument of withdrawal and forward it to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inapplicability to certain transactions. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to transactions deemed to be withdrawals by reason of the sale of securities held in the fund for an amount less than the market value thereof at the time of their deposit (see Sec. 287.23), nor to the cancellation of an irrevocable commitment deposited in the fund, upon proof satisfactory to the Administration that the

terms of such commitment have been fully satisfied.</p>
