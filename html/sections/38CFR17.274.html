                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With the exception of services obtained through VA facilities, CHAMPVA is a cost-sharing program in which the cost of covered services is shared with the beneficiary. CHAMPVA pays the CHAMPVA-determined allowable amount less the deductible, if applicable, and less the beneficiary cost share.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the beneficiary cost share, an annual (calendar year) outpatient deductible requirement ($50 per beneficiary or $100 per family) must be satisfied prior to the payment of outpatient benefits. There is no deductible requirement for inpatient services or for services provided through VA facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To provide financial protection against the impact of a long-term illness or injury, a calendar year cost limit or ``catastrophic cap'' has been placed on the beneficiary cost-share amount for covered services and supplies. Credits to the annual catastrophic cap are limited to the applied annual deductible(s) and the beneficiary cost-share amount. Costs above the CHAMPVA-allowable amount, as well as costs associated with non-covered services are not credited to the catastrophic cap computation. After a family has paid the maximum cost-share and deductible amounts for a calendar year, CHAMPVA will pay allowable amounts for the remaining covered services through the end of that calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Through December 31, 2001, the annual cap on cost sharing is $7,500 per CHAMPVA-eligible family.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Effective January 1, 2002, the cap on cost sharing is $3,000 per CHAMPVA-eligible family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the CHAMPVA benefit payment is under $1.00, payment will not be issued. Catastrophic cap and deductible will, however, be credited.
