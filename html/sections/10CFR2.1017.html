                            <p class="depth0">In computing any period of time, the day of the act, event, or  default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not  included. The last day of the period so computed is included unless it  is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday at the place where the action or  event is to occur, in which event the period runs until the end of the  next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor holiday. Whenever a  party, potential party, or interested governmental participant, has the  right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the  service of a notice or other document upon it, one day shall be added to  the prescribed period. If the electronic docket is unavailable for more  than four access hours of any day that would be counted in the  computation of time, that day will not be counted in the computation of  time.
