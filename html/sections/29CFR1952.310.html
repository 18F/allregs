                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan designates the Department of Labor and Industrial  Relations as the agency responsible for administering the plan  throughout the State. It proposes to define the occupational safety and  health issues covered by it as defined by the Secretary of Labor in 29  CFR 1902.2(c)(1). All occupational safety and health standards  promulgated by the U.S. Secretary of Labor will be adopted under the  plan as well as certain standards deemed to be ``as effective as'' the  Federal standards, except those found in 29 CFR parts 1915, 1916, 1917,  and 1918 (ship repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking and longshoring).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within the plan there is the Hawaii Occupational Safety and  Health   Law which became law on May 16, 1972. The law as enacted gives the  Department of Labor and Industrial Relations the authority to inspect  workplaces and to issue citations for the abatement of violations and  there is also included a prohibition against advance notice of such  inspections. The law is also intended to insure employer and employee  representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors and to call  attention to possible violations; notification of employees or their  representatives when no compliance action is taken as a result of  alleged violations; protection of employees against discharge or  discrimination in terms and conditions of employment; adequate  safeguards to protect trade secrets. There is provision made for the  prompt restraint of imminent danger situations and a system of penalties  for violation of the law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan also includes proposed amendments to be considered by  the Hawaii Legislature during its 1974 session amending the Occupational  Safety and Health Law, and related provisions, to bring them into  conformity with the requirements of part 1902.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Hawaii plan includes the following documents as of the date  of approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan description documents, including the Hawaii  Occupational Safety and Health Law, the proposed amendments to the Law  and appendices in three (3) volumes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Letter from Robert K. Hasegawa, Director of the Department of  Labor and Industrial Relations, to Jay Arnoldus, Project Officer, Office  of Federal and State Operations, December 10, 1973, submitting  clarifications to the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Letters from Robert C. Gilkey, Deputy Director of the Department  of Labor and Industrial Relations, to Jay Arnoldus, December 3, 1973 and  December 4, 1973 submitting clarifications and deletion to the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Letters from Robert K. Hasegawa to Gabriel Gillotti, Assistant  Regional Director, January 30, 1973, and June 28, 1973.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Letter from Robert A. Gilkey to John H.
