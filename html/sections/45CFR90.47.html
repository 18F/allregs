No termination shall be based in whole or in part on a finding with respect to any program or activity which does not receive Federal financial assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No action under paragraph (a) of this section may be taken until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The head of the agency involved has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act or the agency's regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thirty days have elapsed after the head of the agency involved has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved.

A deferral may not continue for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the agency. A deferral may not continue for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.
