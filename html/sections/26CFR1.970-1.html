The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation A is a wholly owned subsidiary of  domestic corporation M. Both corporations use the calendar year as the  taxable year. For 1963, A Corporation's subpart F income determined  under section 952 and the regulations thereunder is $35, the total of  its gross receipts and gross amounts referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii)  of this paragraph is $310, its export promotion expenses properly  allocable to its export trade income which constitutes foreign base  company income are $18, its increase in investments in export trade  assets is $32, and its export trade income is $40, of which $30  constitutes foreign base company income and $10 does not constitute  foreign base company income. The subpart F income of A Corporation for  1963 as reduced under section 970(a) is $11, determined as follows:  (i) Subpart F income....................................  ......     $35 (ii) Less: $30 export trade income which constitutes</p><p class="depth0">foreign base company income, but deduction not to</p><p class="depth0">exceed the smallest of the following limitations</p><p class="depth0">(smallest of (a), (b), or (c)):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> 150 percent of allocable export promotion            $27</p><p class="depth0">expenses referred to in subparagraph (2)(i) of this</p><p class="depth0">paragraph (150% of $18)............................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> 10 percent of gross receipts and gross amounts       $31</p><p class="depth0">referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this</p><p class="depth0">paragraph (10% of $310)............................</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount which bears to the increase in                $24     $24</p><p class="depth0">investments in export trade assets ($32) the same</p><p class="depth0">ratio as the export trade income which constitutes</p><p class="depth0">foreign base company income ($30) bears to total</p><p class="depth0">export trade income ($40) (75% [$30/$40] of $32)...</p><p class="depth0">======= (iii) Subpart F income as reduced under section 970(a)..  ......      11</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that A  Corporation's export promotion expenses properly allocable to export  trade income which constitutes foreign base company income are $14  instead of $18. The applicable limitation on the amount deductible from  A Corporation's subpart F income for 1963 is $21 (150% of $14) instead  of $24. The subpart F income as reduced under section 970(a) is $14 ($35  less $21).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the  total amount of A Corporation's gross receipts and gross amounts  referred to in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph is $200 instead of  $310. The applicable limitation on the amount deductible from A  Corporation's subpart F income for 1963 is $20 (10 percent of $200)  instead of $24. The subpart F income as reduced under section 970(a) is  $15 ($35 less $20).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that A  Corporation derives its export trade income which constitutes foreign  base company income of $30 in a service arrangement with M Corporation  under which it receives as a fee 5 percent of the gross receipts from M  Corporation's sales or a minimum fee of $30. Such gross receipts are  $220. The gross amounts taken into account in determining the limitation  under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph are $220. The applicable  limitation on the amount deductible from A Corporation's subpart F  income for 1963 is $22 (10 percent of $220) instead of $24. The subpart  F income as reduced under section 970(a) is $13 ($35 minus $22).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that A  Corporation derives its export trade income which constitutes foreign  base company income of $30 in a service arrangement with M Corporation  under which it receives as a fee 9 percent of the gross receipts from M  Corporation's sales or a maximum fee of $30. Such gross receipts are  $400. In such instance, the limitation under (ii)(b) of example 1 is $40  (10 percent of $400) instead of $31. The applicable limitation on the  amount deductible from A Corporation's subpart F income for 1963 is $24,  the smallest of the three limitations.

The application of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation A, which has one class of stock  outstanding, is a wholly owned subsidiary of domestic corporation M  throughout 1963 and 1964. Both corporations use the calendar year as the  taxable year.

Section 972 is assumed not to apply to A Corporation. For 1964,  A Corporation has a decrease of $8 in investments in export trade  assets. For 1963 and 1964, A Corporation has earnings and profits of $30  (determined under the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph).

Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that on  February 14, 1965, M Corporation sells 25 percent of its stock in A  Corporation to N Corporation. Corporation N is a domestic corporation  which also uses the calendar year as a taxable year. For 1965, A  Corporation has a decrease of $16 in investments in export trade assets.  Corporation A's earnings and profits for 1963 and 1964 (determined under  the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) are $22 ($30 minus  $8).

For purposes of sections 970 through 972 and Secs. 1.970-1 to 1.972-1,  inclusive, export trade assets shall be taken into account on the  following bases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Working capital. Working capital to which section 971(c)(1)  applies shall be taken into account at the adjusted basis of current  assets, determined as of the applicable determination date, less any  current liabilities (except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this  subparagraph).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other export trade assets. Inventory to which section 971(c)(2)  applies, facilities to which section 971(c)(3) applies, and evidences of  indebtedness to which section 971(c)(4) applies, shall be taken into  account at their adjusted bases as of the applicable determination date,  reduced by any liabilities (except as provided in subdivision (iii) of  this subparagraph) to which such property is subject on such date. To be  taken into account under this subparagraph, a liability must constitute  a specific charge against the property involved. Thus, a liability  evidenced by an open account or a liability secured only by the general  credit of the controlled foreign corporation will not be taken into  account. On the other hand, if a liability constitutes a specific charge  against several items of property and cannot definitely be allocated to  any single item of property, the liability shall be apportioned against  each of such items of property in that ratio which the adjusted basis of  such item on the applicable determination date bears to the adjusted  basis of all such items on such date. A liability in excess of the  adjusted basis of the property which is subject to such liability will  not be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the adjusted basis   of other property which is not subject to such liability. See paragraph  (c)(6) of Sec. 1.971-1 for treatment of export trade assets which  constitute working capital to which section 971(c)(1) applies and which  also constitute inventory to which section 971(c)(2) applies or  evidences of indebtedness to which section 971(c)(4) applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of certain liabilities. For purposes of subdivisions  (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, a current liability, or a specific  charge created with respect to any item of property, principally for the  purpose of artificially increasing or decreasing the amount of a  controlled foreign corporation's investments in export trade assets  shall be taken into account in such a manner as to properly reflect the  controlled foreign corporation's investments in export trade assets;  whether a specific charge or current liability is created principally  for such purpose will depend upon all the facts and circumstances of  each case.
