                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will  investigate the preparation by a tax return preparer of a return of tax  under the Internal Revenue Code (Code) or claim for refund of tax under  the Code as described in Sec. 301.7701-15(b)(4) of this chapter, and  will send a report of the examination to the tax return preparer before  the assessment of either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A penalty for understating tax liability due to a position for  which either it was not reasonable to believe that the position would  more likely than not be sustained on its merits under section 6694(a) or  no substantial authority, as applicable (or not a reasonable basis for  disclosed positions); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A penalty for willful understatement of liability or reckless  or intentional disregard of rules or regulations under section 6694(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless the period of limitations (if any) under section 6696(d)  may expire without adequate opportunity for assessment, the IRS will  also send, before assessment of either penalty, a 30-day letter to the  tax return preparer notifying him of the proposed penalty or penalties  and offering an opportunity to the tax return preparer to request  further administrative consideration and a final administrative  determination by the IRS concerning the assessment. If the tax return  preparer then makes a timely request, assessment may not be made until  the IRS makes a final administrative determination adverse to the tax  return preparer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the IRS assesses either of the two penalties described in  section 6694(a) and section 6694(b), it will send to the tax return  preparer a statement of notice and demand, separate from any notice of a  tax deficiency, for payment of the amount assessed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 30 days after the day on which notice and demand of  either of the two penalties described in section 6694(a) and section  6694(b) is made against the tax return preparer, the tax return preparer  must either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pay the entire amount assessed (and may file a claim for refund  of the amount paid at any time not later than 3 years after the date of  payment); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pay an amount which is not less than 15 percent of the entire  amount assessed with respect to each return or claim for refund and file  a claim for refund of the amount paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the tax return preparer pays an amount and files a claim for  refund under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, the IRS may not make,  begin, or prosecute a levy or proceeding in court for collection of the  unpaid remainder of the amount assessed until the later of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A date which is more than 30 days after the earlier of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The day on which the tax return preparer's claim for refund is  denied; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The expiration of 6 months after the day on which the tax return  preparer filed the claim for refund; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Final resolution of any proceeding begun as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The IRS may counterclaim in any proceeding begun as provided in  paragraph (b) of this section for the unpaid remainder of the amount  assessed. Final resolution of a proceeding includes any settlement  between the IRS and the tax return preparer, any final determination by  a court (for which the period for appeal, if any, has expired) and,  generally, the types of determinations provided under section 1313(a)  (relating to taxpayer deficiencies). Notwithstanding section 7421(a)  (relating to suits to restrain assessment or collection), the beginning  of a levy or proceeding in court by the IRS in contravention of  paragraph (a)(5) of this section may be enjoined by a proceeding in the  proper court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparer must bring suit in district court to determine  liability for penalty. The IRS may proceed with collection of the amount  of the penalty not paid   under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section if the preparer fails to  begin a proceeding for refund in the appropriate United States district  court within 30 days after the earlier of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The day on which the preparer's claim for refund filed under  paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section is denied; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The expiration of 6 months after the day on which the preparer  filed the claim for refund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suspension of running of period of limitations on collection.  The running of the period of limitations provided in section 6502 on the  collection by levy or by a proceeding in court of the unpaid amount of a  penalty or penalties described in section 6694(a) or section 6694(b) is  suspended for the period during which the IRS, under paragraph (a)(5) of  this section, may not collect the unpaid amount of the penalty or  penalties by levy or a proceeding in court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable to  returns and claims for refund filed, and advice provided, after December  31, 2008.  [T.D. 9436, 73 FR 78446, Dec. 22, 2008]</p>
