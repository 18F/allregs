                                Sec. 53.91  Charges to be included in sale price.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The ``price'' for which an article is sold includes  the total consideration paid for the article, whether that consideration  is in the form of money, services, or other things. However, for  purposes of the taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code, certain  collateral charges made in connection with the sale of a taxable article  must be included in the taxable sale price, whereas others may be  excluded. Any charge which is required by a manufacturer, producer, or  importer to be paid as a condition of its sale of a taxable article and  which is not attributable to an expense falling within one of the  exclusions provided in section 4216 of the Code or the regulations  thereunder is includable in the taxable sale price. It is immaterial for  this purpose that the charge may be paid to a person other than the  manufacturer, producer, or importer, or that it may be separately billed  to the purchaser as a charge earmarked for expenses incurred or to be  incurred in his behalf, such as charges for demonstration or display of  the article, for sales promotion programs, or otherwise. With respect to  the rules relating to exclusion of charges for local advertising of a  manufacturer's products, see section 4216(e) of the Code and Sec.  53.100. In the case of sales on credit, a carrying, finance, or service  charge is excludable from the sale price if it is reasonably related to  the costs of carrying the deferred portion of the sale price (such as  interest on the deferred portion of the sale price, expenses of  bookkeeping necessary to keep the records of such sales, and expenses of  correspondence and other communication in connection with collection).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tools and dies. Separate charges for tools and dies used in the  manufacture or production of a taxable article are to be included, in  whole or in part, in the sale price on which the tax is based. It is  immaterial whether the charges for such items are billed in a lump sum  or are amortized or allocated to each of the taxable articles. If, at  the termination of a contract to manufacture taxable articles, the tools  and dies used in production pass to the purchaser, only the amount of  depreciation of the tools and dies incurred in production, computed on a  ``production output'' basis, should be included in   the sale price. If the purchaser furnishes the tools and dies, the  amount of the cost thereof, to the extent that such cost has been  depreciated in the production of the taxable articles (computed on a  ``production output'' basis), shall be included in determining the sale  price of the articles for purposes of computing the tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charges for warranty. A charge for a warranty of an article  which the manufacturer, producer, or importer requires the purchaser to  pay in order to obtain the article shall be included in the sale price  of the article on which the tax is computed. On the other hand, a charge  for a warranty of a taxable article paid at the purchaser's option shall  not be included in the sale price for purposes of computing tax thereon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Charges for coverings, containers, and packing. Any charge by  the manufacturer, producer, or importer for coverings and containers of  whatever nature used to pack an article for shipment shall be included  as part of the sale price for the purpose of computing the tax, whether  or not the charges are identified as such on the invoice or are billed  separately. Even though there is an agreement that the manufacturer,  producer, or importer will repay all or a portion of the charge for the  coverings or containers upon the return thereof, the full charge  nevertheless shall be included in the sale price. It is immaterial  whether the charge made at the time of sale is more or less than the  actual value of the covering or container. See Sec. 53.173(b)(4) for  provisions relating to the claiming of a credit or refund in the case of  a price readjustment due to the return or repossession of a covering or  container. Packing charges are to be included in the sale price whether  the charges cover normal packing or special packing services, such as  for extra protection of the article or for odd-lot quantities. This rule  shall apply whether the packing services are initiated by the  manufacturer, producer, or importer or are furnished at the request of  the purchaser and whether the packing is performed by the manufacturer,  producer, or importer or by another person at his request. If the  purchaser supplies packing materials, the fair market value of such  materials must be included in the tax base when computing tax liability  on the sale of the article.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Taxable and nontaxable articles sold as a unit. Where a taxable  article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit,  the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the  unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article. Normally, the  taxable portion of such a unit may be determined by applying to the  manufacturer's sale price of the unit the ratio which the manufacturer's  separate sale price of the taxable article bears to the sum of the sale  prices of both the taxable and nontaxable articles, if such articles are  sold separately by the manufacturer. Where the articles (or either one  of them) are not sold separately by the manufacturer and do not have  established sale prices, the taxable portion is to be determined from a  comparison of the actual costs of the articles to the manufacturer.  Thus, if the cost of the taxable article represents four-fifths of the  total cost of the complete unit, the tax applies to four-fifths of the  price charged by the manufacturer for the unit.  [T.D. ATF-308, 56 FR 303, Jan. 3, 1991, as amended by T.D. ATF-312, 56  FR 31083, July 9, 1991]</p>
