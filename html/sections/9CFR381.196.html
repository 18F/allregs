Thereafter, poultry products processed in  such establishments which are certified and approved in accordance with  paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be eligible, so far as the  regulations in this part are concerned, for importation into the United  States from such foreign country after applicable requirements of this  part have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The determination of acceptability of a foreign poultry  inspection system for purposes of this section shall be based on an  evaluation of the foreign program in accordance with the following  requirements and procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The system shall have a program organized and administered by  the national government of the foreign country. The system as  implemented must provide standards equivalent to those of the Federal  system of poultry inspection in the United States with respect to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Organizational structure and staffing, so as to insure uniform  enforcement of the requisite laws and regulations in all establishments  throughout the system at which poultry products are processed for export  to the United States;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ultimate control and supervision by the national government over  the official activities of all employees or licensees of the system;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The assignment of competent, qualified inspectors;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Authority and responsibility of national inspection officials to  enforce the requisite laws and regulations governing poultry inspection  and to certify or refuse to certify poultry products intended for  export;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Adequate administrative and technical support;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The inspection, sanitation, quality, species verification, and  residue standards applied to products produced in the United States.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Other requirements of adequate inspection service as required by  the regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The legal authority for the system and the regulations  thereunder shall impose requirements equivalent to those governing the  system of poultry inspection organized and maintained in the United  States with respect to:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ante mortem inspection of poultry for slaughter, which shall be  performed by veterinarians or by other employees or licensees of the  system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Post mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of  slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of  the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Official controls by the national government over establishment  construction, facilities, and equipment;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Direct and continuous official supervision of slaughtering of  poultry and processing of poultry products, by the assignment of  inspectors to establishments certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this  section to assure that adulterated or misbranded poultry products are  not processed for export to the United States;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Complete separation of establishments certified under  subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified,  and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation  throughout all certified establishments;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for  sanitary handling of poultry products;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or  removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as  set forth in part 417 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or  the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of  poultry products into the United States may request a determination of  eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which  the foreign poultry inspection system is based and such other  information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters  enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii). Determination of  eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information  presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a  representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs  (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a  country for importation of poultry products into the United States  depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign poultry  inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department,  and the timely submission of such documents and other information  related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system as the  Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations  required by this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure  that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those  applicable to the Federal system in the United States, are being met.  The program as implemented must provide for the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> through (H) of this section are being met:  Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any  establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or  is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United  States;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign  inspection system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his  or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in  paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (a)(2)(ii)(H) of this section, copies  of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department  at the time of the representative's review upon request by that  representative to a responsible foreign inspection official: Provided,  that such reports are not required during a period when the  establishment is not operating or not engaged in producing products for  exportation to the United States.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Random sampling and testing at the point of slaughter of  carcasses, including internal organs and fat, for residues identified by  the exporting country's inspection authorities or by this Agency as  potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical  techniques approved by the Administrator: Provided, that such testing is  required only on samples taken of carcasses from which poultry or  poultry products intended for importation into the United States are  produced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Only those establishments that are determined and certified to  the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection  system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and  (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into  the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the  Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program  representatives at times prearranged with the foreign meat inspection  system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed  annually.   Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator  may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the  importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply  with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this  section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The  Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government  of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay  in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of  adulterated or misbranded product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a new establishment or any establishment for which  information from last year's electronic certification or paper  certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain:  The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name,  address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title;  the foreign official's signature (for paper certificates only); the type  of operation(s) conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter,  processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's  eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)).  Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the  species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the  process category).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the establishment information provided on the preceding  year's electronic foreign establishment certification or paper  certificate, as required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has not  changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date, the  foreign country, the foreign establishment's name, the foreign  official's title and signature (for paper certificates only).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Poultry products from foreign countries not listed in paragraph  (b) of this section are not eligible for importation into the United  States, except as provided by Sec. Sec. 381.207 and 381.209. The  listing of any foreign country under this section may be withdrawn  whenever it shall be determined by the Administrator that the system of  poultry inspection maintained by such foreign country does not assure  compliance with requirements equivalent to all the requirements of the  Act and the regulations as applied to official establishments in the  United States; or that reliance cannot be placed upon certificates  required under this subpart from authorities of such foreign country; or  that, for lack of current information concerning the system of poultry  inspection being maintained by such foreign country, such foreign  country should be required to reestablish its eligibility for listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It has been determined that poultry products from the following  countries, covered by foreign poultry inspection certificates of the  country of origin as required by Sec. 381.197, are eligible under the  regulations in this subpart for entry into the United States, after  inspection and marking as required by the applicable provisions of this  subpart: \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Listing of any country in this section does not relieve the  poultry products of such country from applicable requirements under  other Federal laws.
