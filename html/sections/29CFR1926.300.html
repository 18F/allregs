                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Condition of tools. All hand and power tools and similar  equipment, whether furnished by the employer or the employee, shall be  maintained in a safe condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Guarding. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When power operated tools are designed to  accommodate guards, they shall be equipped with such guards when in use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Belts, gears, shafts, pulleys, sprockets, spindles, drums, fly  wheels, chains, or other reciprocating, rotating or moving parts of  equipment shall be guarded if such parts are exposed to contact by  employees or otherwise create a hazard. Guarding shall meet the  requirements as set forth in American National Standards Institute,  B15.1-1953 (R1958), Safety Code for Mechanical Power-Transmission  Apparatus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Types of guarding. One or more methods of machine guarding shall  be provided to protect the operator and other employees in the machine  area from hazards such as those created by point of operation, ingoing  nip points, rotating parts, flying chips and sparks. Examples of  guarding methods are--barrier guards, two-hand tripping devices,  electronic safety devices, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Point of operation guarding. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Point of operation is the area  on a machine where work is actually performed upon the material being  processed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The point of operation of machines whose operation exposes an  employee to injury, shall be guarded. The guarding device shall be in  conformity with any appropriate standards therefor, or, in the absence  of applicable specific standards, shall be so designed and constructed  as to prevent the operator from having any part of his body in the  danger zone during the operating cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special handtools for placing and removing material shall be  such as to permit easy handling of material without the operator placing  a hand in the danger zone. Such tools shall not be in lieu of other  guarding required by this section, but can only be used to supplement  protection provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The following are some of the machines which usually require  point of operation guarding:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Guillotine cutters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Shears.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Alligator shears.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Power presses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Milling machines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Power saws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Jointers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Portable power tools.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Forming rolls and calenders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exposure of blades. When the periphery of the blades of a fan is  less than 7 feet (2.128 m) above the floor or working level, the blades  shall be guarded. The guard shall have openings no larger than \1/2\  inch (1.27 cm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Anchoring fixed machinery. Machines designed for a fixed  location shall be securely anchored to prevent walking or moving.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Guarding of abrasive wheel machinery--exposure adjustment.  Safety guards of the types described in paragraphs (b)   (8) and (9) of this section, where the operator stands in front of the  opening, shall be constructed so that the peripheral protecting member  can be adjusted to the constantly decreasing diameter of the wheel. The  maximum angular exposure above the horizontal plane of the wheel spindle  as specified in paragraphs (b) (8) and (9) of this section shall never  be exceeded, and the distance between the wheel periphery and the  adjustable tongue or the end of the peripheral member at the top shall  never exceed \1/4\ inch (0.635 cm). (See Figures I-1 through I-6.)

The angular exposure of the grinding  wheel periphery and sides for safety guards used on machines known as  bench and floor stands should not exceed 90[deg] or one-fourth of the  periphery. This exposure shall begin at a point not more than 65[deg]  above the horizontal plane of the wheel spindle. (See Figures I-7 and I- 8 and paragraph (b)(7) of this section.)

The maximum angular exposure of the  grinding wheel periphery and sides for safety guards used on cylindrical  grinding machines shall not exceed 180[deg]. This exposure shall begin  at a point not more than 65[deg] above the horizontal plane of the wheel  spindle. (See Figures I-11 and I-12 and paragraph (b)(7) of this  section.) [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07MR96.005</p><p class="depth0">Figure I-11 Figure I-12</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Personal protective equipment. Employees using hand and power  tools and exposed to the hazard of falling, flying, abrasive, and  splashing objects, or exposed to harmful dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, or  gases shall be provided with the particular personal protective  equipment necessary to protect them from the hazard. All personal  protective equipment shall meet the requirements and be maintained  according to subparts D and E of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Switches. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All hand-held powered platen sanders, grinders  with wheels 2-inch diameter or less, routers, planers, laminate  trimmers, nibblers, shears, scroll saws, and jigsaws with blade shanks  one-fourth of an inch wide or less may be equipped with only a positive  ``on-off'' control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All hand-held powered drills, tappers, fastener drivers,  horizontal, vertical, and angle grinders with wheels greater than 2  inches in diameter, disc sanders, belt sanders, reciprocating saws,  saber saws, and other similar operating powered tools shall be equipped  with a momentary contact ``on-off'' control and may have a lock-on  control provided that turnoff can be accomplished by a single motion of  the same finger or fingers that turn it on.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> All other hand-held powered tools, such as circular saws, chain  saws, and percussion tools without positive accessory holding means,  shall be equipped with a constant pressure switch that will shut off the  power when the pressure is released.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The requirements of this paragraph shall become effective on  July 15, 1972.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exception: This paragraph does not apply to concrete vibrators,  concrete breakers, powered tampers, jack hammers, rock drills, and  similar hand operated power tools.
