                            <p class="depth0">A decision to mitigate a penalty or to cancel a claim for liquidated  damages upon condition that a stated amount is paid will be effective  for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of  such decision unless the decision itself prescribes a different  effective period. If payment of the stated amount is not made or a  petition or a supplemental petition is not filed in accordance with  regulation, the full penalty or claim for liquidated damages will be  deemed applicable and will be enforced by promptly transmitting the  matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the  appropriate office of the Chief Counsel for preparation for referral to  the Department of Justice unless other action has been directed by the  Commissioner of Customs. Any such case may also be the basis for a  sanction action commenced in accordance with regulations in this  chapter.</p>
