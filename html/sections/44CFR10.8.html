                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The first step in applying the NEPA process is to determine whether  to prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact  statement. Early determination will help ensure that necessary  environmental documentation is prepared and integrated into the  decision-making process. Environmental impact statements will be  prepared for all major Agency actions (see 40 CFR 1508.18) significantly  (see 40 CFR 1508.27) affecting the quality of the human environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In determining whether to prepare an environmental impact  statement (EIS) the Regional Administrator will first determine whether  the proposal is one which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Normally requires an environmental impact statement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normally does not require either an environmental impact  statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Actions that normally require an EIS. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In some cases, it will  be readily apparent that a proposed action will have significant impact  on the environment. In that event, the Regional Administrator will,  pursuant to Sec. 10.9(g) of this part, submit the notice of preparation  of an environmental impact statement to the Environmental Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To assist in determining those actions that normally do require  an environmental impact statement, the following criteria apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an action will result in an extensive change in land use or  the commitment of a large amount of land;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an action will result in a land use change which is  incompatible with the existing or planned land use of the surrounding  area;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If many people will be affected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the environmental impact of the project is likely to be  controversial;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If an action will affect, in large measure, wildlife populations  and their habitats, important natural resources, floodplains, wetlands,  estuaries, beaches, dunes, unstable soils, steep slopes, aquifer  recharge areas, or delicate or rare ecosystems, including endangered  species;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> If an action will result in a major adverse impact upon air or  water quality;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If an action will adversely affect a property listed on the  National Register of Historic Places or eligible for listing on the  Register if, after consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic  Preservation an environmental assessment is not deemed sufficient;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> If an action is one of several actions underway or planned  for an area and the cumulative impact of these projects is considered  significant in terms of the above criteria;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> If an action holds potential for threat or hazard to the  public; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> If an action is similar to previous actions determined to  require an environmental impact statement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any case involving an action that normally does require an  environmental impact statement, the Regional Administrator may prepare  an environmental assessment to determine if an environmental impact  statement is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statutory exclusions. The following actions are statutorily  excluded from NEPA and the preparation of environmental impact  statements and environmental assessments by section 316 of   the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  (Stafford Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5159;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Action taken or assistance provided under sections 402, 403,  407, or 502 of the Stafford Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Action taken or assistance provided under section 406 of the  Stafford Act that has the effect of restoring facilities substantially  as they existed before a major disaster or emergency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Categorical Exclusions (CATEXs). CEQ regulations at 40 CFR  1508.4 provide for the categorical exclusion of actions that do not  individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human  environment and for which, therefore, neither an environmental  assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Full  implementation of this concept will help FEMA avoid unnecessary or  duplicate effort and concentrate resources on significant environmental  issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria. The criteria used for determination of those  categories of actions that normally do not require either an  environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minimal or no effect on environmental quality;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No significant change to existing environmental conditions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No significant cumulative environmental impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> List of exclusion categories. FEMA has determined that the  following categories of actions have no significant effect on the human  environment and are, therefore, categorically excluded from the  preparation of environmental impact statements and environmental  assessments except where extraordinary circumstances as defined in  paragraph (d)(5) of this section exist. If the action is of an emergency  nature as described in Sec. 316 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5159),  it is statutorily excluded and is noted with [SE].</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Administrative actions such as personnel actions, travel,  procurement of supplies, etc., in support of normal day-to-day  activities and disaster related activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Preparation, revision, and adoption of regulations, directives,  manuals, and other guidance documents related to actions that qualify  for categorical exclusions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Studies that involve no commitment of resources other than  manpower and associated funding;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inspection and monitoring activities, granting of variances,  and actions to enforce Federal, state, or local codes, standards or  regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Training activities and both training and operational exercises  utilizing existing facilities in accordance with established procedures  and land use designations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Procurement of goods and services for support of day-to-day and  emergency operational activities, and the temporary storage of goods  other than hazardous materials, so long as storage occurs on previously  disturbed land or in existing facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The acquisition of properties and the associated demolition/ removal [see paragraph (d)(2)(xii) of this section] or relocation of  structures [see paragraph (d)(2)(xiii) of this section] under any  applicable authority when the acquisition is from a willing seller, the  buyer coordinated acquisition planning with affected authorities, and  the acquired property will be dedicated in perpetuity to uses that are  compatible with open space, recreational, or wetland practices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Acquisition or lease of existing facilities where planned  uses conform to past use or local land use requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Acquisition, installation, or operation of utility and  communication systems that use existing distribution systems or  facilities, or currently used infrastructure rights-of-way;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Routine maintenance, repair, and grounds-keeping activities at  FEMA facilities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Planting of indigenous vegetation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> Demolition of structures and other improvements or disposal of  uncontaminated structures and other improvements to permitted off-site  locations, or both;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiii)</em> Physical relocation of individual structures where FEMA has  no involvement in the relocation site selection or development;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xiv)</em> Granting of community-wide exceptions for floodproofed  residential   basements meeting the requirements of 44 CFR 60.6(c) under the National  Flood Insurance Program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xv)</em> Repair, reconstruction, restoration, elevation, retrofitting,  upgrading to current codes and standards, or replacement of any facility  in a manner that substantially conforms to the preexisting design,  function, and location; [SE, in part]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvi)</em> Improvements to existing facilities and the construction of  small scale hazard mitigation measures in existing developed areas with  substantially completed infrastructure, when the immediate project area  has already been disturbed, and when those actions do not alter basic  functions, do not exceed capacity of other system components, or modify  intended land use; provided the operation of the completed project will  not, of itself, have an adverse effect on the quality of the human  environment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xvii)</em> Actions conducted within enclosed facilities where all  airborne emissions, waterborne effluent, external radiation levels,  outdoor noise, and solid and bulk waste disposal practices comply with  existing Federal, state, and local laws and regulations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xviii)</em> The following planning and administrative activities in  support of emergency and disaster response and recovery:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Activation of the Emergency Support Team and convening of the  Catastrophic Disaster Response Group at FEMA headquarters;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Activation of the Regional Operations Center and deployment of  the Emergency Response Team, in whole or in part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Situation Assessment including ground and aerial reconnaissance;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Information and data gathering and reporting efforts in support  of emergency and disaster response and recovery and hazard mitigation;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xix)</em> The following emergency and disaster response, recovery and  hazard mitigation activities under the Stafford Act:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> General Federal Assistance (Sec. 402); [SE]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Essential Assistance (Sec. 403); [SE]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Debris Removal (Sec. 407) [SE]</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Temporary Housing (Sec. 408), except locating multiple mobile  homes or other readily fabricated dwellings on sites, other than private  residences, not previously used for such purposes;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Unemployment Assistance (Sec. 410);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Individual and Family Grant Programs (Sec. 411), except for  grants that will be used for restoring, repairing or building private  bridges, or purchasing mobile homes or other readily fabricated  dwellings;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Food Coupons and Distribution (Sec. 412);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Food Commodities (Sec. 413);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(I)</em> Legal Services (Sec. 415);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(J)</em> Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training (Sec. 416);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(K)</em> Community Disaster Loans (Sec. 417);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(L)</em> Emergency Communications (Sec. 418);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(M)</em> Emergency Public Transportation (Sec. 419);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(N)</em> Fire Management Assistance Grants; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(O)</em> Federal Emergency Assistance (Sec. 502) [SE].</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Extraordinary circumstances. If extraordinary circumstances  exist within an area affected by an action, such that an action that is  categorically excluded from NEPA compliance may have a significant  adverse environmental impact, an environmental assessment shall be  prepared. Extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant  environmental impact include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Greater scope or size than normally experienced for a particular  category of action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Actions with a high level of public controversy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Potential for degradation, even though slight, of already  existing poor environmental conditions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Employment of unproven technology with potential adverse  effects or actions involving unique or unknown environmental risks;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Presence of endangered or threatened species or their critical  habitat, or archaeological, cultural, historical or other protected  resources;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Presence of hazardous or toxic substances at levels which  exceed Federal, state or local regulations or   standards requiring action or attention;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Actions with the potential to affect special status areas  adversely or other critical resources such as wetlands, coastal zones,  wildlife refuge and wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, sole or  principal drinking water aquifers;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Potential for adverse effects on health or safety; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Potential to violate a Federal, State, local or tribal law or  requirement imposed for the protection of the environment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Potential for significant cumulative impact when the proposed  action is combined with other past, present and reasonably foreseeable  future actions, even though the impacts of the proposed action may not  be significant by themselves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Documentation. The Regional Administrator will prepare and  maintain an administrative record of each proposal that is determined to  be categorically excluded from the preparation of an environmental  impact statement or an environmental assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Revocation. The Regional Administrator shall revoke a  determination of categorical exclusion and shall require a full  environmental review if, subsequent to the granting an exclusion, the  Regional Administrator determines that due to changes in the proposed  action or in light of new findings, the action no longer meets the  requirements for a categorical exclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Changes to the list of exclusion categories. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The FEMA list  of exclusion categories will be continually reviewed and refined as  additional categories are identified and experience is gained in the  categorical exclusion process.
