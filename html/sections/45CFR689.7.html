To avoid influencing reviews, reviewers or panelists will not  be informed of allegations or of ongoing inquiries or investigations.  However, if allegations, inquiries, or investigations have been rumored  or publicized, the responsible Program Director may consult with OIG  and, after further consultation with the Office of General Counsel,  either defer review, inform reviewers to disregard the matter, or inform  reviewers of the status of the matter.</p>
