                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management,  is ``to avoid to the extent possible the long and short-term adverse  impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains  and to avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development  wherever there is a practicable alternative.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, is  ``to avoid to the extent possible the long- and short-term adverse  impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands and  to avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands  wherever there is a practicable alternative.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This part implements the requirements of Executive Order 11988,  Floodplain Management, and Executive Order 11990, Protection of  Wetlands, and employs the principles of the Unified National Program for  Floodplain Management. These regulations apply to all HUD (or  responsible entity) actions that are subject to potential harm by  location in floodplains or wetlands. Covered actions include the  proposed acquisition, construction, demolition, improvement,  disposition, financing, and use of properties located in floodplains or  wetlands for which approval is required either from HUD, under any  applicable HUD program, or from a responsible entity authorized by 24  CFR part 58.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This part does not prohibit approval of such actions (except for  certain actions in Coastal High Hazard Areas), but provides a consistent  means for implementing the Department's interpretation of the Executive  Orders in the project approval decisionmaking processes of HUD and of  responsible entities subject to 24 CFR part 58. The implementation of  Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 under this part shall be conducted by  HUD for Department-administered programs subject to environmental review  under 24 CFR part 50 and by authorized responsible entities that are  responsible for environmental review under 24 CFR part 58.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Nonstructural alternatives to floodplain development and the  destruction of wetlands are both favored and encouraged to reduce the  loss of life and property caused by floods, and to restore the natural  resources and functions of floodplains and wetlands. Nonstructural  alternatives should be discussed in the decisionmaking process where  practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of  1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), proposed HUD financial assistance (including  mortgage insurance) for acquisition or construction purposes in any  ``area having special flood hazards'' (a flood zone designated by the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)) shall not be approved in  communities identified by FEMA as eligible for flood insurance but which  are not participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. This  prohibition only applies to proposed HUD financial assistance in a FEMA- designated area of special flood hazard one year after the community has  been formally notified by FEMA of the designation of the affected area.  This prohibition is not applicable to HUD financial assistance in the  form of formula grants to states, including financial assistance under  the State-administered CDBG Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart I) and the  State-administered Rental Rehabilitation Program (24 CFR 511.51),  Emergency Shelter Grant amounts allocated to States (24 CFR parts 575  and 576), and HOME funds provided to a state under Title II of the  Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12701- 12839).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under section 582 of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of  1994 (42 U.S.C. 5154a), HUD disaster assistance that is made available  in a special flood hazard area may not be used to make a payment  (including any loan assistance payment) to a person for repair,  replacement, or restoration of damage to any personal, residential, or  commercial property if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The person had previously received Federal flood disaster  assistance conditioned on obtaining and maintaining flood insurance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person failed to obtain and maintain the flood insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, no HUD  financial assistance (including mortgage insurance) may be approved  after May 23, 1994 with respect to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any action other than a functionally dependent use or floodplain  function restoration activity, located in a floodway;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any critical action located in a coastal high hazard area; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any noncritical action located in a Coastal High Hazard Area,  unless the action is a functionally dependent use, existing construction  (including improvements), or reconstruction following destruction caused  by a disaster. If the action is not a functionally dependent use, the  action must be designed for location in a Coastal High   Hazard Area. An action will be considered designed for a Coastal High  Hazard Area if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of reconstruction following destruction caused by a  disaster or substantial improvement, the work meets the current  standards for V zones in FEMA regulations (44 CFR 60.3(e)) and, if  applicable, the Minimum Property Standards for such construction in 24  CFR 200.926d(c)(4)(iii); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of existing construction (including any minor  improvements):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The work met FEMA elevation and construction standards for a  coastal high hazard area (or if such a zone or such standards were not  designated, the 100-year floodplain) applicable at the time the original  improvements were constructed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the original improvements were constructed before FEMA  standards for the 100-year floodplain became effective or before FEMA  designated the location of the action as within the 100-year floodplain,  the work would meet at least the earliest FEMA standards for  construction in the 100-year floodplain.
