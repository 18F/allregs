                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of performance measurement is to strengthen the RSVP project and foster continuous improvement. Reporting on performance measures is used by the Corporation as part of assessing the impact of the project on the community and on the accomplishment of the objectives established in the Corporation's Strategic Plan. In addition, as part of the competitive process, performance measures are used to assess how an applicant for a grant approaches the design of volunteer activities and the measurement of their impact on community needs.</p>
