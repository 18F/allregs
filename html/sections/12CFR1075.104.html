Victims' compensable harm for  purposes of this part is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a final order in a Bureau enforcement action ordered redress  for a class of victims, the compensable harm of each victim in the class  is equal to that victim's share of the total redress ordered, including  any amounts that are suspended or waived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a final order in a Bureau enforcement action does not order  redress for a class of victims, those victims' compensable harm is as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Bureau sought redress for a class of victims but a court  or administrative tribunal denied that request for redress in the final  order, the victims in that class have no compensable harm.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if  the final order in the Bureau enforcement action specifies the amount of  the victims' harm, including by prescribing a formula for calculating  that harm, each victim's compensable harm is equal to that victim's  share of the amount specified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if  the final order in the Bureau enforcement action does not specify the  amount of the victims' harm, each victim's compensable harm is equal to  the victim's out-of-pocket losses that resulted from the violation or  violations for which a civil penalty was imposed, except to the extent  such losses are impracticable to determine.</p>
