                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If any party files exceptions to the administrative law judge's  decision, the Board, with the assistance of the staff counsel to each  Board Member who function in much the same manner as law clerks do for  judges, reviews the entire record, including the administrative law  judge's decision and recommendations, the exceptions thereto, the  complete transcript of evidence, and the exhibits, briefs, and  arguments. The Board does not consult with members of the administrative  law judge's staff of the division of judges or with any agent of the  General Counsel in its deliberations. It then issues its decision and  order in which it may adopt, modify, or reject the findings and  recommendations of the administrative law judge. The decision and order  contains detailed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and basic  reasons for decision on all material issues raised, and an order either  dismissing the complaint in whole or in part or requiring the respondent  to cease and desist from its unlawful practices and to take appropriate  affirmative action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If no exceptions are filed, the administrative law judge's  decision and recommended order automatically become the decision and  order of the Board pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act. All objections  and exceptions, whether or not previously made during or after the  hearing, are deemed waived for all purposes.</p>
