                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this section: (1) Act means the  Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Immigration Reform  and Control Act of 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Service means the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Resided continuously means that the alien shall be regarded as  having resided continuously in the United States if, at the time of  filing of the application for temporary resident status:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No single absence from the United States has exceeded 45 days,  and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded 180 days between July  21, 1984, through the date the application for temporary resident status  is filed, unless the alien can establish that due to emergent reasons,  his or her return to the United States could not be accomplished within  the time period allowed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The alien was maintaining residence in the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The alien's departure from the United States was not based on  an order of deportation.  An alien who has been absent from the United States in accordance with  the Service's advance parole procedures shall not be considered as  having interrupted his or her continuous residence as required at the  time of filing an application. An alien who, after appearing for a  scheduled interview to obtain an immigrant visa at a Consulate or  Embassy in Canada or Mexico but who subsequently is not issued an  immigrant visa and who is paroled back into the United States pursuant  to the stateside criteria program, shall be considered as having resided  continuously.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Continous residence means that the alien shall be regarded as  having resided continously in the United States if, at the time of  applying for adjustment from temporary residence to permanent resident  status: No single absence from the United States has exceeded 30 days,  and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded 90 days between the  date on which lawful temporary resident status was granted and the date  permanent resident status was applied for, unless the alien can  establish that due to emergent reasons or extenuating circumstances  beyond his or her control, the return to the United States could not be  accomplished within the time period(s) allowed. A single absence from  the United States of more than 30 days, and aggregate absences of more  than 90 days during the period for which continuous residence is  required for adjustment to permanent resident status, shall break the  continuity of such residence unless the temporary   resident can establish to the satisfaction of the district director that  he or she did not, in fact, abandon his or her residence in the United  States during such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> To make a determination means obtaining and reviewing all  information required to adjudicate an application for the benefit sought  and making a decision thereon. If fraud, willful misrepresentation or  concealment of a material fact, knowingly providing a false writing or  document, knowingly making a false statement or representation, or any  other activity prohibited by the Act is established during the process  of making the determination on the application, the Service shall refer  the matter to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the alien or  of any person who created or supplied a false writing or document for  use in an application for adjustment of status under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Continuous physical presence means actual continuous presence in  the United States since December 22, 1987, until filing of any  application for adjustment of status. Aliens who were outside of the  United States after enactment may apply for temporary residence if they  reentered prior to March 21, 1988, provided they meet the continuous  residence requirements, and are otherwise eligible for legalization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Brief, casual, and innocent means a departure authorized by the  Service (advance parole) subsequent to March 21, 1988, for not more than  30 days for legitimate emergency or humanitarian purposes unless a  further period of authorized departure has been granted in the  discretion of the district director or a departure was beyond the  alien's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Brief and casual means temporary trips abroad as long as the  alien establishes a continuing intention to adjust to lawful permanent  resident status. However, such absences must not exceed the specific  periods of time required in order to maintain continuous residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Certain nationals of countries for which extended voluntary  departure has been made available on the basis of a nationality group  determination at any time during the 5-year period ending on November 1,  1987 is limited to nationals of Poland, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and  Uganda.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Public cash assistance means income or need-based monetary  assistance to include, but not limited to, supplemental security income  received by the alien through federal, state, or local programs designed  to meet subsistence levels. It does not include assistance in kind, such  as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits, nor does it  include work related compensation or certain types of medical assistance  (Medicare, Medicaid, emergency treatment, services to pregnant women or  children under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of public  health).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Designated entity means any state, local, church, community,  farm labor organization, voluntary organization, association of  agricultural employers or individual determined by the Service to be  qualified to assist aliens in the preparation of applications for  legalization status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Through the passage of time means through the expiration date  of the nonimmigrant permission to remain in the United States, including  any extensions and/or change of status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Prima facie eligibility means eligibility is established if the  applicant presents a completed I-687 and specific factual information  which in the absence of rebuttal will establish a claim of eligibility  under this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application for temporary residence--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application for  temporary residence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda,  Ethiopia, or Afghanistan who has resided continuously in the United  States since prior to July 2l, 1984, and who believes that he or she  meets the eligibility requirements of section 245A of the Act must make  application within the 21-month period beginning on March 21, 1988, and  ending on December 22, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien who fails to file an application for adjustment of  status to that of a temporary resident under Sec. 245A.4 of this part  during the time period, will be statutorily ineligible for such  adjustment of status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility (i) The following categories of aliens who are not  otherwise excludable under section 212(a) of the Act are eligible to  apply for status to   that of a person admitted for temporary residence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or  Afghanistan, (other than an alien who entered as a nonimmigrant) who  establishes that he or she entered the United States prior to July 21,  1984, and who has thereafter resided continuously in the United States,  and who has been physically present in the United States from December  22, 1987, until the date of filing the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or  Afghanistan, and establishes that he or she entered the United States as  a nonimmigrant prior to July 21, 1984, and whose period of authorized  admission expired through the passage of time prior to January 21, 1985,  and who has thereafter resided continuously in the United States, and  who has been physically present in the United States from December 22,  1987, until the date of filing the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or  Afghanistan, and establishes that he or she entered the United States as  a nonimmigrant prior to July 21, 1984, and who applied for asylum prior  to July 21, 1984, and who has thereafter resided continuously in the  United States, and who has been physically present in the United States  from December 22, 1987, until the date of filing the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or  Afghanistan, who would otherwise be eligible for temporary resident  status and who establishes that he or she resided continuously in the  United States prior to July 21, 1984, and who subsequently reentered the  United States as a nonimmigrant in order to return to an unrelinquished  residence. An alien described in this paragraph must have received a  waiver of 212(a)(19) as an alien who entered the United States by fraud.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or  Afghanistan, and was a nonimmigrant who entered the United States in the  classification A, A-1, A-2, G, G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4, for Duration of  Status (D/S), and whose qualifying employment terminated or who ceased  to be recognized by the Department of State as being entitled to such  classification prior to January 21, 1985, and who thereafter continued  to reside in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or  Afghanistan, and who was a nonimmigrant who entered the United States as  an F, F-1, or F-2 for Duration of Status (D/S), and who completed a full  course of studies, including practical training (if any), and whose time  period to depart the United States after completion of studies expired  prior to January 21, 1985, and who has thereafter continued to reside in  the United States. Those students placed in a nunc pro tunc retroactive  student status which would otherwise preclude their eligibility for  legalization under this section, must present evidence that they had  otherwise terminated their status during the requisite time period. A  dependent F-2 alien otherwise eligible who was admitted into the United  States with a specific time period, as opposed to duration of status,  documented on Service Form I-94 (see Sec. 1.4), Arrival-Departure  Record that extended beyond July 21, 1984 is considered eligible if the  principal F-1 alien is found eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ineligible aliens. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An alien who has been convicted of a  felony, or three or more misdemeanors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien who has assisted in the persecution of any person or  persons on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a  particular social group, or political opinion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An alien excludable under the provisions of section 212(a) of  the Act whose grounds of excludability may not be waived.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Documentation. Evidence to support an alien's eligibility for  temporary residence status shall include documents establishing proof of  identity, proof of nationality, proof of residence, and proof of  financial responsibility, as well as photographs, a completed  fingerprint card (Form FD-258), and a completed medical report of  examination (Form I-693). All documentation submitted will be subject to  Service verification. Applications submitted with unverifiable  documentation may be denied. Failure by an applicant to authorize  release to INS of   information protected by the Privacy Act and/or related laws in order  for INS to adjudicate a claim may result in denial of the benefit  sought. Acceptable supporting documents for the four categories of  documentation are discussed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Proof of identity. Evidence to establish identity is listed  below in descending order of preference:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Passport;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Birth certificate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any national identity document from the alien's country of  origin bearing photo and fingerprint;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Driver's license or similar document issued by a state if it  contains a photo;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Baptismal Record/Marriage Certificate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Affidavits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proof of nationality. Evidence to establish nationality is  listed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Passport;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Birth certificate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any national identity document from the alien's country of  origin bearing photo and fingerprint;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other credible documents, including those created by, or in the  possession of the INS, or any other documents (excluding affidavits)  that, when taken singly, or together as a whole, establish the alien's  nationality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assumed names--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> General. In cases where an applicant claims  to have met any of the eligibility criteria under an assumed name, the  applicant has the burden of proving that the applicant was in fact the  person who used that name. The applicant's true identity is established  pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this  section. The assumed name must appear in the documentation provided by  the applicant to establish eligibility. To meet the requirement of this  paragraph, documentation must be submitted to prove the common identity,  i.e., that the assumed name was in fact used by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Proof of common identity. The most persuasive evidence is a  document issued in the assumed name which identifies the applicant by  photograph, fingerprint, or detailed physical description. Other  evidence which will be considered are affidavit(s) by a person or  persons other than the applicant, made under oath, which identify the  affiant by name and address, state the affiant's relationship to the  applicant and the basis of the affiant's knowledge of the applicant's  use of the assumed name. Affidavits accompanied by a photograph which  has been identified by the affiant as the individual known to the  affiant under the assumed name in question will carry greater weight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Proof of residence. Evidence to establish proof of continuous  residence in the United States during the requisite period of time may  consist of any combination of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Past employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2  Forms, certification of the filing of Federal income tax returns on IRS  Form 6166, a state verification of the filing of state income tax  returns, letters from employer(s) or, if the applicant has been in  business for himself or herself, letters from banks and other firms with  whom he or she has done business. In all of the above, the name of the  alien and the name of the employer or other interested organizations  must appear on the form or letter, as well as relevant dates. Letters  from employers should be on employer letterhead stationery, if the  employer has such stationery, and must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alien's address at the time of employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exact period of employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Periods of layoff;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Duties with the company;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Whether or not the information was taken from official company  records; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> of this section. This affidavit form letter shall be signed,  attested to by the employer under penalty of perjury, and shall state  the employer's willingness to come forward and give testimony if  requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Utility bills (gas, electric, phone, etc.) receipts, or letters  from companies showing the dates during which the applicant received  service are acceptable documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> School records (letters, report cards, etc.) from the schools  that the applicant or his or her children have attended in the United  States must show the name of school and periods of school attendance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hospital or medical records showing treatment or hospitalization  of the applicant or his or her children must show the name of the  medical facility or physician and the date(s) of the treatment or  hospitalization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Attestations by churches, unions, or other organizations as to  the applicant's residence by letter which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify applicant by name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Are signed by an official (whose title is shown);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Show inclusive dates of membership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> State the address where applicant resided during membership  period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Include the seal of the organization impressed on the letter or  the letterhead of the organization, if the organization has letterhead  stationery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Establish how the author knows the applicant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Establish the origin of the information being attested to.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Additional documents to support the applicant's claim may  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Money order receipts for money sent into or out of the country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Passport entries;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Birth certificates of children born in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bank books with dated transactions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Letters or correspondence between applicant and other person or  organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Social Security card;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Selective Service card;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Automobile license receipts, title, vehicle registration, etc.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Deeds, mortgages, contracts to which applicant has been a party;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Tax receipts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Insurance policies, receipts, or letters; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Any other relevant document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Proof of financial responsibility. An applicant for adjustment  of status under this part is subject to the provisions of section  212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to  become public charges. Generally, the evidence of employment submitted  under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section will serve to demonstrate  the alien's financial responsibility during the documented period(s) of  employment. If the alien's period(s) of residence in the United States  include significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe  that the alien may have received public assistance while employed, the  alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not received  public cash assistance. An applicant for residence who is determined  likely to become a public charge and is unable to overcome this  determination after application of the Special Rule under paragraph  (b)(11)(iv)(C) of this section will be denied adjustment. The burden of  proof to demonstrate the inapplicability of this provision of law lies  with the applicant who may provide:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Evidence of a history of employment (i.e., employment letter, W- 2 forms, income tax returns, etc.);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Evidence that he/she is self-supporting (i.e., bank statements,  stocks, other assets, etc.); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Form I-134. Affidavit of Support, completed by a spouse on  behalf of the applicant and/or children of the applicant or a parent in  behalf of children which guarantees complete or partial financial  support. Acceptance of the Affidavit of Support shall be extended to  other family members in unusual family circumstances.  Generally, the evidence of employment submitted under paragraph  (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section will serve to demonstrate the alien's  financial responsibility during the documented period(s) of employment.  If the alien's period(s) of residence in the United States include  significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe that the  alien may have received public assistance while employed, the alien may  be required to provide proof that he or she has not received public cash  assistance. An applicant for residence who is likely to become a public  charge will be denied adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Burden of proof. An alien applying for adjustment of status  under this part has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the  evidence that he or she has resided in the United States for the  requisite periods, is admissible to the United States under the  provisions of section 245A of the Act, and is otherwise eligible for  adjustment of status under this section. The inference to be drawn from  the documentation provided shall depend on the extent of the  documentation, its credibility and amenability to verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Evidence. The sufficiency of all evidence produced by the  applicant will be judged according to its probative value and  credibility. To meet his or her burden of proof, an applicant must  provide evidence of eligibility apart from his or her own testimony. In  judging the probative value and credibility of the evidence submitted,  greater weight will be given to the submission of original  documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Filing of application. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The application must be filed on Form  I-687 at an office of a designated entity or at a Service office within  the jurisdiction of the district where the applicant resides. If the  application is filed with a designated entity, the alien must have  consented to having the designated entity forward the application to the  Service office. In the case of applications filed at a Service office,  the district director may, at his or her discretion:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Require the applicant to file the application in person; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Require the applicant to file the application by mail; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Permit the filing of applications whether by mail or in person.  The applicant must appear for a personal interview at the Service office  as scheduled. If the applicant is 14 years of age or older, the  application must be accompanied by a completed Form FD-258 (Applicant  Card).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the time of the interview, whenever possible, original  documents must be submitted except the following: Official government  records; employment or employment-related records maintained by  employers, union, or collective bargaining organizations; medical  records; school records maintained by a school or school board; or other  records maintained by a party other than the applicant. Copies of  records maintained by parties other than the applicant which are  submitted in evidence must be certified as true and correct by such  parties and must bear their seal or signature or the signature and title  of persons authorized to act in their behalf. If at the time of the  interview the return of the original document is desired by the  applicant, the document must be accompanied by notarized copies or  copies certified true and correct by a qualified designated entity or by  the alien's representative in the format prescribed in Sec. 204.2(j)(1)  or (2) of this chapter. At the discretion of the district director,  original documents, even if accompanied by certified copies, may be  temporarily retained for forensic examination by the Document Analysis  Unit at the Regional Processing Facility having jurisdiction over the  Service office to which the documents were submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A separate application (I-687) must be filed by each eligible  applicant. All fees required by Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter must  be submitted in the exact amount in the form of a money order, cashier's  check, or certified bank check, made payable to the Immigration and  Naturalization Service. No personal checks or currency will be accepted.  Fees will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Filing date of application. The date the alien submits a  completed application to a Service office or designated entity shall be  considered the filing date of the application, provided that in the case  of an application filed at a designated entity the alien has consented  to having the designated entity forward the application to the Service  office having jurisdiction over the location of the alien's residence.  Designated entities are required to forward completed applications to  the appropriate Service office within 60 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Selective Service registration. At the time of filing an  application under this section, male applicants over the age of 17 and  under the age of 26, are required to be registered under the Military  Selective Service Act. An applicant shall present evidence that he has   previously registered under that Act in the form of a letter of  acknowledgement from the Selective Service System, or such alien shall  present a completed and signed Form SSS-1 at the time of filing Form I- 687 with the Immigration and Naturalization Service or a designated  entity. Form SSS-1 will be forwarded to the Selective Service System by  the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Continuous residence. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of this Act, an  applicant for temporary residence status shall be regarded as having  resided continuously in the United States if, at the time of filing of  the application:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No single absence from the United States has exceeded 45 days,  and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded 180 days between July  2l, 1984, through the date the application for temporary resident status  is filed, unless the alien can establish that due to emergent reasons,  his or her return to the United States could not be accomplished within  the time period allowed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The alien was maintaining a residence in the United States; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The alien's departure from the United States was not based on an  order of deportation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien who has been absent from the United States in  accordance with the Service's advance parole procedures shall not be  considered as having interrupted his or her continuous residence as  required at the time of filing an application under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Medical examination. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An applicant under this part shall be  required to submit to an examination by a designated civil surgeon at no  expense to the government. The designated civil surgeon shall report on  the findings of the mental and physical condition of the applicant and  the determination of the alien's immunization status on Form I-693,  ``Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status, (Pub. L.  99-603)''. Results of the medical examination must be presented to the  Service at the time of interview and shall be incorporated into the  record. Any applicant certified under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) or  (5) of section 212(a) of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical  Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in section 234 of  the Act and part 235 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All applicants who file for temporary resident status are  required to include the results of a serological test for the HIV virus  on the I-693. All HIV-positive applicants shall be advised that a waiver  is available and shall be provided with the opportunity to apply for a  waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Interview. Each applicant, regardless of age, must appear at  the appropriate Service office and must be fingerprinted for the purpose  of issuance of an employment authorization document and Form I-688. Each  applicant shall be interviewed by an immigration officer, except that  the interview may be waived for a child under 14 years of age, or when  it is impractical because of the health or advanced age of the  applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Applicability of exclusion grounds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Grounds of exclusion  not to be applied. Paragraphs (14), (workers entering without labor  certification); (20), (immigrants not in possession of a valid entry  document); (21), (visas issued without compliance with section 203);  (25), (illiterates); and (32) (graduates of non-accredited medical  schools) of section 212(a) of the Act shall not apply to applicants for  temporary resident status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Waiver of grounds of exclusion. Except as provided in paragraph  (b)(11)(iii) of this section, the Attorney General may waive any other  provision of section 212(a) of the Act only in the case of individual  aliens for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when the  granting of such a waiver is in the public interest. If an alien is  excludable on grounds which may be waived as set forth in this  paragraph, he or she shall be advised of the procedures for applying for  a waiver of grounds of excludability on Form I-690. When an application  for waiver of grounds of excludability is filed jointly with an  application for temporary residence under this section, it shall be  accepted for processing at the Service office. If an application for  waiver of grounds of excludability is submitted after the alien's  preliminary interview at the Service office, it shall be forwarded to  the appropriate Regional Processing Facility. All applications   for waivers of grounds of excludability must be accompanied by the  correct fee in the exact amount. All fees for applications filed in the  United States must be in the form of a money order, cashier's check, or  bank check. No personal checks or currency will be accepted. Fees will  not be waived or refunded under any circumstances. An application for  waiver of grounds of excludability under this part shall be approved or  denied by the director of the Regional Processing Facility in whose  jurisdiction the alien's application for adjustment of status was filed  except that in cases involving clear statutory ineligibility or fraud,  such application may be denied by the district director in whose  jurisdiction the application is filed, and in cases returned to a  Service office for re-interview, such application may be approved at the  discretion of the district director. The applicant shall be notified of  the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason therefore.  Appeal from an adverse decision under this part may be taken by the  applicant on Form I-694 within 30 days after the service of the notice  only to the Service's Administrative Appeals Unit pursuant to the  provisions of section 103.3(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Grounds of exclusion that may not be waived. Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Act, the following provisions of section  212(a) may not be waived by the Attorney General under paragraph  (b)(11)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Paragraphs (9) and (10) (criminals);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Paragraph (23) (narcotics) except for a single offense of simple  possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Paragraphs (27) (prejudicial to the public interest), (28)  (communist), and (29) (subversive);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Paragraph (33) (participated in Nazi persecution).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Determination of Likely to become a public charge and the  special rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prior to use of the special rule for determination of  public charge, an alien must first be determined to be excludable under  section 212(a)(15) of the Act. If the applicant is determined to be  likely to become a public charge, he or she may still be admissible  under the terms of the Special Rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In determining whether an alien is likely to become a public  charge, financial responsibility of the alien is to be established by  examining the totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of his  or her application for legalization. The existence or absence of a  particular factor should never be the sole criterion for determining if  an alien is likely to become a public charge. The determination of  financial responsibility should be a prospective evaluation based on the  alien's age, health, income and vocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An alien who has a consistent employment history which shows the  ability to support himself or herself even though his or her income may  be below the poverty level may be admissible under this section. The  alien's employment history need not be continuous in that it is  uninterrupted. It should be continuous in the sense that the alien shall  be regularly attached to the workforce, has an income over a substantial  period of the applicable time, and has demonstrated the capacity to  exist on his or her income without recourse to public cash assistance.  The Special Rule is prospective in that the Service shall determine,  based on the alien's history, whether he or she is likely to become a  public charge. Past acceptance of public cash assistance within a  history of consistent employment will enter into this decision. The  weight given in considering applicability of the public charge  provisions will depend on many factors, but the length of time an  applicant has received public cash assistance will constitute a  significant factor. It is not necessary to file a waiver in order to  apply the Special Rule for Determination of Public Charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Public assistance and criminal history verification.  Declarations by an applicant that he or she has not been the recipient  of public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are  subject to a verification of facts by the Service. The applicant must  agree to fully cooperate in the verification process. Failure to assist  the Service in verifying information necessary for the adjudication of  the application may result in a denial of the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Continuous physical presence since December 22, 1987. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An  alien applying   for adjustment to temporary resident status must establish that he or  she has been continuously physically present in the United States since  December 22, 1987. Aliens who were outside of the United States on the  date of enactment or departed the United States after enactment may  apply for legalization if they reentered prior to March 21, 1988, and  meet the continuous residence requirements and are otherwise eligible  for legalization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A brief, casual and innocent absence means a departure  authorized by the Service (advance parole) subsequent to March 21, 1988,  of not more than thirty (30) days for legitimate emergency or  humanitarian purposes unless a further period of authorized departure  has been granted in the discretion of the district director or a  departure was beyond the alien's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Departure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the time period from the date that an  alien's application establishing prima facie eligibility for temporary  resident status is reviewed at a Service office and the date status as a  temporary resident is granted, the alien applicant can be readmitted to  the United States provided his or her departure was authorized under the  Service's advance parole provisions contained in Sec. 212.5(f) of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An alien whose application for temporary resident status has  been approved may be admitted to the United States upon return as a  returning temporary resident provided he or she:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Is not under deportation proceedings, such proceedings having  been instituted subsequent to the approval of temporary resident status.  A temporary resident alien will not be considered deported if that alien  departs the United States while under an outstanding order of  deportation issued prior to the approval of temporary resident status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Has not been absent from the United States for more than 30 days  on the date application for admission is made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has not been absent from the United States for an aggregate  period of more than 90 days since the date the alien was granted lawful  temporary resident status;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Presents Form I-688;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Presents himself or herself for inspection; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Is otherwise admissible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The periods of time in paragraphs (b)(13)(ii)(B) and (C) of  this section may be waived at the discretion of the Attorney General in  cases where the absence from the United States was due merely to a brief  and casual trip abroad due to emergent or extenuating circumstances  beyond the alien's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Employment and travel authorization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Authorization  for employment and travel abroad for temporary resident status  applicants under this section may be granted only by a Service office.  INS district directors will determine the Service location for the  completion of processing travel documentation. In the case of an  application which has been filed with a designated entity, employment  authorization may be granted by the Service only after the application  has been properly received at the Service office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employment and travel authorization prior to the granting of  temporary resident status. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Permission to travel abroad and accept  employment may be granted to the applicant after an interview has been  conducted in connection with an application establishing prima facie  eligibility for temporary resident status. Permission to travel abroad  may be granted in emergent circumstances in accordance with the  Service's advance parole provisions contained in Sec. 212.5(f) of this  chapter after an interview has been conducted in connection with an  application establishing prima facie eligibility for temporary resident  status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If an appointment cannot be scheduled within 30 days,  authorization to accept employment will be granted, valid until the  scheduled appointment date. The appointment letter will be endorsed with  the temporary employment authorization. An employment authorization  document will be given to the applicant after an interview has been  completed by an immigration officer unless a formal denial is issued by  a Service office. This temporary employment authorization will be  restricted to six-months duration, pending final determination on the  application for temporary resident status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employment and travel authorization upon grant of temporary  resident status. Upon grant of an application for adjustment to  temporary resident status by a Regional Processing Facility, the  processing facility will forward a notice of approval to the alien at  his or her last known address, or to his or her legal representative.  The alien will be required to return to the appropriate INS office,  surrender the I-688A or employment authorization document previously  issued, and obtain Form I-688, Temporary Resident Card, authorizing  employment and travel abroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Revocation of employment authorization upon denial of temporary  resident status. Upon denial of an application for adjustment to  temporary resident status, the alien will be notified that if a timely  appeal is not submitted, employment authorization shall be automatically  revoked on the final day of the appeal period. An applicant whose appeal  period has ended is no longer considered to be an Eligible Legalized  Alien for the purposes of the administration of State Legalization  Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAG) funding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Decision. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the  decision. If the application is denied, the reason(s) for the decision  shall be provided to the applicant. An appeal from an adverse decision  under this part may be taken by the applicant on Form I-694.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Appeal process. An adverse decision under this part may be  appealed to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative  Appeals Unit), the appellate authority designated in Sec. 103.1(f)(2).  Any appeal shall be submitted to the Regional Processing Facility (RPF)  with the required fee within 30 days after service of the Notice of  Denial in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 103.3(a) of this  chapter. An appeal received after the 30-day period will not be  accepted. The 30-day period for submission of an appeal begins three  days after the Notice of Denial is mailed as provided in 8 CFR 103.8(b).  If a review of the Record of Proceeding (ROP) is requested by the alien  or his or her legal representative and an appeal has been properly  filed, an additional 30 days will be allowed for this review beginning  at the time the ROP is mailed. A brief may be submitted with the appeal  form or submitted up to 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the  appeal form at the RPF. Briefs filed after submission of the appeal  should be mailed directly to the RPF. For good cause shown, the time  within which a brief supporting an appeal may be submitted may be  extended by the Director of the Regional Processing Facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Motions. The Regional Processing Facility director may sua  sponte reopen and reconsider any adverse decision. When an appeal to the  Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) has  been filed, the INS director of the Regional Processing Facility may  issue a new decision granting the benefit which has been requested. The  director's new decision must be served on the appealing party within 45  days of receipt of any briefs and/or new evidence, or upon expiration of  the time allowed for the submission of any briefs. Motions to reopen a  proceeding or reconsider a decision shall not be considered under this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Certifications. The Regional Processing Facility director may,  in accordance with Sec. 103.4 of this chapter, certify a decision to  the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit)  when the case involves an unusually complex or novel question of law or  fact. The decision on an appealed case subsequently remanded to the  Regional Processing Facility director will be certified to the  Administrative Appeals Unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Date of adjustment to temporary residence. The status of an  alien whose application for temporary resident status is approved shall  be adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident as of the date  indicated on the application fee receipt issued at the Service office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Termination of temporary resident status--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Termination of  temporary resident status (General). The status of an alien lawfully  admitted for temporary residence under Sec. 245a.4 of this part may be  terminated at any time. It is not necessary that a final order of  deportation be entered in order to terminate temporary resident status.  The temporary resident status may be terminated upon the occurrence of  any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> It is determined that the alien was ineligible for temporary  residence under Sec. 245a.4 of this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The alien commits an act which renders him or her inadmissible  as an immigrant unless a waiver is obtained, as provided in this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The alien is convicted of any felony, or three or more  misdemeanors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The alien fails to file for adjustment of status from temporary  resident to permanent resident within 31 months of the date he or she  was granted status as a temporary resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedure. Termination of an alien's status will be made only  on notice to the alien sent by certified mail directed to his or her  last known address, and, if applicable, to his or her representative.  The alien must be given an opportunity to offer evidence in opposition  to the grounds alleged for termination of his or her status. Evidence in  opposition must be submitted within 30 days after the service of the  Notice of Intent to Terminate. If the alien's status is terminated, the  director of the Regional Processing Facility shall notify the alien of  the decision and the reason for the termination, and further notify the  alien that any Service Form issued to the alien authorizing employment  and/or travel abroad, or any Form I-688, Temporary Resident Card  previously issued to the alien will be declared void by the director of  the Regional Processing Facility within 30 days if no appeal of the  termination decision is filed within that period. The alien may appeal  the decision to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative  Appeals Unit). Any appeal along with the required fee, shall be filed  with the Regional Processing Facility within 30 days after the service  of the notice of termination. If no appeal is filed within that period,  the official Service document shall be deemed void, and must be  surrendered without delay to an immigration officer or to the issuing  office of the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Termination not construed as rescission under section 246. For  the purposes of this part the phrase termination of status of an alien  granted lawful temporary residence under this section shall not be  construed to necessitate a rescission of status as described in section  246 of the Act, and the proceedings required by the regulations issued  thereunder shall not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Return to unlawful status after termination. Termination of the  status of any alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary residence  shall act to return such alien to the status held prior to the  adjustment, and render him or her amenable to exclusion or deportation  proceedings under sections 236 or 242 of the Act, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Ineligibility for immigration benefits. An alien whose status  is adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident under Sec. 245a.4 of  this part is not entitled to submit a petition pursuant to section  203(a)(2), nor is such alien entitled to any other benefit or  consideration accorded under the Act to aliens lawfully admitted for  permanent residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> Declaration of intending citizen. An alien who has been granted  the status of temporary resident under Sec. 245a.4 of this part may  assert a claim of discrimination on the basis of citizenship status  under section 274B of the Act only if he or she has previously filed  Form I-772 (Declaration of Intending Citizen) after being granted such  status. The Declaration of Intending Citizen is not required as a basis  for filing a petition for naturalization; nor shall it be regarded as a  right to United States citizenship; nor shall it be regarded as evidence  of a person's status as a resident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> Limitation on access to information and confidentiality. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No  person other than a sworn officer or employee of the Department of  Justice or bureau or agency thereof, will be permitted to examine  individual applications. For purposes of this part, any individual  employed under contract by the Service to work in connection with the  Legalization Program shall be considered an employee of the Department  of Justice or bureau or agency thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No information furnished pursuant to an application for  temporary or permanent resident status under this section shall be used  for any purpose except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To make a determination on the application; or,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> for the enforcement of the provisions encompassed in section  245A(c)(6)   of the Act, except as provided in paragraph (b)(23)(iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a determination is made by the Service that the alien has,  in connection with his or her application, engaged in fraud or willful  misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, knowingly provided  a false writing or document in making his or her application, knowingly  made a false statement or representation, or engaged in any other  activity prohibited by section 245A(c)(6) of the Act, the Service shall  refer the matter to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the  alien or of any person who created or supplied a false writing or  document for use in an application for adjustment of status under this  part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Information contained in granted legalization files may be used  by the Service at a later date to make a decision on an immigrant visa  petition (or other status petition) filed by the applicant under section  204(a), or for naturalization applications submitted by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment from temporary to permanent resident status. The  provisions of Sec. 245a.3 of this part shall be applied to aliens  adjusting to permanent residence under this part.
