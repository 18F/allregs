(1) A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is 18 years of age or older.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is 18 years of age or older.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service must be made by hand delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person named therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The person serving the subpoena must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prepare a certificate of service setting forth the date, time, and manner of service or the reason for any failure of service; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Swear to or affirm the certificate, attach it to a copy of the subpoena, and return it to the party on whose behalf the subpoena was served.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Witness fees.
