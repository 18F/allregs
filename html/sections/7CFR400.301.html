These regulations are  applicable to all policies of insurance insured or reinsured by the  Corporation under the Act and on those policies where the insurance  coverage or indemnities are based on determinations applicable to the  individual insured. These regulations will not be applicable to any  policy where the amount of coverage or indemnities are based on the  experience of the area.  [62 FR 22876, Apr. 28, 1997]</p>
