                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formula. Funds appropriated for or reallocated in any fiscal  year (in this section referred to jointly as ``funds'') are to be  distributed to each State as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Two-thirds of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a  State's rail mileage that, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10904(d), is  either potentially subject to abandonment or is to become the subject of  an application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance which  a carrier plans to submit, but has not yet submitted, bears to the total  such rail mileage in all the States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One-third of the funds will be allocated in the ratio which a  State's rail mileage for which the Commission has found within three  years prior to the   first day of the fiscal year for which the funds are being allocated  that the public convenience and necessity permits the abandonment, or  the discontinuance, of rail service on such rail mileage, bears to the  total such rail mileage in all the States. Until September 30, 1981,  such rail mileage includes the rail mileage which was eligible under the  Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to section 402 of the Rail Act,  and all rail mileage which, prior to October 1, 1978, had been included  for formula allocation purposes. The Administrator will calculate rail  mileage under this paragraph as of October 1 of each year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The above calculations will be adjusted if necessary so that no  State receives less than 1 percent of the funds appropriated for a  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reallocation. The Administrator will reallocate among the States  funds which have not been granted under an executed grant agreement by  the end of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated and  funds determined by a Federal audit to be in excess of allowable costs  when they have not been granted under an executed grant agreement by the  end of the fiscal year in which the Federal audit is made. Reallocated  funds are distributed in accordance with the allocation formula  described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interstate sharing of allocated funds. Where not in violation of  State law, two or more States, which are eligible to receive assistance  under the Rail Service Assistance Program pursuant to Sec. 266.5 of this  part may combine any portion of their entitlements for purposes of  conducting any eligible project of mutual benefit provided that they  enter into an agreement for this purpose.</p>
