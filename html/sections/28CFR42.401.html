                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this subpart is to insure that federal agencies which  extend financial assistance properly enforce   title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and similar provisions in  federal grant statutes. Enforcement of the latter statutes is covered by  this subpart to the extent that they relate to prohibiting  discrimination on the ground of race, color or national origin in  programs receiving federal financial assistance of the type subject to  title VI. Responsibility for enforcing title VI rests with the federal  agencies which extend financial assistance. In accord with the authority  granted the Attorney General under Executive Order 12250, this subpart  shall govern the respective obligations of federal agencies regarding  enforcement of title VI. This subpart is to be used in conjunction with  the 1965 Attorney General Guidelines for Enforcement of title VI, 28 CFR  50.3.  [Order No. 670-76, 41 FR 52669, Dec. 1, 1976, as amended by Order No.  960-81, 46 FR 52357, Oct. 27, 1981]</p>
