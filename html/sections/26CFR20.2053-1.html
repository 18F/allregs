                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b) amounts falling  within the following two categories (subject to the limitations  contained in this section and in Sec. Sec. 20.2053-2 through 20.2053- 10)--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First category. Amounts which are payable out of property  subject to claims and which are allowable by the law of the  jurisdiction, whether within or without the United States, under which  the estate is being administered for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Funeral expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Administration expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Claims against the estate (including taxes to the extent set  forth in Sec. 20.2053-6 and charitable pledges to the extent set forth  in Sec. 20.2053-5); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Unpaid mortgages on, or any indebtedness in respect of,  property, the value of the decedent's interest in which is included in  the value of the gross estate undiminished by the mortgage or  indebtedness.  As used in this subparagraph, the phrase ``allowable by the law of the  jurisdiction'' means allowable by the law governing the administration  of decedents' estates. The phrase has no reference to amounts allowable  as deductions under a law which imposes a State death tax. See further  Sec. Sec. 20.2053-2 through 20.2053-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second category. Amounts representing expenses incurred in  administering property which is included in the gross estate but which  is not subject to claims and which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would be allowed as deductions in the first category if the  property being administered were subject to claims; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Were paid before the expiration of the period of limitation for  assessment provided in section 6501.  See further Sec. 20.2053-8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Provisions applicable to both categories--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. If the  item is not one of those described in paragraph (a) of this section, it  is not deductible merely because payment is allowed by the local law. If  the amount which may be expended for the particular purpose is limited  by the local law no deduction in excess of that limitation is  permissible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bona fide requirement--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Amounts allowed as  deductions under section 2053(a) and (b) must be expenses and claims  that are bona fide in nature. No deduction is permissible to the extent  it is founded on a transfer that is essentially donative in character (a  mere cloak for a gift or bequest) except to the extent the deduction is  for a claim that would be allowable as a deduction under section 2055 as  a charitable bequest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Claims and expenses involving family members. Factors  indicative (but not necessarily determinative) of the bona fide nature  of a claim or expense involving a family member of a decedent, a related  entity, or a beneficiary of a decedent's estate or revocable trust, in  relevant instances, may include, but are not limited to, the following--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The transaction underlying the claim or expense occurs in the  ordinary course of business, is negotiated at arm's length, and is free  from donative intent.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The nature of the claim or expense is not related to an  expectation or claim of inheritance.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The claim or expense originates pursuant to an agreement between  the decedent and the family member, related entity, or beneficiary, and  the agreement is substantiated with contemporaneous evidence.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Performance by the claimant is pursuant to the terms of an  agreement between the decedent and the family member, related entity, or  beneficiary and the performance and the agreement can be substantiated.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> All amounts paid in satisfaction or settlement of a claim or  expense are reported by each party for Federal income and employment tax  purposes, to the extent appropriate, in a manner that is consistent with  the reported nature of the claim or expense.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  this paragraph (b)(2):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Family members include the spouse of the decedent; the  grandparents, parents, siblings, and lineal descendants of the decedent  or of the decedent's spouse; and the spouse and lineal descendants of  any such grandparent, parent, and sibling. Family members include  adopted individuals.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A related entity is an entity in which the decedent, either  directly or indirectly, had a beneficial ownership interest at the time  of the decedent's death or at any time during the three-year period  ending on the decedent's date of death. Such an entity, however, shall  not include a publicly-traded entity nor shall it include a closely-held  entity in which the combined beneficial interest, either direct or  indirect, of the decedent and the decedent's family members,  collectively, is less than 30 percent of the beneficial ownership  interests (whether voting or non-voting and whether an interest in  stock, capital and/or profits), as determined at the time a claim  described in this section is being asserted. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, an entity in which the decedent, directly or indirectly, had  any managing interest (for example, as a general partner of a  partnership or as a managing member of a limited liability company) at  the time of the decedent's death shall be considered a related entity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Beneficiaries of a decedent's estate include beneficiaries of a  trust of the decedent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> is  deductible to the extent it actually has been paid or will be paid,  subject to any applicable limitations in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Claims and expenses where court approval not required under  local law. A deduction for the amount of a claim or expense that is  otherwise deductible under section 2053 and these regulations will not  be denied under section 2053 solely because a local court decree has not  been entered with respect to such amount, provided that no court decree  is required under applicable law to determine the amount or allowability  of the claim or expense.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> is deductible to the extent it actually has been paid or  will be paid, subject to any applicable limitations in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> is  deductible to the extent it actually has been paid or will be paid,  subject to any applicable limitations in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Additional rules. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(i) through  (iv) of this section, additional rules may apply to the deductibility of  certain claims and expenses. See Sec. 20.2053-2 for additional rules  regarding the deductibility of funeral expenses. See Sec. 20.2053-3 for  additional rules regarding the deductibility of administration expenses.  See Sec. 20.2053-4 for additional rules regarding the deductibility of  claims against the estate. See Sec. 20.2053-7 for additional rules  regarding the deductibility of unpaid mortgages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples. Unless otherwise provided, assume that the amount of  any claim or expense is paid out of property subject to claims and is  paid within the time prescribed for filing the ``United States Estate  (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,'' Form 706. The following  examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b):</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Consent decree at variance with the law of the State.  Decedent's (D's) estate is probated in State. D's probate estate is  valued at $100x. State law provides that the executor's commission shall  not exceed 3 percent of the probate estate. A consent decree is entered  allowing the executor's commission in the amount of $5x. The estate pays  the executor's commission in the amount of $5x. For purposes of section  2053, the executor may deduct only $3x of the $5x expense paid for the  executor's commission because the amount approved by the consent decree  in excess of $3x is in excess of the applicable limit for executor's  commissions under local law. Therefore, for purposes of section 2053,  the consent decree may not be relied upon to establish the amount of the  expense for the executor's commission.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Decedent's (D's) estate is probated in State. State law  grants authority to an executor to administer an estate without court  approval, so long as notice of and a right to object to a proposed  action is provided to interested persons. The executor of D's estate (E)  proposes to sell property of the estate in order to pay the debts of D.  E gives requisite notice to all interested parties and no interested  person objects. E sells the real estate and pays a real estate  commission of $20x to a professional real estate agent. The amount of  the real estate commission paid does not exceed the applicable limit  under State law. Provided that the sale of the property was necessary to  pay D's debts, expenses of administration, or taxes, to preserve the  estate, or to effect distribution, the executor may deduct the $20x  expense for the real estate commission under section 2053 even though no  court decree was entered approving the expense.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Claim by family member. For a period of three years prior  to D's death, D's niece (N) provides accounting and bookkeeping services  on D's behalf. N is a CPA and provides similar accounting and  bookkeeping services to unrelated clients. At the end of each month, N  presents an itemized bill to D for services rendered. The fees charged  by N conform to the prevailing market rate for the services rendered and  are comparable to the fees N charges other clients for similar services.  The amount due is timely paid each month by D and is properly reported  for Federal income and employment tax purposes by N. In the six months  prior to D's death, D's poor health prevents D from making payments to N  for the amount due. After D's death, N asserts a claim against the  estate for $25x, an amount representing the amount due for the six-month  period prior to D's death. D's estate pays $25x to N in satisfaction of  the claim before the return is timely filed and N properly reports the  $25x received by E for income tax purposes. Barring any other relevant  facts or circumstances, E may rely on the following factors to establish  that the claim is bona fide: (1) N's claim for services rendered arose  in the ordinary course of business, as N is a CPA performing similar  services for other clients; (2) the fees charged were deemed to be  negotiated at arm's length, as the fees were consistent with the fees N  charged for similar services to unrelated clients; (3) the billing  records and the records of D's timely payments to N constitute  contemporaneous evidence of an agreement between D and N for N's  bookkeeping services; and (4) the amount of the payments to N is  properly reported by N for Federal income and employment tax purposes. E  may deduct the amount paid to N in satisfaction of the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em> to the sum of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The value of property included in the decedent's gross estate  and subject to claims, plus</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>  as meaning the property includible in the gross estate which, or the  avails of which, under the applicable law, would bear the burden of the  payment of these deductions in the final adjustment and settlement of  the decedent's estate. However, for the purposes of this definition, the  value of property subject to claims is first reduced by the amount of  any deduction allowed under section 2054 for any losses from casualty or  theft incurred during the settlement of the estate attributable to such  property. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example (1). The only item in the gross estate is real property  valued at $250,000 which the decedent and his surviving spouse held as  tenants by the entirety. Under the local law this real property is not  subject to claims. Funeral expenses of $1,200 and debts of the decedent  in the amount of $1,500 are allowable under local law. Before the  prescribed date for filing the estate tax return, the surviving spouse  paid the funeral expenses and $1,000 of the debts. The remaining $500 of  the debts was paid by her after the prescribed date for filing the  return. The total amount allowable as deductions under section 2053 is  limited to $2,200, the amount paid prior to the prescribed date for  filing the return.</p><p class="depth3">Example (2). The only two items in the gross estate were a bank  deposit of $20,000 and insurance in the amount of $150,000. The  insurance was payable to the decedent's surviving spouse and under local  law was not subject to claims. Funeral expenses of $1,000 and debts in  the amount of $29,000 were allowable under local law. A son was executor  of the estate and before the prescribed date for filing the estate tax  return he paid the funeral expenses of $9,000 of the debts, using  therefor $5,000 of the bank deposit and $5,000 supplied by the surviving  spouse. After the prescribed date for filing the return, the executor  paid the remaining $20,000 of the debts, using for that purpose the  $15,000 left in the bank account plus an additional $5,000 supplied by  the surviving spouse. The total amount allowable as deductions under  section 2053 is limited to $25,000 ($20,000 of property subject to  claims plus the $5,000 additional amount which, before the prescribed  date for filing the return, was paid out of property not subject to  claims).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amount deductible--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. To take into account  properly events occurring after the date of a decedent's death in  determining the amount deductible under section 2053 and these  regulations, the deduction for any claim or expense described in  paragraph (a) of this section is limited to the total amount actually  paid in settlement or satisfaction of that item (subject to any  applicable limitations in this section). However, see paragraph (d)(4)  of this section for the rules for deducting certain ascertainable  amounts; see Sec. 20.2053-4(b) and (c) for the rules regarding the  deductibility of certain claims against the estate; and see Sec.  20.2053-7 for the rules regarding the deductibility of unpaid mortgages  and other indebtedness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of post-death events. In determining whether and to  what extent a deduction under section 2053 is allowable, events  occurring after the date of a decedent's death will be taken into  consideration--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Until the expiration of the applicable period of limitations on  assessment prescribed in section 6501 (including without limitation at  all times during which the running of the period of limitations is  suspended); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> During subsequent periods, in determining the amount (if any)  of an overpayment of estate tax due in connection with a claim for  refund filed within the time prescribed in section 6511(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> in the deductible amount of a  claim or expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Exception for certain ascertainable amounts--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. A  deduction will be allowed for a claim or expense that satisfies all  applicable requirements even though it is not yet paid, provided that  the amount to be paid is ascertainable with reasonable certainty and  will be paid. For example, executors' commissions and attorneys' fees  that are not yet paid, and that meet the requirements for deductibility  under Sec. 20.2053-3(b) and (c), respectively, are deemed to be  ascertainable with reasonable certainty and may be deducted if such  expenses will be paid. However, no deduction may be taken upon the basis  of a vague or uncertain estimate. To the extent a claim or expense is  contested or contingent, such a claim or expense cannot be ascertained  with reasonable certainty.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effect of post-death events. A deduction under this paragraph  (d)(4) will be allowed to the extent the Commissioner is reasonably  satisfied that the amount to be paid is ascertainable with reasonable  certainty and will be paid. In making this determination, the  Commissioner will take into account events occurring after the date of a  decedent's death. To the extent the amount for which a deduction was  claimed does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d)(4), and  is not otherwise deductible, the deduction will be disallowed by the  Commissioner. If a deduction is claimed on Form 706 for an amount that  is not yet paid and the deduction is disallowed in whole or in part (or  if no deduction is claimed on Form 706), then if the claim or expense  subsequently satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (d)(4) or is  paid, relief may be sought by filing a claim for refund. To preserve the  estate's right to claim a refund for amounts becoming deductible after  the expiration of the period of limitation for the filing of a claim for  refund, a protective claim for refund may be filed in accordance with  paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Protective claim for refund--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A protective claim  for refund under this section may be filed at any time before the  expiration of the period of limitation prescribed in section 6511(a) for  the filing of a claim for refund to preserve the estate's right to claim  a refund by reason of claims or expenses that are not paid or do not  otherwise meet the requirements of deductibility under section 2053 and  these regulations until after the expiration of the period of limitation  for filing a claim for refund. Such a protective claim shall be made in  accordance with guidance that may be provided from time to time by  publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b)). Although the protective claim need not state a  particular dollar amount or demand an immediate refund, a protective  claim must identify each outstanding claim   or expense that would have been deductible under section 2053(a) or (b)  if such item already had been paid and must describe the reasons and  contingencies delaying the actual payment of the claim or expense.  Action on protective claims will proceed after the executor has notified  the Commissioner within a reasonable period that the contingency has  been resolved and that the amount deductible under Sec. 20.2053-1 has  been established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Effect on marital and charitable deduction. To the extent that  a protective claim for refund is filed with respect to a claim or  expense that would have been deductible under section 2053(a) or (b) if  such item already had been paid and that is payable out of a share that  meets the requirements for a charitable deduction under section 2055 or  a marital deduction under section 2056 or section 2056A, or from a  combination thereof, neither the charitable deduction nor the marital  deduction shall be reduced by the amount of such claim or expense until  the amount is actually paid or meets the requirements of paragraph  (d)(4) of this section for deducting certain ascertainable amounts or  the requirements of Sec. 20.2053-4(b) or (c) for deducting certain  claims against the estate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Examples. Assume that the amounts described in section 2053(a)  are payable out of property subject to claims and are allowable by the  law of the jurisdiction governing the administration of the estate,  whether the applicable jurisdiction is within or outside of the United  States. Assume that the claims against the estate are not deductible  under Sec. 20.2053-4(b) or (c). Also assume, unless otherwise provided,  that none of the limitations on the amount of the deduction described in  this section apply to the deduction claimed under section 2053. The  following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d):</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Amount of expense ascertainable. Decedent's (D's) estate  was probated in State. State law provides that the personal  representative shall receive compensation equal to 2.5 percent of the  value of the probate estate. The executor (E) may claim a deduction for  estimated fees equal to 2.5 percent of D's probate estate on the Form  706 filed for D's estate under the rule for deducting certain  ascertainable amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section,  provided that the estimated amount will be paid. However, the  Commissioner will disallow the deduction upon examination of the  estate's Form 706 to the extent that the amount for which a deduction  was claimed no longer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of  this section. If this occurs, E may file a protective claim for refund  in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section in order to preserve  the estate's right to claim a refund for the amount of the fee that is  subsequently paid or that subsequently meets the requirements of  paragraph (d)(4) of this section for deducting certain ascertainable  amounts.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Amount of claim not ascertainable. Prior to death,  Decedent (D) is sued by Claimant (C) for $100x in a tort proceeding and  responds asserting affirmative defenses available to D under applicable  local law. C and D are unrelated. D subsequently dies and D's Form 706  is due before a final judgment is entered in the case. The executor of  D's estate (E) may not claim a deduction with respect to C's claim on  D's Form 706 under the special rule contained in paragraph (d)(4) of  this section because the deductible amount cannot be ascertained with  reasonable certainty. However, E may file a timely protective claim for  refund in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section in order to  preserve the estate's right to subsequently claim a refund at the time a  final judgment is entered in the case and the claim is either paid or  meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section for deducting  certain ascertainable amounts.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Amount of claim payable out of property qualifying for  marital deduction. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that  the applicable credit amount, under section 2010, against the estate tax  was fully consumed by D's lifetime gifts, D is survived by Spouse (S),  and D's estate passes entirely to S in a bequest that qualifies for the  marital deduction under section 2056. Even though any amount D's estate  ultimately pays with respect to C's claim will be paid from the assets  qualifying for the marital deduction, in filing Form 706, E need not  reduce the amount of the marital deduction claimed on D's Form 706.  Instead, pursuant to the protective claim for refund filed by E, the  marital deduction will be reduced by the claim once a final judgment is  entered in the case. At that time, a deduction will be allowed for the  amount that is either paid or meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(4)  of this section for deducting certain ascertainable amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disallowance of double deductions. See section 642(g) and Sec.  1.642(g)-1 with respect to the disallowance for income   tax purposes of certain deductions unless the right to take such  deductions for estate tax purposes is waived.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to the  estates of decedents dying on or after October 20, 2009.  [T.D. 6296, 23 FR 4529, June 24, 1958, as amended by T.D. 7238, 37 FR  28719, Dec. 29, 1972; T.D. 9468, 74 FR 53657, Oct. 20, 2009; T.D. 9468,  74 FR 61525, Nov. 25, 2009]</p>
