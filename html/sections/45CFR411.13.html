Video monitoring equipment may not be placed in any bathroom, shower or bathing area, or other area where UCs routinely undress.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Care provider facilities must conduct frequent unannounced rounds to identify and deter sexual abuse and sexual harassment. Such rounds must be implemented during night as well as day shifts.
