                            <p class="depth0">Section 9 of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989 amended  section 16(e) of the Act to provide that any person who repeatedly or  willfully violates the minimum wage (section 6) or overtime provisions  (section 7) of the Act shall be subject to a civil money penalty not to  exceed $1,000 for each such violation. The Federal Civil Penalties  Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410), as amended by the  Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, section  31001(s)), requires that inflationary adjustments be periodically made  in these civil money penalties according to a specified cost-of-living  formula. This part defines terms necessary for administration of the  civil money penalty provisions, describes the violations for which a  penalty may be imposed, and describes criteria for determining the  amount of penalty to be assessed. The procedural requirements for  assessing and contesting such penalties are contained in 29 CFR part  580.  [66 FR 63503, Dec. 7, 2001]</p>
