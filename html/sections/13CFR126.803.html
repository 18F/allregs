                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of receipt of protest. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SBA immediately will notify  the contracting officer and the protestor of the date SBA receives a  protest and whether SBA will process the protest or dismiss it in  accordance with Sec. 126.804.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If SBA determines the protest is timely and sufficiently  specific, SBA   will notify the protested HUBZone SBC of the protest and the identity of  the protestor. The protested HUBZone SBC may submit information  responsive to the protest within 5 business days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time period for determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> SBA will determine the  HUBZone status of the protested HUBZone SBC within 15 business days  after receipt of a protest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer may award a contract after receipt of a  protest if the contracting officer determines in writing that an award  must be made to protect the public interest. Notwithstanding such a  determination, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply to  the procurement in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If SBA does not issue its determination within 15 business days  (or request an extension that is granted), the contracting officer may  award the contract if he or she determines in writing that there is an  immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes  its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.  Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (d) of  this section apply to the procurement in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of determination. SBA will notify the contracting  officer, the protestor, and the protested concern of its determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effect of determination. The determination is effective  immediately and is final unless overturned on appeal by the AA/GC&BD;, or  designee, pursuant to Sec. 126.805. If SBA upholds the protest, SBA will  decertify the concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A contracting officer may award a contract to a protested  concern after the D/HUB has determined either that the protested concern  is an eligible HUBZone or has dismissed all protests against it. If the  AA/GCBD subsequently overturns the initial determination or dismissal,  the contracting officer may apply the appeal decision to the procurement  in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A contracting officer shall not award a contract to a protested  concern that the D/HUB has determined is not an eligible HUBZone for the  procurement in question.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a contracting officer receives such a determination after  contract award, and no appeal has been filed, the contracting officer  shall terminate the award.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a timely appeal is filed after contract award, the  contracting officer must consider whether performance can be suspended  until an appellate decision is rendered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the AA/GCBD affirms the initial determination finding the  protested concern ineligible, the contracting officer shall either  terminate the contract or not exercise the next option.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The contracting officer must update the Federal Procurement Data  System and other procurement reporting databases to reflect the final  agency HUBZone decision (the D/HUB's decision if no appeal is filed or  the decision of the AA/GCBD).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A concern found to be ineligible is precluded from applying for  HUBZone certification for ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the  final agency decision (the D/HUB's decision if no appeal is filed or the  decision of the AA/GCBD).
