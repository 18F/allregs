sentence in the annual report or to use verification software according to Sec. 98.5(b) in lieu of reporting these data. If you elect to use this verification software, you must use the verification software according to Sec. 98.5(b) for all of these data that apply to the stationary fuel combustion source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Units that use the four tiers. You shall report the following information for stationary combustion units that use the Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, or Tier 4 methodology in Sec. 98.33(a) to calculate CO2 emissions, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The unit ID number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A code representing the type of unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Maximum rated heat input capacity of the unit, in mmBtu/hr.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each type of fuel combusted in the unit during the report year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The methodology (i.e., tier) used to calculate the CO2 emissions for each type of fuel combusted (i.e., Tier 1, 2, 3, or 4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The methodology start date, for each fuel type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The methodology end date, for each fuel type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> For a unit that uses Tiers 1, 2, or 3:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The annual CO2 mass emissions (including biogenic CO2), and the annual CH4, and N2O mass emissions for each type of fuel combusted during the reporting year, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO2e; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Metric tons of biogenic CO2 emissions (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> For a unit that uses Tier 4:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the total annual CO2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS consists entirely of non-biogenic CO2 (i.e., CO2 from fossil fuel combustion plus, if applicable, CO2 from sorbent and/or process CO2), report the total annual CO2 mass emissions, expressed in metric tons. You are not required to report the combustion CO2 emissions by fuel type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Report the total annual CO2 mass emissions measured by the CEMS.

You may use any of the applicable reporting alternatives of this paragraph to simplify the unit-level reporting required under paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Aggregation of units. If a facility contains two or more units (e.g., boilers or combustion turbines), each of which has a maximum rated heat input capacity of 250 mmBtu/hr or less, you may report the combined GHG emissions for the group of units in lieu of reporting GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the use of Tier 4 is not required or elected for any of the units and the units use the same tier for any common fuels combusted. If this option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Group ID number, beginning with the prefix ``GP''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)-(iii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The highest maximum rated heat input capacity of any unit in the group (mmBtu/hr).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Each type of fuel combusted in the group of units during the reporting year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Annual CO2 mass emissions and annual CH4, and N2O mass emissions, aggregated for each type of fuel combusted in the group of units during the report year, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO2e.

When the flue gases from two or more stationary fuel combustion units at a facility are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere and if CEMS are used to continuously monitor CO2 mass emissions at the common stack or duct according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology, you may report the combined emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units. This monitoring and reporting alternative may also be used when process off-gases or a mixture of combustion products and process gases are combined together in a common stack or duct before exiting to the atmosphere. Whenever the common stack or duct monitoring option is applied, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Common stack or duct identification number, beginning with the prefix ``CS''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Number of units sharing the common stack or duct. Report ``1'' when the flue gas flowing through the common stack or duct includes combustion products and/or process off-gases, and all of the effluent comes from a single unit (e.g., a furnace, kiln, petrochemical production unit, or smelter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Combined maximum rated heat input capacity of the units sharing the common stack or duct (mmBtu/hr).

If any of the units burn both fossil fuels and biomass, separately report the annual non-biogenic CO2 mass emissions (i.e., CO2 from fossil fuel combustion plus, if applicable, CO2 from sorbent and/or process CO2) and the annual CO2 mass emissions from biomass combustion, each expressed in metric tons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> An estimate of the heat input from each type of fuel listed in Table C-2 of this subpart that was combusted in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> For each type of fuel listed in Table C-2 of this subpart that was combusted during the report year in the units sharing the common stack or duct during the report year, the annual CH4 and N2O mass emissions from the units sharing the common stack or duct, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO2e.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> If applicable, the plant code (as defined in Sec. 98.6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Common pipe configurations. When two or more stationary combustion units at a facility combust the same type of liquid or gaseous fuel and the fuel is fed to the individual units through a common supply line or pipe, you may report the combined emissions from the units served by the common supply line, in lieu of separately reporting the GHG emissions from the individual units, provided that the total amount of fuel combusted by the units is accurately measured at the common pipe or supply line using a fuel flow meter, or, for natural gas, the amount of fuel combusted may be obtained from gas billing records. For Tier 3 applications, the flow meter shall be calibrated in accordance with Sec. 98.34(b). If a portion of the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line is diverted to either: A flare; or another

stationary fuel combustion unit (or units), including units that use a CO2 mass emissions calculation method in part 75 of this chapter; or a chemical or industrial process (where it is used as a raw material but not combusted), and the remainder of the fuel is distributed to a group of combustion units for which you elect to use the common pipe reporting option, you may use company records to subtract out the diverted portion of the fuel from the fuel measured (or obtained from gas billing records) at the main supply line prior to performing the GHG emissions calculations for the group of units using the common pipe option. If the diverted portion of the fuel is combusted, the GHG emissions from the diverted portion shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable provisions of this part. When the common pipe option is selected, the applicable tier shall be used based on the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit served by the common pipe configuration, except where the applicable tier is based on criteria other than unit size. For example, if the maximum rated heat input capacity of the largest unit is greater than 250 mmBtu/hr, Tier 3 will apply, unless the fuel transported through the common pipe is natural gas or distillate oil, in which case Tier 2 may be used, in accordance with Sec. 98.33(b)(2)(ii). As a second example, in accordance with Sec. 98.33(b)(1)(v), Tier 1 may be used regardless of unit size when natural gas is transported through the common pipe, if the annual fuel consumption is obtained from gas billing records in units of therms or mmBtu. When the common pipe reporting option is selected, the following information shall be reported instead of the information in paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Common pipe identification number, beginning with the prefix ``CP''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The highest maximum rated heat input capacity of any unit served by the common pipe (mmBtu/hr).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The fuels combusted in the units during the reporting year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The methodology used to calculate the CO2 mass emissions (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If the any of the units burns both fossil fuels and biomass, the annual CO2 mass emissions from combustion of all fossil fuels and annual CO2 emissions from combustion of all biomass fuels from the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric tons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Annual CO2 mass emissions and annual CH4 and N2O emissions from each fuel type for the units served by the common pipe, expressed in metric tons of each gas and in metric tons of CO2e.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Methodology start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Methodology end date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> If applicable, the plant code (as defined in Sec. 98.6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The following alternative reporting option applies to facilities at which a common liquid or gaseous fuel supply is shared between one or more large combustion units, such as boilers or combustion turbines (including units subject to subpart D of this part and other units subject to part 75 of this chapter) and small combustion sources, including, but not limited to, space heaters, hot water heaters, and lab burners. In this case, you may simplify reporting by attributing all of the GHG emissions from combustion of the shared fuel to the large combustion unit(s), provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total quantity of the fuel combusted during the report year in the units sharing the fuel supply is measured, either at the ``gate'' to the facility or at a point inside the facility, using a fuel flow meter, billing meter, or tank drop measurements (as applicable);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On an annual basis, at least 95 percent (by mass or volume) of the shared fuel is combusted in the large combustion unit(s), and the remainder is combusted in the small combustion sources. Company records may be used to determine the percentage distribution of the shared fuel to the large and small units; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The use of this reporting option is documented in the Monitoring Plan required under Sec. 98.3(g)(5). Indicate in the Monitoring Plan which units share the common fuel supply and the method used to demonstrate that this alternative reporting option applies. For the small combustion sources, a description of the types of units and the

approximate number of units is sufficient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Units subject to part 75 of this chapter.
