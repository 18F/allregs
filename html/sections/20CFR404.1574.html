                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> through (d) of this section that are relevant to your  work activity. We will use these provisions whenever they are  appropriate, whether in connection with your application for disability  benefits (when we make an initial determination on your application and  throughout any appeals you may request), after you have become entitled  to a period of disability or to disability benefits, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Your earnings may show you have done substantial gainful  activity. Generally, in evaluating your work activity for substantial  gainful activity purposes, our primary consideration will be the  earnings you derive from the work activity. We will use your earnings to  determine whether you have done substantial gainful activity unless we  have information from you, your employer, or others that shows that we  should not count all of your earnings. The amount of your earnings from  work you have done (regardless of whether it is unsheltered or sheltered  work) may show that you have engaged in substantial gainful activity.  Generally, if you worked for substantial earnings, we will find that you  are able to do substantial gainful activity. However, the fact that your  earnings were not substantial will not necessarily show that you are not  able to do substantial gainful activity. We generally consider work that  you are forced to stop or to reduce below the substantial gainful  activity level after a short time because of your impairment to be an  unsuccessful work attempt. Your earnings from an unsuccessful work  attempt will not show that you are able to do substantial gainful  activity. We will use the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section to  determine if the work you did was an unsuccessful work attempt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> We consider only the amounts you earn. When we decide whether  your earnings show that you have done substantial gainful activity, we  do not consider any income that is not directly related to your  productivity. When your earnings exceed the reasonable value of the work  you perform, we consider only that part of your pay which you actually  earn. If your earnings are being subsidized, we do not consider the  amount of the subsidy when we determine if your earnings show that you  have done substantial gainful activity. We consider your work to be  subsidized if the true value of your work, when compared with the same  or similar work done by unimpaired persons, is less than the actual  amount of earnings paid to you for your work. For example, when a person  with a serious impairment does simple tasks under close and continuous  supervision, our determination of whether that person has done  substantial gainful activity will not be based only on the amount of the  wages paid. We will first determine whether the person received a  subsidy; that is, we will determine whether the person was being paid  more than the reasonable value of the actual services performed. We will  then subtract the value of the subsidy from the person's gross earnings  to determine the earnings we will use to determine if he or she has done  substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you are working in a sheltered or special environment. If you  are working in a sheltered workshop, you may or may not be earning the  amounts you are being paid. The fact that the sheltered workshop or  similar facility is operating at a loss or is receiving some charitable  contributions or governmental aid does not establish that you are not  earning all you are being paid. Since persons in military service being  treated for severe impairments usually continue to receive full pay, we  evaluate work activity in a therapy program or while on limited duty by  comparing it with similar work in the civilian work force or on the  basis of reasonable worth of the work, rather than on the actual amount  of the earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Earnings guidelines--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. If you are an employee, we  first consider the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and  Sec. 404.1576, and then the guides in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this  section. When we review your earnings to determine if you have been  performing substantial gainful activity, we will subtract the value of  any subsidized earnings (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and the  reasonable cost of any impairment-related work expenses from your gross  earnings (see Sec. 404.1576). The resulting amount is the amount we use  to determine if you have done substantial gainful activity. We will  generally average your earnings for comparison with the earnings  guidelines in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. See  Sec. 404.1574a for our rules on averaging earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Earnings that will ordinarily show that you have engaged in  substantial gainful activity. We will consider that your earnings from  your work activity as an employee (including earnings   from work in a sheltered workshop or a comparable facility especially  set up for severely impaired persons) show that you engaged in  substantial gainful activity if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Before January 1, 2001, they averaged more than the amount(s) in  Table 1 of this section for the time(s) in which you worked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Beginning January 1, 2001, and each year thereafter, they  average more than the larger of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount for the previous year, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An amount adjusted for national wage growth, calculated by  multiplying $700 by the ratio of the national average wage index for the  year 2 calendar years before the year for which the amount is being  calculated to the national average wage index for the year 1998. We will  then round the resulting amount to the next higher multiple of $10 where  such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest  multiple of $10 in any other case.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Your monthly</p><p class="depth0">earnings</p><p class="depth0">For months:                         averaged more</p><p class="depth0">than: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In calendar years before 1976...........................            $200 In calendar year 1976...................................             230 In calendar year 1977...................................             240 In calendar year 1978...................................             260 In calendar year 1979...................................             280 In calendar years 1980-1989.............................             300 January 1990-June 1999..................................             500 July 1999-December 2000.................................             700 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Earnings that will ordinarily show that you have not engaged in  substantial gainful activity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. If your average monthly  earnings are equal to or less than the amount(s) determined under  paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the year(s) in which you work, we  will generally consider that the earnings from your work as an employee  (including earnings from work in a sheltered workshop or comparable  facility) will show that you have not engaged in substantial gainful  activity. We will generally not consider other information in addition  to your earnings except in the circumstances described in paragraph  (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When we will consider other information in addition to your  earnings. We will generally consider other information in addition to  your earnings if there is evidence indicating that you may be engaging  in substantial gainful activity or that you are in a position to control  when earnings are paid to you or the amount of wages paid to you (for  example, if you are working for a small corporation owned by a  relative). (See paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section for when we do not  apply this rule.) Examples of other information we may consider include,  whether--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Your work is comparable to that of unimpaired people in your  community who are doing the same or similar occupations as their means  of livelihood, taking into account the time, energy, skill, and  responsibility involved in the work; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Your work, although significantly less than that done by  unimpaired people, is clearly worth the amounts shown in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section, according to pay scales in your community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for considering earnings alone when evaluating  the work you do after you have received social security disability  benefits for at least 24 months. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of  this section, we will not consider other information in addition to your  earnings to evaluate the work you are doing or have done if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the time you do the work, you are entitled to social security  disability benefits and you have received such benefits for at least 24  months (see paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> We are evaluating that work to consider whether you have engaged  in substantial gainful activity or demonstrated the ability to engage in  substantial gainful activity for the purpose of determining whether your  disability has ceased because of your work activity (see  Secs. 404.1592a(a)(1) and (3)(ii) and 404.1594(d)(5) and (f)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> When we consider you to have received social security  disability benefits for at least 24 months. For purposes of paragraph  (b)(3)(iii) of this section, social security disability benefits means   disability insurance benefits for a disabled worker, child's insurance  benefits based on disability, or widow's or widower's insurance benefits  based on disability. We consider you to have received such benefits for  at least 24 months beginning with the first day of the first month  following the 24th month for which you actually received social security  disability benefits that you were due or constructively received such  benefits. The 24 months do not have to be consecutive. We will consider  you to have constructively received a benefit for a month for purposes  of the 24-month requirement if you were otherwise due a social security  disability benefit for that month and your monthly benefit was withheld  to recover an overpayment. Any months for which you were entitled to  benefits but for which you did not actually or constructively receive a  benefit payment will not be counted for the 24-month requirement. If you  also receive supplemental security income payments based on disability  or blindness under title XVI of the Social Security Act, months for  which you received only supplemental security income payments will not  be counted for the 24-month requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The unsuccessful work attempt--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. Ordinarily, work you  have done will not show that you are able to do substantial gainful  activity if, after working for a period of 6 months or less, your  impairment forced you to stop working or to reduce the amount of work  you do so that your earnings from such work fall below the substantial  gainful activity earnings level in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and  you meet the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), (4), and  (5), of this section. We will use the provisions of this paragraph when  we make an initial determination on your application for disability  benefits and throughout any appeal you may request. Except as set forth  in Sec. 404.1592a(a), we will also apply the provisions of this  paragraph if you are already entitled to disability benefits, when you  work and we consider whether the work you are doing is substantial  gainful activity or demonstrates the ability to do substantial gainful  activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Event that must precede an unsuccessful work attempt. There must  be a significant break in the continuity of your work before we will  consider that you began a work attempt that later proved unsuccessful.  You must have stopped working or reduced your work and earnings below  the substantial gainful activity earnings level because of your  impairment or because of the removal of special conditions that were  essential to the further performance of your work. We explain what we  mean by special conditions in Sec. 404.1573(c). We will consider your  prior work to be ``discontinued'' for a significant period if you were  out of work at least 30 consecutive days. We will also consider your  prior work to be ``discontinued'' if, because of your impairment, you  were forced to change to another type of work or another employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you worked 3 months or less. We will consider work of 3  months or less to be an unsuccessful work attempt if you stopped  working, or you reduced your work and earnings below the substantial  gainful activity earnings level, because of your impairment or because  of the removal of special conditions which took into account your  impairment and permitted you to work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If you worked between 3 and 6 months. We will consider work that  lasted longer than 3 months to be an unsuccessful work attempt if it  ended, or was reduced below substantial gainful activity earnings level,  within 6 months because of your impairment or because of the removal of  special conditions which took into account your impairment and permitted  you to work and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You were frequently absent from work because of your impairment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your work was unsatisfactory because of your impairment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You worked during a period of temporary remission of your  impairment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You worked under special conditions that were essential to your  performance and these conditions were removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If you worked more than 6 months. We will not consider work you  performed at the substantial gainful activity earnings level for more  than 6   months to be an unsuccessful work attempt regardless of why it ended or  was reduced below the substantial gainful activity earnings level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Work activity in certain volunteer programs. If you work as a  volunteer in certain programs administered by the Federal government  under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 or the Small Business  Act, we will not count any payments you receive from these programs as  earnings when we determine whether you are engaging in substantial  gainful activity. These payments may include a minimal stipend, payments  for supportive services such as housing, supplies and equipment, an  expense allowance, or reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. We will  also disregard the services you perform as a volunteer in applying any  of the substantial gainful activity tests discussed in paragraph (b)(6)  of this section. This exclusion from the substantial gainful activity  provisions will apply only if you are a volunteer in a program  explicitly mentioned in the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 or  the Small Business Act. Programs explicitly mentioned in those Acts  include Volunteers in Service to America, University Year for ACTION,  Special Volunteer Programs, Retired Senior Volunteer Program, Foster  Grandparent Program, Service Corps of Retired Executives, and Active  Corps of Executives. We will not exclude under this paragraph, volunteer  work you perform in other programs or any nonvolunteer work you may  perform, including nonvolunteer work under one of the specified  programs. For civilians in certain government-sponsored job training and  employment programs, we evaluate the work activity on a case-by-case  basis under the substantial gainful activity earnings test. In programs  such as these, subsidies often occur. We will subtract the value of any  subsidy and use the remainder to determine if you have done substantial  gainful activity. See paragraphs (a)(2)-(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Work activity as a member or consultant of an advisory committee  established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C.  App. 2. If you are serving as a member or consultant of an advisory  committee, board, commission, council, or similar group established  under FACA, we will not count any payments you receive from serving on  such committees as earnings when we determine whether you are engaging  in substantial gainful activity. These payments may include  compensation, travel expenses, and special assistance. We also will  exclude the services you perform as a member or consultant of an  advisory committee established under FACA in applying any of the  substantial gainful activity tests discussed in paragraph (b)(6) of this  section. This exclusion from the substantial gainful activity provisions  will apply only if you are a member or consultant of an advisory  committee specifically authorized by statute, or by the President, or  determined as a matter of formal record by the head of a federal  government agency. This exclusion from the substantial gainful activity  provisions will not apply if your service as a member or consultant of  an advisory committee is part of your duties or is required as an  employee of any governmental or non-governmental organization, agency,  or business.  [46 FR 4869, Jan. 19, 1981, as amended at 48 FR 21936, May 16, 1983; 49  FR 22272, May 29, 1984; 54 FR 53605, Dec. 29, 1989; 64 FR 18570, Apr.  15, 1999; 64 FR 22903, Apr. 28, 1999; 65 FR 42783, July 11, 2000; 65 FR  82910, Dec. 29, 2000; 71 FR 3219, Jan. 20, 2006; 71 FR 66853, Nov. 17,  2006]    Sec. 404.1574a  When and how we will average your earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If your work as an employee or as a self-employed person was  continuous without significant change in work patterns or earnings, and  there has been no change in the substantial gainful activity earnings  levels, we will average your earnings over the entire period of work  requiring evaluation to determine if you have done substantial gainful  activity. See Sec. 404.1592a for information on the reentitlement  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If you work over a period of time during which the substantial  gainful activity earnings levels change, we will average your earnings  separately for each period in which a different substantial gainful  activity earnings level applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If there is a significant change in your work pattern or  earnings during   the period of work requiring evaluation, we will average your earnings  over each separate period of work to determine if any of your work  efforts were substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> We will not average your earnings in determining whether  benefits should be paid for any month(s) during or after the  reentitlement period that occurs after the month disability has been  determined to have ceased because of the performance of substantial  gainful activity. See Sec. 404.1592a for information on the  reentitlement period. The following examples illustrate what we mean by  a significant change in the work pattern of an employee and when we will  average and will not average earnings.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1: Mrs. H. began receiving disability insurance benefits in  March 1993. In January 1995 she began selling magazines by telephone  solicitation, expending a minimum of time, for which she received $225  monthly. As a result, Mrs. H. used up her trial work period during the  months of January 1995 through September 1995. After the trial work  period ended, we determined that Mrs. H. had not engaged in substantial  gainful activity during her trial work period. Her reentitlement period  began October 1995. In December 1995, Mrs. H. discontinued her telephone  solicitation work to take a course in secretarial skills. In January  1997, she began work as a part-time temporary secretary in a banking  firm. Mrs. H. worked 20 hours a week, without any subsidy or impairment- related work expenses, at beginner rates. She earned $285 per month in  January 1997 and February 1997. In March 1997 she had increased her  secretarial skills to journeyman level and was assigned as a part-time  private secretary to one of the vice presidents of the banking firm.  Mrs. H.'s earnings increased to $525 per month effective March 1997. We  determined that Mrs. H. was engaging in substantial gainful activity  beginning March 1997 and that her disability ceased that month, the  first month of substantial gainful activity after the end of the trial  work period. Mrs. H. is due payment for March 1997, the month of  cessation, and the following 2 months (April 1997 and May 1997) because  disability benefits terminate the third month following the earliest  month in which she performed substantial gainful activity. We did not  average earnings for the period January 1997 and February 1997 with the  period beginning March 1997 because there was a significant change in  earnings and work activity beginning March 1997. Thus, the earnings of  January 1997 and February 1997 could not be averaged with those of March  1997 to reduce March 1997 earnings below the substantial gainful  activity level. After we determine that Mrs. H.'s disability had ceased  because of her performance of substantial gainful activity, we cannot  average her earnings to determine whether she is due payment for any  month during or after the reentitlement period. Beginning June 1997, the  third month following the cessation month, we would evaluate all of Mrs.  H.'s work activity on a month-by-month basis (see Sec. 404.1592a(a)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: Ms. M. began receiving disability insurance benefits in  March 1992. In January 1995, she began selling cable television  subscriptions by telephone solicitation, expending a minimum of time,  for which she received $275 monthly. Ms. M. did not work in June 1995,  and she resumed selling cable television subscriptions beginning July  1995. In this way, Ms. M. used up her 9-month trial work period during  the months of January 1995 through May 1995 and July 1995 through  October 1995. After Ms. M.'s trial work period ended, we determined that  she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity during her trial  work period. Ms. M.'s reentitlement period began November 1995. In  December 1995, Ms. M. discontinued her telephone solicitation work to  take a course in secretarial skills. In January 1997, she began work as  a part-time temporary secretary in an accounting firm. Ms. M. worked,  without any subsidy or impairment-related work expenses, at beginner  rates. She earned $460 in January 1997, $420 in February 1997, and $510  in March 1997. In April 1997, she had increased her secretarial skills  to journeyman level, and she was assigned as a part-time private  secretary to one of the vice presidents of the firm. Ms. M.'s earnings  increased to $860 per month effective April 1997. We determined that Ms.  M. was engaging in substantial gainful activity beginning April 1997 and  that her disability ceased that month, the first month of substantial  gainful activity after the end of the trial work period. She is due  payment for April 1997, May 1997 and June 1997, because disability  benefits terminate the third month following the earliest month in which  she performs substantial gainful activity (the month of cessation). We  averaged her earnings for the period January 1997 through March 1997 and  determined them to be about $467 per month for that period. We did not  average earnings for the period January 1997 through March 1997 with  earnings for the period beginning April 1997 because there was a  significant change in work activity and earnings beginning April 1997.  Therefore, we found that the earnings for January 1997 through March  1997 were under the substantial gainful activity level. After we  determine that Ms M.'s disability has ceased because she performed  substantial gainful activity, we cannot average her earnings in  determining whether she is due payment for any month during or   after the reentitlement period. In this example, beginning July 1997,  the third month following the month of cessation, we would evaluate all  of Ms. M.'s work activity on a month-by-month basis (see  Sec. 404.1592a(a)).
