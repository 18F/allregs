The union representatives will not be permitted to conduct meetings,  collect union dues, or make speeches concerning union matters while  visiting a work site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever a union representative is denied entry to a work site,  the person denying entry shall make a written report to the DOT labor  coordinator, the Office of the General Counsel, Office of Environmental  Law, Civil Rights and General Law (C-10), within the Office of the  Secretary of Transportation or corresponding OA labor advisor, within  two working days after the request for entry is denied. The report shall  include the reason(s) for the denial, the name of the representative  denied entry, the union affiliation and number, and the name and title  of the person that denied the entry.</p>
