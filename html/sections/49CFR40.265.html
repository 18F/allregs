                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an employee does not provide a sufficient amount of breath to permit a valid breath test, you must take the steps listed in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As the BAT or STT, you must instruct the employee to attempt again to provide a sufficient amount of

breath and about the proper way to do so.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the employee refuses to make the attempt, you must discontinue the test, note the fact on the ``Remarks'' line of the ATF, and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the employee again attempts and fails to provide a sufficient amount of breath, you may provide another opportunity to the employee to do so if you believe that there is a strong likelihood that it could result in providing a sufficient amount of breath.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the employee's attempts under paragraph (b)(2) of this section have failed to produce a sufficient amount of breath, you must note the fact on the ``Remarks'' line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you are using an EBT that has the capability of operating manually, you may attempt to conduct the test in manual mode.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you are qualified to use a saliva ASD and you are in the screening test stage, you may change to a saliva ASD only to complete the screening test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As the employer, when the BAT or STT informs you that the employee has not provided a sufficient amount of breath, you must direct the employee to obtain, within five days, an evaluation from a licensed physician who is acceptable to you and who has expertise in the medical issues raised by the employee's failure to provide a sufficient specimen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You are required to provide the physician who will conduct the evaluation with the following information and instructions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That the employee was required to take a DOT breath alcohol test, but was unable to provide a sufficient amount of breath to complete the test;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consequences of the appropriate DOT agency regulation for refusing to take the required alcohol test;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> That the physician must provide you with a signed statement of his or her conclusions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> That the physician, in his or her reasonable medical judgment, must base those conclusions on one of the following determinations:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of breath. The physician must not include in the signed statement detailed information on the employee's medical condition. In this case, the test is cancelled.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> There is not an adequate basis for determining that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of breath. This constitutes a refusal to test.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section, a medical condition includes an ascertainable physiological condition (e.g., a respiratory system dysfunction) or a medically documented pre-existing psychological disorder, but does not include unsupported assertions of ``situational anxiety'' or hyperventilation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As the physician making the evaluation, after making your determination, you must provide a written statement of your conclusions and the basis for them to the DER directly (and not through a C/TPA acting as an itermediary). You must not include in this statement detailed information on the employee's medical condition beyond what is necessary to explain your conclusion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt of the report from the examining physician, as the DER you must immediately inform the employee and take appropriate action based upon your DOT agency regulations.</p>
