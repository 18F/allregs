                            <p class="depth0">Service is valid unless the enlistment is voided by the service  department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Enlistment not prohibited by statute. Where an enlistment is  voided by the service department for reasons other than those stated in  paragraph (b) of this section, service is valid from the date of entry  upon active duty to the date of voidance by the service department.  Benefits may not be paid, however, unless the discharge is held to have  been under conditions other than dishonorable. Generally discharge for  concealment of a physical or mental defect except incompetency or  insanity which would have prevented enlistment will be held to be under  dishonorable conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Statutory prohibition. Where an enlistment is voided by the  service department because the person did not have legal capacity to  contract for a reason other than minority (as in the case of an insane  person) or because the enlistment was prohibited by statute (a deserter  or person convicted of a felony), benefits may not be paid based   on that service even though a disability was incurred during such  service. An undesirable discharge by reason of the fraudulent enlistment  voids the enlistment from the beginning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Misrepresentation of age. Active service which was terminated  because of concealment of minority or misrepresentation of age is  honorable if the veteran was released from service under conditions  other than dishonorable. Service is valid from the date of entry upon  active duty to the date of discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Honorable discharges. Determinations as to honorable service  will be made by the service departments and the finding shall be binding  on the Department of Veterans Affairs, but, in the case of an alien, the  effect of the discharge will be governed by Sec.  3.7(b).
