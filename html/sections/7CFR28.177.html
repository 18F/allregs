The same applicant shall not file more than one request for the classification or comparison of the same cotton within any 30-day period except for a review classification or comparison as provided in Sec. 28.181. All requests for classification or comparison in the United States shall be filed with the Classing Office which serves the territory in which the samples are located. If the cotton is stored outside the United States the request shall be filed with the Classing Office designated by the Director. The Area Director of any Classing Office may refer any request and the samples submitted to another office or to the Quality Control Section for classification or comparison.
