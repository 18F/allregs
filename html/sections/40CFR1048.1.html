                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in this part 1048 apply for all new, spark- ignition nonroad engines (defined in Sec.  1048.801) with maximum engine  power above 19 kW, except as provided in Sec.  1048.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part 1048 applies for engines built on or after January 1,  2004. You need not follow this part for engines you produce before  January 1, 2004. See Sec. Sec.  1048.101 through 1048.115, Sec.   1048.145, and the definition of model year in Sec.  1048.801 for more  information about the timing of new requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The definition of nonroad engine in 40 CFR 1068.30 excludes  certain engines used in stationary applications. These engines may be  required by 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ, to comply with some of the  provisions of this part 1048; otherwise, these engines are only required  to comply with the requirements in Sec.  1048.20. In addition, the  prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101 restrict the use of stationary engines  for nonstationary purposes unless they are certified under this part  1048 to the same standards that would apply to nonroad engines for the  same model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In certain cases, the regulations in this part 1048 apply to  engines with maximum engine power at or below 19 kW that would otherwise  be covered by 40 CFR part 90 or 1054. See 40 CFR 90.913 or 1054.615 for  provisions related to this allowance.  [70 FR 40465, July 13, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 3613, Jan. 18, 2008; 73  FR 59231, Oct. 8, 2008]</p>
