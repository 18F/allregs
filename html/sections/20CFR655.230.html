The SWA must conduct a housing inspection no less frequently than once every three calendar years after the initial inspection and provide documentation to the employer certifying the housing for a period lasting no more than 36 months. If the SWA determines that an employer's housing cannot be inspected within a 3-year timeframe or, when it is inspected, the housing does not meet all the applicable standards, the CO may deny the H-2A application in full or in part or require additional inspections, to be carried out by the SWA, in order to satisfy the regulatory requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> The employer may self-certify its compliance with the standards contained in Sec.  655.235 only when the employer has received a certification from the SWA for the range housing it seeks to use within the past 36 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employer may self-certify its compliance with the standards contained in Sec.  655.235 only when the employer has received a certification from the SWA for the range housing it seeks to use within the past 36 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To self-certify the range housing, the employer must submit a copy of the valid SWA housing certification and a written statement, signed and dated by the employer, to the SWA and the CO assuring that the housing is available, sufficient to accommodate the number of workers being requested for temporary labor certification, and meets all the applicable standards for range housing contained in Sec.  655.235.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The use of range housing at a location other than the range, where fixed site employer-provided housing would otherwise be required, is permissible only when the worker occupying the housing is performing work that constitutes the production of livestock (which includes work that is closely and directly related to herding and/or the production of livestock). In such a situation, workers must be granted access to facilities, including but not limited to toilets and showers with hot and cold water under pressure, as well as cooking and cleaning facilities, that would satisfy the requirements contained in Sec.  655.122(d)(1)(i). When such work does not constitute the production of livestock, workers must be housed in housing that meets all the requirements of Sec.  655.122(d).</p>
