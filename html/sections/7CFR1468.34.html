NRCS will determine the geographic area rate cap using the best information which is readily available in that State. Such information may include: soil types, types of crops capable of being grown, production history, location, real estate market values, and tax rates and assessments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptance of offered easement compensation. (1) NRCS will not acquire any easement unless the landowner accepts the amount of the easement payment offered by NRCS. The easement payment may or may not equal the fair market value of the interests and rights to be conveyed by the landowner under the easement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> For easements or 30-year contracts valued at $500,000 or less, NRCS will provide compensation in up to 10 annual payments, as requested by the participant, as specified in the agreement to purchase or agreement to enter 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For easements or 30-year contracts valued at $500,000 or less, NRCS will provide compensation in up to 10 annual payments, as requested by the participant, as specified in the agreement to purchase or agreement to enter 30-year contract between NRCS and the participant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For easements or 30-year contracts valued at more than $500,000, NRCS may provide compensation in at least 5, but not more than 10 annual

payments. NRCS may provide compensation in a single payment for such easements or 30-year contracts when, as determined by the NRCS Chief, it would further the purposes of the program. The applicable payment schedule will be specified in the agreement to purchase a conservation easement (APCE) or agreement to enter contract for 30-year land use, entered into between NRCS and the landowner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reimbursement of a landowner's expenses. For completed easement conveyances, NRCS will reimburse the landowner for fair and reasonable expenses, if any, incurred for legal boundary surveys and other related costs, as authorized and determined by NRCS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Per acre basis calculations. If easement or 30-year contract payments are calculated on a per acre basis, NRCS will identify an estimated amount in its agreement to purchase and the final easement or 30-year contract payment will be made based on final determination of acreage and specified in the warranty easement deed or 30-year contract.</p>
