                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)(A)</em> unless such payment is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Received under a workmen's compensation law (as defined in  Sec. 31.3121(a)(2)-1(d)(3) for payments made on or after December 15,  2005), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Made by a third party pursuant to a contractual agreement  between the employer and third party entered into prior to December 14,  1981, but then only if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The third party's coverage for that employee's group ceases  prior to March 1, 1982,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> No third party payment is made to such employee under that  contract after February 28, 1982, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The cessation of the third party's coverage for that  employee's group indefinitely terminates the contractual relationship  between the third party and the employer as to sickness and accident  disability benefits for that employee's group.  See section 3121(a)(4) and Sec. 31.3121(a)(4)-1 for the exclusion from  the term ``wages'' of any payment on account of sickness or accident  disability made after the expiration of 6 calendar months following the  last calendar month in which the employee worked.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The application of the provisions of subparagraph (2)  of paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Company Q enters into a contract on August 31, 1981, with  Insurance Company R to provide sickness and accident disability payments  to Q's employees. The contract expires on February 28, 1982. On March 1,  1982, Q enters into a new contract with R to provide sickness and  accident disability payments to Q's employees. Payments made by R  pursuant to the contract expiring February 28, 1982, are included in  ``wages'' as defined in section 3121(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Company S enters into a contract on November 15, 1981,  with Insurance Company T to provide sickness and accident disability  payments to S's employees. The contract expires on February 15, 1982,  and is not renewed. A, one of S's employees, has been receiving sickness  payments from T since December 1, 1981. T makes its final payment to A  on February 22, 1982. The payments made by T to A pursuant to its  contract with S are not included in ``wages'' as defined in section  3121(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Workmen's compensation laws. (1) For purposes of paragraph  (a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, a payment made under a workmen's compensation  law does not include a payment made pursuant to a State temporary  disability insurance law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sickness or accident disability. For purposes of paragraph (a)  of this section, a payment made on account of sickness or accident  disability includes any payment for personal injuries or sickness  includible in gross income under section 105(a) and the regulations  thereunder and thus does not include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any amount which is expended for medical care as described in  section 105(b) and Sec. 1.105-2,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any payment which is unrelated to absence from work as described  in section 105(c) and Sec. 1.105-3, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Payments by third parties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any third party making a payment  on account of sickness or accident disability which payment is not  excluded from the term ``wages'' under paragraph (a) of this section  shall be treated as the employer with respect to such wages, except as  provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Accordingly,  such third party must withhold from such payment the tax imposed on the  employee by section 3101, pay the tax imposed on employers by section  3111, deposit such taxes pursuant to section 6302 and Sec. 31.6302(c)- 1(a), and provide the receipts required by section 6051 and  Secs. 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any third party who is treated as the employer solely by  reason of the applicability of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  promptly--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Withholds the tax imposed on the employee by section 3101,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Deposits such tax pursuant to section 6302 and Sec. 31.6302(c)- 1(a), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> of this subparagraph (2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A third party making a payment on account of sickness or  accident disability to an employee as agent for the employer or making  such a payment directly to the employer shall not be treated as the  employer under subparagraph (1) with respect to such payment unless the  agency agreement so provides. The determining factor as to whether a  third party is an agent of the employer is whether the third party bears  any insurance risk. If the third party bears no insurance risk and is  reimbursed on a cost plus fee basis, the third party is an agent of the  employer even if the third party is responsible for making  determinations of the eligibility of individual employees of the  employer for payments on account of sickness or accident disability. If  the   third party is paid an insurance premium and not reimbursed on a cost  plus fee basis, the third party is not an agent of the employer, but the  third party is treated as the employer as provided in subparagraph (1)  of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In order to avoid overpayment of taxes which would result from  paying taxes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On remuneration which exceeds the annual contribution and  benefit base (as described in section 3121(a)(1)),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to a period of time which exceeds the 6-calendar- month period described in section 3121(a)(4), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> On a payment or a portion thereof which is attributable to a  contribution by the employee,  the third party may request information from the employer as to the  total wages earned by the employee for the calendar year in which the  third party is making payments, as to the last date on which the  employee worked for the employer during such year, and as to the amount  of any contribution by the employee. Except if the third party has  reason not to believe any information supplied by the employer as the  result of a request made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the third  party may rely on such information in complying with the requirements of  subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e). The third party may not  rely on representations of the employee as to the information which may  be requested of the employer in complying with the requirements of  subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Pursuant to an agreement with Company U, Insurance  Company V makes payments on account of sickness or accident disability  to U's employees. Such payments are not made under a workmen's  compensation law. U reimburses V for all such payments and pays V a fee  for its expenses of administering the payments. V is not treated as the  employer with respect to such payments.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Pursuant to an agreement with Company W, Insurance  Company X indemnifies W for the amount of any payments which W must make  to an employee on account of sickness or accident disability. Such  payments are not made under a workmen's compensation law. X makes its  indemnity payments directly to W. W makes the payments to its employees.  X is not treated as the employer with respect to such payments.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Pursuant to an agreement with Company Y (which is not an  agency agreement described in subparagraph (3) of this Sec. 32.1(e)),  Insurance Company Z makes payments on account of sickness or accident  disability to Y's employees. Such payments are not made under a  workmen's compensation law. Z does not notify Y of the amount of such  payments. Z is treated as the employer with respect to such payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Penalties and interest on payments made from January 1, 1982, to  June 30 1982. No penalty under section 6656(a) or interest under section  6601 will be assessed for the failure to make timely payments to the tax  imposed by section 3101 or section 3111 on payments made on account of  sickness or accident disability, which payments of tax are made after  December 31, 1981, and before July 1, 1982, to the extent that the  failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Special rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of subdivision (iii) of  paragraph (e)(2), the last employer for whom the employee worked prior  to becoming sick or disabled or for whom the employee was working at the  time he became sick or disabled shall be deemed to be the employer for  whom services are normally rendered, provided that such employer made  contributions on behalf of such employee to the plan or system under  which the employee is being paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application of the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. B is employed by Company M. B becomes sick and is absent  from work for 3 months. While B is absent from work, he receives sick  pay from Insurance Company N pursuant to a plan established by M and to  which M has made contributions on behalf of B. M is the employer for  whom services are normally rendered by B.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. C is employed by Company O and is also employed on a  part-time basis by Company Q. C becomes sick while at work at Q's place  of business. C is absent from work for 3 months. While C is absent from  work he receives sick pay from Insurance Company P pursuant to a plan  established by O and to which O has made contributions on behalf of C. O  is the employer for whom services are normally rendered by C.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. D is a member of a labor union whose members receive  health and welfare benefit payments from a trust fund which is supported  by the contributions of the various employers who employ the labor  union's members. D has been employed by Company R for 4 days when he  becomes sick and is absent from work for 3 months. While D is absent  form work he receives sick pay from his union's trust fund to which R  has made contributions on D's behalf. R is the employer for whom  services are normally rendered by D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, in the case of  payments on account of sickness or accident disability made to employees  by a third party insurer pursuant to a contract of insurance with a  multiemployer plan which is obligated to make payments on account of  sickness or accident disability to such employees pursuant to a  collectively bargained agreement, if the third party insurer making the  payments complies with the requirements of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of  subparagraph (2) of paragraph (e) and notifies the plan of the amount of  wages paid on which tax was withheld and deposited within the time  required for notification of the employer under subparagraph (2) of  paragraph (e), then the plan (and not the third party insurer) shall be  required to pay the tax imposed by section 3111 and to comply with the  requirements of section 6051 and Secs. 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with  respect to such payments unless, within 6 business days of the receipt  of such notification, the plan notifies the employer for whom services  are normally rendered of the amount of the wages on which tax was  withheld and deposited. If the plan provides such notice to the  employer, the employer (and not the plan) shall be required to pay the  tax imposed by section 3111 and to comply with the requirements of  section 6051 and Secs. 31.6051-1 and 31.6051-2 with respect to the  wages.  [T.D. 7823, 47 FR 29225, July 6, 1982, as amended by T.D. 7867, 48 FR  793, Jan. 7, 1983; T.D. 9233, 70 FR 74199, Dec. 15, 2005]</p>
