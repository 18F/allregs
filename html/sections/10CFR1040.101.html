Selection for review is to be made on the basis of the following criteria, among others:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The relative disparity between the percentage of minorities, women, or handicapped persons, in the relevant labor market, and the percentage of minorities, women, or handicapped persons, employed by the recipient if employment practices are covered by this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The percentage of individuals covered by the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, minorities, women and handicapped persons in the population receiving program benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number and nature of discrimination complaints filed against a recipient with DOE or other Federal agencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The scope of the problems revealed by an investigation commenced on the basis of a complaint filed with DOE against a recipient; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amount of assistance provided to the recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After selection of a recipient for review, the Director Federally Assisted Programs Division or the Director's designee, shall inform the recipient of the selection.

The determination is to be made no later than 60 days after the recipient has been notified of the preliminary findings. If the Director makes a determination of noncompliance, the Department shall institute actions specified in subparts G and H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where the Director makes a formal determination of noncompliance, the recipient and the Assistant Attorney General shall be immediately advised, in writing, of the determination and of the fact that the recipient has an additional 10 days in which to come into voluntary compliance. If voluntary compliance has not been achieved within the 10 days, the Director shall institute proceedings under subpart H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by the Director and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient.</p>
