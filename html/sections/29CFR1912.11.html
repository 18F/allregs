                            <p class="depth0">Each member of an ad hoc advisory committee shall serve for such  period as the Assistant Secretary may prescribe in his notice of  appointment. Appointment of a member to the Committee for a fixed time  period shall not affect the authority of the Secretary to remove, in his  or her discretion, any member at any time. If a member resigns or is  removed before his or her term expires, the Secretary of Labor may  appoint a new member to serve for the remaining portion of the period  prescribed in the notice appointing the original member of the  committee.
