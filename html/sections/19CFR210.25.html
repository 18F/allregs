A motion alleging abuse of process should be filed promptly after the requirements of Sec.  210.4(d)(1)(i) have been satisfied.

(See also Sec. Sec.  210.4(d)(1)(ii), 210.27(d)(3), 210.33(c), and 210.34(c).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A motion for sanctions shall be addressed to the presiding administrative law judge, if the allegedly sanctionable conduct occurred and is discovered while the administrative law judge is presiding in an investigation or in a related proceeding. During an investigation, the administrative law judge's ruling on the motion shall be in the form of an order, if it is issued before or concurrently with the initial determination concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or termination of the investigation. In a related proceeding, the administrative law judge's ruling shall be in the form of an order, regardless of the point in time at which the order is issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A motion for sanctions shall be addressed to the Commission, if the allegedly sanctionable conduct occurred while the Commission is presiding or is filed after the subject investigation or

related proceeding is terminated. The Commission may assign the motion to an administrative law judge for issuance of a recommended determination.

If the order is issued concurrently with the initial determination, the order may be appealed by filing a petition meeting the requirements of Sec.  210.43(b). The periods for filing such petitions and responding to the petitions will be specified in the Commission notice issued pursuant to Sec.  210.42(i), if the initial determination has granted a motion for termination of the investigation, or in the Commission notice issued pursuant to Sec.  210.46(a), if the initial determination concerns violation of section 337. The Commission will determine whether to adopt the order after disposition of the initial determination concerning violation of section 337 or termination of the investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the administrative law judge's ruling on the motion for sanctions is in the form of a recommended determination pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the deadlines and procedures for parties to contest the recommended determination will be set forth in the Commission order assigning the motion to an administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a motion for sanctions is filed with the administrative law judge during an investigation, he may defer his adjudication of the motion until after he has issued a final initial determination concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or termination of investigation. If the administrative law judge defers his adjudication in such a manner, his ruling on the motion for sanctions must be in the form of a recommended determination and shall be issued no later than 30 days after issuance of the Commission's final determination on violation of section 337 or termination of the investigation. To aid the Commission in determining whether to adopt a recommended determination, any party may file written comments with the Commission 14 days after service of the recommended determination. Replies to such comments may be filed within seven days after service of the comments. The Commission will determine whether to adopt the recommended determination after reviewing the parties' arguments and taking any other steps the Commission deems appropriate.
