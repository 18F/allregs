For further guidance, see Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(2)(i) and (ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Documentary evidence--(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B), documentary evidence, such as receipts, paid bills, or similar evidence sufficient to support an expenditure, is required for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any expenditure for lodging while traveling away from home, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any other expenditure of $75 or more except, for transportation charges, documentary evidence will not be required if not readily available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Commissioner, in his or her discretion, may prescribe rules waiving the documentary evidence requirements in circumstances where it is impracticable for such documentary evidence to be required. Ordinarily, documentary evidence will be considered adequate to support an expenditure if it includes sufficient information to establish the amount, date, place, and the essential character of the expenditure. For example, a hotel receipt is sufficient to support expenditures for business travel if it contains the following: name, location, date, and separate amounts for charges such as for lodging, meals, and telephone. Similarly, a restaurant receipt is sufficient to support an expenditure for a business meal if it contains the following: name and location of the restaurant, the date and amount of the expenditure, the number of people served, and, if a charge is made for an item other than meals and beverages, an indication that such is the case. A document may be indicative of only one (or part of one) element of an expenditure. Thus, a cancelled check, together with a bill from the payee, ordinarily would establish the element of cost. In contrast, a cancelled check drawn payable to a named payee would not by itself support a business expenditure without other evidence showing that the check was used for a certain business purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)-(v)</em> [Reserved].

For purposes of this paragraph (f) an adequate accounting means the submission to the employer of an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record maintained by the employee in which the information as to each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure or use, together with supporting documentary evidence, in a manner that conforms to all the adequate records requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An adequate accounting requires that the employee account for all amounts received from the employer during the taxable year as advances, reimbursements, or allowances (including those charged directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or otherwise) for travel, entertainment, gifts, and the use of listed property. The methods of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section also will be considered to be an adequate accounting if the employer accepts an employee's substantiation and establishes that such substantiation meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5). For purposes of an adequate accounting, the method of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not be permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, prescribe rules under which an employee may make an adequate accounting to an employer by submitting an account book, log, diary, etc., alone, without submitting documentary evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employer. For purposes of this section, the term employer includes an agent of the employer or a third party payor who pays amounts to an employee under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.274-5T(f)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Substantiation by reimbursement arrangements or per diem, mileage, and other traveling allowances--(1) In general. The Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, prescribe rules in pronouncements of general applicability under which allowances for expenses described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will, if in accordance with reasonable business practice, be regarded as equivalent to substantiation by adequate records or other sufficient evidence, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, of the amount of the expenses and as satisfying, with respect to the amount of the expenses, the requirements of an adequate accounting to the employer for purposes of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If the total allowance received exceeds the deductible expenses paid or incurred by the employee, such excess must be reported as income on the employee's return.

The Commissioner may establish a method under which a taxpayer may use a specified amount or amounts for

meals while traveling away from home in lieu of substantiating the actual cost of meals. The taxpayer will not be relieved of the requirement to substantiate the actual cost of other travel expenses as well as the time, place, and business purpose of the travel.

See paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of mileage rates for vehicle expenses. The Commissioner may establish a method under which a taxpayer may use mileage rates to determine the amount of the ordinary and necessary expenses of using a vehicle for local transportation and transportation to, from, and at the destination while traveling away from home in lieu of substantiating the actual costs. The method may include appropriate limitations and conditions in order to reflect more accurately vehicle expenses over the entire period of usage. The taxpayer will not be relieved of the requirement to substantiate the amount of each business use (i.e., the business mileage), or the time and business purpose of each use. See paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Incidental expenses while traveling away from home.

For purposes of section 274(d) and this section, the term qualified nonpersonal use vehicle means any vehicle which, by reason of its nature (that is, design), is not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> List of vehicles. Vehicles which are qualified nonpersonal use vehicles include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Clearly marked police, fire, and public safety officer vehicles (as defined and to the extent provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ambulances used as such or hearses used as such.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any vehicle designed to carry cargo with a loaded gross vehicle weight over 14,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Bucket trucks (cherry pickers).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Cement mixers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Combines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Cranes and derricks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Delivery trucks with seating only for the driver, or only for the driver plus a folding jump seat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Dump trucks (including garbage trucks).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> Flatbed trucks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> Forklifts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> Passenger buses used as such with a capacity of at least 20 passengers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Qualified moving vans (as defined in paragraph (k)(4) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> Qualified specialized utility repair trucks (as defined in paragraph (k)(5) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> Refrigerated trucks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> School buses (as defined in section 4221(d)(7)(c)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Q)</em> Tractors and other special purpose farm vehicles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(R)</em> Unmarked vehicles used by law enforcement officers (as defined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section) if the use is officially authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(S)</em> Such other vehicles as the Commissioner may designate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Clearly marked police, fire, or public safety officer vehicles. A police, fire, or public safety officer vehicle is a vehicle, owned or leased by a governmental unit, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, that is required to be used for commuting by a police officer, fire fighter, or public safety officer (as defined in section 402(l)(4)(C) of this chapter) who, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times, provided that any personal use (other than commuting) of the vehicle outside the limit of the police officer's arrest powers or the fire fighter's or public safety officer's obligation to respond to an emergency is prohibited by such governmental unit. A police, fire, or public safety officer vehicle is clearly marked if, through painted insignia or words, it is readily apparent that the vehicle is a police,

fire, or public safety officer vehicle. A marking on a license plate is not a clear marking for purposes of this paragraph (k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualified moving van. The term qualified moving van means any truck or van used by a professional moving company in the trade or business of moving household or business goods if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No personal use of the van is allowed other than for travel to and from a move site (or for de minimis personal use, such as a stop for lunch on the way between two move sites);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Personal use for travel to and from a move site is an irregular practice (that is, not more than five times a month on average); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Personal use is limited to situations in which it is more convenient to the employer, because of the location of the employee's residence in relation to the location of the move site, for the van not to be returned to the employer's business location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Qualified specialized utility repair truck. The term qualified specialized utility repair truck means any truck (not including a van or pickup truck) specifically designed and used to carry heavy tools, testing equipment, or parts if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The shelves, racks, or other permanent interior construction which has been installed to carry and store such heavy items is such that it is unlikely that the truck will be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer requires the employee to drive the truck home in order to be able to respond in emergency situations for purposes of restoring or maintaining electricity, gas, telephone, water, sewer, or steam utility services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Unmarked law enforcement vehicles--(i) In general. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section do not apply to officially authorized uses of an unmarked vehicle by a ``law enforcement officer''. To qualify for this exception, any personal use must be authorized by the Federal, State, county, or local governmental agency or department that owns or leases the vehicle and employs the officer, and must be incident to law-enforcement functions, such as being able to report directly from home to a stakeout or surveillance site, or to an emergency situation. Use of an unmarked vehicle for vacation or recreation trips cannot qualify as an authorized use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section do not apply to officially authorized uses of an unmarked vehicle by a ``law enforcement officer''. To qualify for this exception, any personal use must be authorized by the Federal, State, county, or local governmental agency or department that owns or leases the vehicle and employs the officer, and must be incident to law-enforcement functions, such as being able to report directly from home to a stakeout or surveillance site, or to an emergency situation. Use of an unmarked vehicle for vacation or recreation trips cannot qualify as an authorized use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Law enforcement officer. The term law enforcement officer means an individual who is employed on a full-time basis by a governmental unit that is responsible for the prevention or investigation of crime involving injury to persons or property (including apprehension or detention of persons for such crimes), who is authorized by law to carry firearms, execute search warrants, and to make arrests (other than merely a citizen's arrest), and who regularly carries firearms (except when it is not possible to do so because of the requirements of undercover work). The term ``law enforcement officer'' may include an arson investigator if the investigator otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph (k)(6)(ii), but does not include Internal Revenue Service special agents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Trucks and vans. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section apply generally to any pickup truck or van, unless the truck or van has been specially modified with the result that it is not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes. For example, a van that has only a front bench for seating, in which permanent shelving that fills most of the cargo area has been installed, that constantly carries merchandise or equipment, and that has been specially painted with advertising or the company's name, is a vehicle not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (k)(3) and (6) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Detective C, who is a ``law enforcement officer'' employed by a state police department, headquartered in City M, is provided with an unmarked vehicle (equipped with radio communication) for use during off-duty hours because C must be able to communicate with headquarters and be available for duty at any time (for example, to report to a surveillance or crime site). The police department generally has officially authorized personal use of the vehicle

by C but has prohibited use of the vehicle for recreational purposes or for personal purposes outside the state. Thus, C's use of the vehicle for commuting between headquarters or a surveillance site and home and for personal errands is authorized personal use as described in paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section. With respect to these authorized uses the vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the value of these uses is not included in C's gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Detective T is a ``law enforcement officer'' employed by City M. T is authorized to make arrests only within M's city limits. T, along with all other officers of the force, is ordinarily on duty for eight hours each work day and on call during the other sixteen hours. T is provided with the use of a clearly marked police vehicle in which T is required to commute to his home in City M. The police department's official policy regarding marked police vehicles prohibits its personal use (other than commuting) of the vehicles outside the city limits. When not using the vehicle on the job, T uses the vehicle only for commuting, personal errands on the way between work and home, and personal errands within City M. All use of the vehicle by T conforms to the requirements of paragraph (k)(3) of this section. Therefore, the value of that use is excluded from T's gross income as a working condition fringe and the vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Director C is employed by City M as the director of the City's rescue squad and is provided with a vehicle for use in responding to emergencies. Director C is trained in rescue activity and has the legal authority and legal responsibility to engage in rescue activity. The city's rescue squad is not a part of City M's police or fire departments. The director's vehicle is a sedan which is painted with insignia and words identifying the vehicle as being owned by the City's rescue squad. C, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times. The City's official policy regarding clearly marked public safety officer vehicles prohibits personal use (other than for commuting) of the vehicle outside of the limits of the public safety officer's obligation to respond to an emergency. When not using the vehicle to respond to emergencies, City M authorizes C to use the vehicle only for commuting, personal errands on the way between work and home, and personal errands within the limits of C's obligation to respond to emergencies. With respect to these authorized uses, the vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the value of these uses is not includable in C's gross income.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Coroner D is employed by County N to investigate and determine the cause, time, and manner of certain deaths occurring in the County. Coroner D also safeguards the property of the deceased, notifies the next of kin, conducts inquests, and arranges for the burial of indigent persons. D is provided with a vehicle for use by County N. The vehicle is to be used in County N business and for commuting. Personal use other than for commuting purposes is forbidden. D is trained in rescue activity but has no legal authority or legal responsibility to engage in rescue activity. D's vehicle is a sedan which is painted with insignia and words identifying it as a County N vehicle. D, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times. D does not satisfy the criteria of a public safety officer under 28 CFR 32.3 (2008). Thus, D's vehicle cannot qualify as a clearly marked public safety officer vehicle. Accordingly, business use of the vehicle is subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d), and the value of any personal use of the vehicle, such as commuting, is includable in D's gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Definitions. For purposes of section 274(d) and this section, the terms automobile and vehicle have the same meanings as prescribed in Sec. 1.61-21(d)(1)(ii) and (e)(2), respectively. Also, for purposes of section 274(d) and this section, the terms employer, employee and personal use have the same meanings as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-6T(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Effective date. This section applies to expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1997. However, paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to expenses paid or incurred after September 30, 2002, and paragraph (k) applies to clearly marked public safety officer vehicles, as defined in Sec. 1.274-5(k)(3), only with respect to uses occurring after May 19, 2010.

Sec. 1.274-5T  Substantiation requirements (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1986, no deduction or credit shall be allowed with respect to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Traveling away from home (including meals and lodging),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or with respect to a facility used

in connection with such an activity, including the items specified in section 274(e),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gifts defined in section 274(b), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4) and Sec. 1.280F-6T(b)), unless the taxpayer substantiates each element of the expenditure or use (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation supersedes the doctrine found in Cohan v. Commissioner, 39 F. 2d 540 (2d Cir. 1930). The decision held that, where the evidence indicated a taxpayer incurred deductible travel or entertainment expenses but the exact amount could not be determined, the court should make a close approximation and not disallow the deduction entirely. Section 274(d) contemplates that no deduction or credit shall be allowed a taxpayer on the basis of such approximations or unsupported testimony of the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the term entertainment means entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and use of a facility therefor; and the term expenditure includes expenses and items (including items such as losses and depreciation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Elements of an expenditure or use--(1) In general. Section 274(d) and this section contemplate that no deduction or credit shall be allowed for travel, entertainment, a gift, or with respect to listed property unless the taxpayer substantiates the requisite elements of each expenditure or use as set forth in this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

Amount of each separate expenditure for traveling away from home, such as cost of transportation or lodging, except that the daily cost of the traveler's own breakfast, lunch, and dinner and of expenditures incidental to such travel may be aggregated, if set forth in reasonable categories, such as for meals, for gasoline and oil, and for taxi fares;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time. Dates of departure and return for each trip away from home, and number of days away from home spent on business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Place.

Date and duration of business discussion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Place. Place of business discussion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Business purpose. Nature of business discussion, and business reason for the entertainment or nature of business benefit derived or expected to be derived as the result of the entertainment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Business relationship.

The amount of each business/investment use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T (d)(3) and (e)), based on the appropriate measure (i.e., mileage for automobiles and other means of transportation and time for other listed property, unless the Commissioner approves an alternative method), and the total use of the listed property for the taxable period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time.

The business purpose for an expenditure or use with respect to any listed property (see Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(6)(i) (B) and (C) for special rules for the aggregation of expenditures and business use and Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2) for the distinction between qualified business use and business/investment use).
See also Sec. 1.274-5T(e) relating to the substantiation of business use of employer-provided listed property and Sec. 1.274-6T for special rules for substantiating the business/investment use of certain types of listed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rules of substantiation--(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section and Sec. 1.274-6T, a taxpayer must substantiate each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating his own statement. Section 274(d) contemplates that a taxpayer will maintain and produce such substantiation as will constitute proof of each expenditure or use referred to in section 274. Written evidence has considerably more probative value than oral evidence alone. In addition, the probative value of written evidence is greater the closer in time it relates to the expenditure or use. A contemporaneous log is not required, but a record of the elements of an expenditure or of a business use of listed property made at or near the time of the expenditure or use, supported by sufficient documentary evidence, has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. Thus, the corroborative evidence required to support a statement not make at or near the time of the expenditure or use must have a high degree of probative value to elevate such statement and evidence to the level of credibility reflected by a record made at or near the time of the expenditure or use supported by sufficient documentary evidence. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) are designed to encourage taxpayers to maintain the records, together with documentary evidence, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section and Sec. 1.274-6T, a taxpayer must substantiate each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating his own statement. Section 274(d) contemplates that a taxpayer will maintain and produce such substantiation as will constitute proof of each expenditure or use referred to in section 274. Written evidence has considerably more probative value than oral evidence alone. In addition, the probative value of written evidence is greater the closer in time it relates to the expenditure or use. A contemporaneous log is not required, but a record of the elements of an expenditure or of a business use of listed property made at or near the time of the expenditure or use, supported by sufficient documentary evidence, has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. Thus, the corroborative evidence required to support a statement not make at or near the time of the expenditure or use must have a high degree of probative value to elevate such statement and evidence to the level of credibility reflected by a record made at or near the time of the expenditure or use supported by sufficient documentary evidence. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) are designed to encourage taxpayers to maintain the records, together with documentary evidence, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Substantiation by adequate records--(i) In general. To meet the ``adequate records'' requirements of section 274(d), a taxpayer shall maintain an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheets, or similar record (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), and documentary evidence (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) which, in combination, are sufficient to establish each element of an expenditure or use specified in paragraph (b) of this section. It is not necessary to record information in an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet,

or similar record which duplicates information reflected on a receipt so long as the account book, etc. and receipt complement each other in an orderly manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. To meet the ``adequate records'' requirements of section 274(d), a taxpayer shall maintain an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheets, or similar record (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), and documentary evidence (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) which, in combination, are sufficient to establish each element of an expenditure or use specified in paragraph (b) of this section. It is not necessary to record information in an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet,

or similar record which duplicates information reflected on a receipt so long as the account book, etc. and receipt complement each other in an orderly manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Account book, diary, etc. An account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record must be prepared or maintained in such manner that each recording of an element of an expenditure or use is made at or near the time of the expenditure or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Made at or near the time of the expenditure or use. For purposes of this section, the phrase made at or near the time of the expenditure or use means the element of an expenditure or use are recorded at a time when, in relation to the use or making of an expenditure, the taxpayer has full present knowledge of each element of the expenditure or use, such as the amount, time, place, and business purpose of the expenditure and business relationship. An expense account statement which is a transcription of an account book, diary, log, or similar record prepared or maintained in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) shall be considered a record prepared or maintained in the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence if such expense account statement is submitted by an employee to his employer or by an independent contractor to his client or customer in the regular course of good business practice. For example, a log maintained on a weekly basis, which accounts for use during the week, shall be considered a record made at or near the time of such use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Substantiation of business purpose. In order to constitute an adequate record of business purpose within the meaning of section 274(d) and this paragraph (c)(2), a written statement of business purpose generally is required. However, the degree of substantiation necessary to establish business purpose will vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Where the business purpose is evident from the surrounding facts and circumstances, a written explanation of such business purpose will not be required. For example, in the case of a salesman calling on customers on an established sales route, a written explanation of the business purpose of such travel ordinarily will not be required. Similarly, in the case of a business meal described in section 274(e)(1), if the business purpose of such meal is evident from the business relationship to the taxpayer of the persons entertained and other surrounding circumstances, a written explanation of such business purpose will not be required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Substantiation of business use of listed property--(1) Degree of substantiation. In order to constitute an adequate record (within the meaning of section 274(d) and this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)), which substantiates business/investment use of listed property (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)), the record must contain sufficient information as to each element of every business/investment use. However, the level of detail required in an adequate record to substantiate business/investment use may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, a taxpayer who uses a truck for both business and personal purposes and whose only business use of a truck is to make deliveries to customers on an established route may satisfy the adequate record requirement by recording the total number miles driven during the taxable year, the length of the delivery route once, and the date of each trip at or near the time of the trips. Alternatively, the taxpayer may establish the date of each trip with a receipt, record of delivery, or other documentary evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Written record. Generally, an adequate record must be written. However, a record of the business use of listed property, such as a computer or automobile, prepared in a computer memory device with the aid of a logging program will constitute an adequate record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Confidential information. If any information relating to the elements of an expenditure or use, such as place, business purpose, or business relationship, is of a confidential nature, such information need not be set forth in the account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar

record, provided such information is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure or use and is elsewhere available to the district director to substantiate such element of the expenditure or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.274-5(c)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Retention of written evidence. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which an employer may dispose of the adequate records and documentary evidence submitted to him by employees who are required to, and do, make an adequate accounting to the employer (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) if the employer maintains adequate accounting procedures with respect to such employees (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Substantial compliance. If a taxpayer has not fully substantiated a particular element of an expenditure or use, but the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the ``adequate records'' requirements of this paragraph (c)(2) with respect to the expenditure or use, the taxpayer may be permitted to establish such element by evidence which the district director shall deem adequate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Substantiation by other sufficient evidence--(i) In general. If a taxpayer fails to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the ``adequate records'' requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to an element of an expenditure or use, then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the taxpayer must establish such element--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a taxpayer fails to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the ``adequate records'' requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to an element of an expenditure or use, then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the taxpayer must establish such element--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> By his own statement, whether written or oral, containing specific information in detail as to such element; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By other corrobative evidence sufficient to establish such element.
If such element is the description of a gift, or the cost or amount, time, place, or date of an expenditure or use, the corrobative evidence shall be direct evidence, such as a statement in writing or the oral testimony of persons entertained or other witnesses setting forth detailed information about such element, or the documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If such element is either the business relationship to the taxpayer of persons entertained, or the business purpose of an expenditure, the corrobative evidence may be circumstantial evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sampling--(A) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer may maintain an adequate record for portions of a taxable year and use that record to substantiate the business/investment use of listed property for all or a portion of the taxable year if the taxpayer can demonstrate by other evidence that the periods for which an adequate record is maintained are representative of the use for the taxable year or a portion thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer may maintain an adequate record for portions of a taxable year and use that record to substantiate the business/investment use of listed property for all or a portion of the taxable year if the taxpayer can demonstrate by other evidence that the periods for which an adequate record is maintained are representative of the use for the taxable year or a portion thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception for pooled vehicles. The sampling method of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section may not be used to substantiate the business/investment use of an automobile or other vehicle of an employer that is made available for use by more than one employee for all or a portion of a taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, a sole proprietor and calendar year taxpayer, operates an interior decorating business out of her home. A uses an automobile for local business travel to visit the homes or offices of clients, to meet with suppliers and other subcontractors, and to pick up and deliver certain items to clients when feasible. There is no other business use of the automobile but A and other members of her family also use the automobile for personal purposes. A maintains adequate records for the first three months of 1986 that indicate that 75 percent of the use of the automobile was in A's business. Invoices from subcontractors and paid bills indicate that A's business continued at approximately the same rate for the remainder of 1986. If other circumstances do not change (e.g., A does not obtain a second car for exclusive use in her business), the determination that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year is 75 percent is based on sufficient corroborative evidence.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A maintains adequate records during the first week of every month, which indicate that 75 percent of the use of the automobile is in A's business. The invoices from A's business indicate that A's business continued at the same rate during

the subsequent weeks of each month so that A's weekly records are representative of each month's business use of the automobile. Thus, the determination that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year is 75 percent is based on sufficient corroborative evidence.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. B, a sole proprietor and calendar year taxpayer, is a salesman in a large metropolitan area for a company that manufactures household products. For the first three weeks of each month, B uses his own automobile occasionally to travel within the metropolitan area on business. During these three weeks, B's use of the automobile for business purposes does not follow a consistent pattern from day to day or week to week. During the fourth week of each month, B delivers to his customers all the orders taken during the previous month. B's use of his automobile for business purposes, as substantiated by adequate records, is 70 percent of the total use during that fourth week. In this example, a determination based on the records maintained during that fourth week that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year is 70 percent is not based on sufficient corroborative evidence because use during this week is not representative of use during other periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules. See Sec. 1.274-6T for special rules for substantiation by sufficient corroborating evidence with respect to certain listed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Substantiation in exceptional circumstances. If a taxpayer establishes that, by reason of the inherent nature of the situation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> He was unable to obtain evidence with respect to an element of the expenditure or use which conforms fully to the ``adequate records'' requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> He is unable to obtain evidence with respect to such element which conforms fully to the ``other sufficient evidence'' requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> He has presented other evidence, with respect to such element, which possesses the highest degree of probative value possible under the circumstances, such other evidence shall be considered to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Loss of records due to circumstances beyond control of the taxpayer. Where the taxpayer establishes that the failure to produce adequate records is due to the loss of such records through circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, such as destruction by fire, flood, earthquake, or other casualty, the taxpayer shall have a right to substantiate a deduction by reasonable reconstruction of his expenditures or use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rules--(i) Separate expenditure or use--(A) In general. For the purposes of this section, each separate payment or use by the taxpayer shall ordinarily be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. However, concurrent or repetitious expenses or uses may be substantiated as a single item. To illustrate the above rules, where a taxpayer entertains a business guest at dinner and thereafter at the theater, the payment for dinner shall be considered to constitute one expenditure and the payment for the tickets for the theater shall be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. Similarly, if during a day of business travel a taxpayer makes separate payments for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he shall be considered to have made three separate expenditures. However, if during entertainment at a cocktail lounge the taxpayer pays separately for each serving of refreshments, the total amount expended for the refreshments will be treated as a single expenditure. A tip may be treated as a separate expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Separate expenditure or use--(A) In general.

A tip may be treated as a separate expenditure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Aggregation of expenditures. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be maintained with respect to each separate expenditure and not with respect to aggregate amounts for two or more expenditures. Thus, each expenditure for such items as lodging and air or rail travel shall be recorded as a separate item and not aggregated. However, at the option of the taxpayer, amounts expended for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, may be aggregated. A tip or gratuity which is related to an underlying expense may be aggregated with such expense. In addition, amounts expended in connection with the use of listed property during a taxable year, such as for gasoline or repairs for an automobile, may be aggregated. If these expenses are aggregated, the taxpayer must establish the date and amount,

but need not prove the business purpose of each expenditure. Instead, the taxpayer may prorate the expenses based on the total business use of the listed property. For other provisions permitting recording of aggregate amounts in an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record, see paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3) of this section (relating to incidental costs of travel and entertainment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Aggregation of business use. Uses which may be considered part of a single use, for example, a round trip or uninterrupted business use, may be accounted for by a single record. For example, use of a truck to make deliveries at several different locations which begins and ends at the business premises and which may include a stop at the business premises in between two deliveries may be accounted for by a single record of miles driven. In addition, use of a passenger automobile by a salesman for a business trip away from home over a period of time may be accounted for by a single record of miles traveled. De minimis personal use (such as a stop for lunch on the way between two business stops) is not an interruption of business use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of expenditure. For purposes of this section, if a taxpayer has established the amount of an expenditure, but is unable to establish the portion of such amount which is attributable to each person participating in the event giving rise to the expenditure, such amount shall ordinarily be allocated to each participant on a pro rata basis, if such determination is material. Accordingly, the total number of persons for whom a travel or entertainment expenditure is incurred must be established in order to compute the portion of the expenditure allocable to such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Primary use of a facility. Section 274(a) (1)(B) and (2)(C) deny a deduction for any expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred before January 1, 1994, with respect to a club, used in connection with an entertainment activity unless the taxpayer establishes that the facility (including a club) was used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business. A determination whether a facility before January 1, 1979, or a club before January 1, 1994, was used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In order to establish that a facility was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business, the taxpayer shall maintain records of the use of the facility, the cost of using the facility, mileage or its equivalent (if appropriate), and such other information as shall tend to establish such primary use. Such records of use shall contain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each use of the facility claimed to be in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business, the elements of an expenditure specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For each use of the facility not in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business, an appropriate description of such use, including cost, date, number of persons entertained, nature of entertainment and, if applicable, information such as mileage or its equivalent. A notation such as ``personal use'' or ``family use'' would, in the case of such use, be sufficient to describe the nature of entertainment.
If a taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records concerning a facility which is likely to serve the personal purposes of the taxpayer, it shall be presumed that the use of such facility was primarily personal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional information. In a case where it is necessary to obtain additional information, either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To clarify information contained in records, statements, testimony, or documentary evidence submitted by a taxpayer under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To establish the reliability or accuracy of such records, statements, testimony, or documentary evidence, the district director may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, obtain such additional information by personal interview or otherwise as he determines necessary to implement properly the provisions of section 274 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Specific exceptions. Except as otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner,

substantiation otherwise required by this paragraph is not required for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Expenses described in section 274(e)(2) relating to food and beverages for employees, section 274(e)(3) relating to expenses treated as compensation, section 274(e)(8) relating to items available to the public, and section 274(e)(9) relating to entertainment sold to customers, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Expenses described in section 274(e)(5) relating to recreational, etc., expenses for employees, except that a taxpayer shall keep such records or other evidence as shall establish that such expenses were for activities (or facilities used in connection therewith) primarily for the benefit of employees other than employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners (as defined in section 274(e)(5)), or highly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure on returns--(1) In general. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which any taxpayer claiming a deduction or credit for entertainment, gifts, travel, or with respect to listed property, or any other person receiving advances, reimbursements, or allowances for such items, shall make disclosure on his tax return with respect to such items. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The information required on the tax return relates to mileage (total, business, commuting, and other personal mileage), percentage of business use, date placed in service, use of other vehicles, after-work use, whether the taxpayer has evidence to support the business use claimed on the return, and whether or not the evidence is written.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, taxpayers that claim a deduction or credit with respect to any vehicle are required to answer certain questions providing information about the use of the vehicle.

On returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, taxpayers that claim a deduction or credit with respect to any listed property other than a vehicle (for example, a yacht, airplane, or certain computers) are required to provide the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date that the property was placed in service,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage of business use,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether evidence is available to support the percentage of business use claimed on the return, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the evidence is written.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Substantiation of the business use of listed property made available by an employer for use by an employee--(1) Employee--(i) In general.

The employer must retain a copy of the adequate records maintained by the employee or the other sufficient evidence, if available.

For example, an employer should require that an expense account be verified and approved by a reasonable person other than the person incurring such expenses. Accounting procedures will be considered inadequate to the extent that the employer does not require an adequate accounting from his employees as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, or does not maintain such substantiation.
