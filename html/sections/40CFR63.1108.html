                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirements. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (5) of this section apply to all affected sources except acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. The requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply only to acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. The requirements of paragraphs (a)(3), (6), and (7) of this section apply to all affected sources.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. However, if a startup, shutdown, malfunction or period of non-operation of one portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart and any of the subparts that are referenced by this subpart during startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If equipment leak requirements are referenced by this subpart for a subject source category, such requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, process unit shutdown (as defined in Sec.  63.1101), or non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For batch unit operations, shutdown does not include the normal periods between batch cycles; and startup does not include the recharging of batch unit operations, or the transitional conditions due to changes in product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. Equipment leak requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, the emission limitations and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. Equipment leak requirements shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the equipment leak requirements apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General duty. At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results,

review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission standards of this subpart and the subparts referenced by this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (if applicable), and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if available. Compliance with an inadequate startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan developed pursuant to Sec.  63.1111 is not a shield for failing to comply with good operation and maintenance requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practical after their occurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable, independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Compliance assessment procedures--(1) Parameter monitoring: compliance with operating conditions. Compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices may be determined by, but is not limited to, the parameter monitoring data for emission points that are required to perform continuous monitoring. For each excursion, except as provided for in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An excursion that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not a violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Excused excursions are not allowed for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources or polycarbonate production affected sources. For all other affected sources, an excused excursion, as described in Sec.  63.998(b)(6)(ii), is not a violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parameter monitoring: Excursions. An excursion is not a violation in cases where continuous monitoring is required and the excursion does not count toward the number of excused excursions (as described in Sec.  63.998(b)(6)(ii)), if the conditions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are met, except that the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section do not apply for acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with Sec.  63.1111(a)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During periods of non-operation of the affected source or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operation and maintenance procedures. Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator. This information may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan under Sec.  63.1111), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source, and alternatives approved as specified in Sec.  63.1113.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicability and compliance assessment procedures. Applicability and compliance with standards shall be governed by, in part, but not limited to, the use of data, tests, and requirements according to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. Compliance with design, equipment, work practice, and operating standards, including those for equipment leaks, shall be determined according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Applicability assessments. Unless otherwise specified in a relevant test method required to assess control applicability, each test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in this subpart. The arithmetic mean of the results of the three runs shall apply when assessing applicability. Upon receiving approval from the Administrator, results of a test run may be replaced with results of an additional test run if it meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A sample is accidentally lost after the testing team leaves the site; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Extreme meteorological conditions occur;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other circumstances occur that are beyond the owner or operator's control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Performance test. (A) The Administrator may determine compliance with emission limitations of this subpart based on, but not limited to, the results of performance tests conducted according to the procedures specified in Sec.  63.997, unless otherwise specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources and polycarbonate production affected sources, performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Operation and maintenance requirements. The Administrator may determine compliance with the operation and maintenance standards of this subpart by, but not limited to, evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in this subpart or a subpart referenced by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards. The Administrator may determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational requirements by, but is not limited to, review of records, inspection of the affected source, and by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements as specified in this subpart, and in the subparts referenced by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Finding of compliance. The Administrator may make a finding concerning an affected source's compliance with an emission standard or operating and maintenance requirement as specified in, but not limited to, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, upon obtaining all of the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable) and any information available to the Administrator to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used. Standards in this subpart and methods of determining compliance are in metric units followed by the equivalents in English units. The Administrator will make findings of compliance with the numerical standards of this subpart using metric units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compliance time. All terms that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually), unless specified otherwise in the section or subsection that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding time periods specified for completion of required tasks, time periods may be changed by

mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in Sec.  63.1110(h). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In all instances where a provision requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.
