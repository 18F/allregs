                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the process for obtaining the EIAPP  certificate required by Sec.  1043.40.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must send the Designated Certification Officer a separate  application for an EIAPP certificate for each engine family. An EIAPP  certificate is valid starting with the indicated effective date and is  valid for any production until such time as the design of the engine  family changes or more stringent emission standards become applicable,  whichever comes first. You may obtain preliminary approval of portions  of the application under 40 CFR 1042.210.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application must contain all the information required by  this part. It must not include false or incomplete statements or  information (see 40 CFR 1042.255). Include the information specified in  40 CFR 1042.205 except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must include the dates on which the test engines were built  and the locations where the test engines were built.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include a copy of documentation required by this part related to  maintenance and in-use compliance for operators, such as the Technical  File and onboard NOX verification procedures as specified by  the NOX Technical Code (incorporated by reference in Sec.   1043.100).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You are not required to provide information specified in 40 CFR  1042.205 regarding useful life, emission labels, deterioration factors,  PM emissions, or not-to-exceed standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must include a copy of your warranty instructions, but are  not required to describe how you will meet warranty obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may ask you to include less information than we specify in  this section as long as you maintain all the information required by  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related  to your application (see 40 CFR 1068.5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An authorized representative of your company must approve and  sign the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> See 40 CFR 1042.255 for provisions describing how we will  process your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Your application, including the Technical File and onboard  NOX verification procedures, is subject to amendment as  described in 40 CFR 1042.225.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Perform emission tests as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for  testing. For engines at or above 560 kW, you may use a development  engine that is equivalent in design to the engine being certified. For  Category 3 engines, you may use a single-cylinder version of the engine.  Using good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration most  likely to exceed an applicable emission standard, considering all  exhaust emission constituents and the range of installation options  available to vessel manufacturers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and  equipment specified in 40 CFR part 1042, subpart F, or in the  NOX Technical Code (incorporated by reference in Sec.   1043.100). We may require that your test be witnessed by an EPA  official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> We may measure emissions from any of your test engines or other  engines from the engine family, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other  facility. You must deliver the test engine to any test facility we  designate. The test engine you provide must include appropriate  manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other  emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine  block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon  as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment  we need.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If we measure emissions from one of your test engines, the  results of that testing become the official emission results for the  engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to  consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable  requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable  parameters to any point within the specified adjustable ranges (see 40  CFR 1042.115(d)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within  normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an  adjustable parameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> We may require you to test a second engine of the same or  different configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph  (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and  later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are  equivalent to the procedures otherwise required by this part, we may  reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Collect emission data using measurements to one more decimal  place than the applicable standard, then round the value to the same  number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded  emission levels to the emission standard for each emission-data engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Your engine family is considered in compliance with the emission  standards in Regulation 13 of Annex VI if all emission-data engines  representing   that family have test results showing emission levels at or below these  standards. Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission- data engine representing that family has test results showing an  emission level above an applicable emission standard for any pollutant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If we determine your application is complete and shows that the  engines meet all the requirements of this part, we will issue an EIAPP  certificate for your engines. We may make the approval subject to  additional conditions.</p>
