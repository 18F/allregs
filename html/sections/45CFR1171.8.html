Upon receipt of a request that will  take longer than ten (10) days to process, the NEH will send the  requester an acknowledgment letter that assigns the request an  individualized tracking number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grants of requests. If the NEH makes a determination to grant a  request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing.  The NEH will inform the requester of any applicable fees and will  disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable  fees. The NEH will mark or annotate records disclosed in part to show  the amount of information deleted pursuant to a FOIA exemption, unless  doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA  exemption. If technically feasible, the NEH will also indicate, on the  agency record(s) it provides, the location of the information deleted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Denials of requests. If the NEH makes a determination to deny a  request in any respect, the NEH will also notify the requester in  writing of: (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible  for the denial; (2) a brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial,  including any FOIA exemption applied by the NEH in denying the request;  (3) an estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, if  applicable. This estimate need not be provided if the volume is  otherwise indicated through deletion on the records disclosed in part,  or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an  applicable exemption; (4) a statement that the requester may appeal the  denial under Sec. 1171.10 and a description of the requirements to  appeal.</p>
