                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Any handler (including a grower-handler packing and handling apricots of his own production), whose packing facilities are located in an area where a Washington State Horticultural Division Inspection Office or Federal-State Inspector is not readily available to perform the required inspection may, prior to shipment, apply to the Committee for a permit authorizing a waiver of inspection. Applications shall be made on forms furnished by the Committee and shall contain such information as the Committee may require including: Name and address of applicant, location of packing facility, distance of packing facility from the nearest inspection office, period (by approximate beginning and ending dates) during which applicant expects to ship apricots, estimated quantity of apricots applicant expects to ship to fresh market during such period, manner in which the majority of applicant's fruit will be marketed (i.e., transported by applicant to market, sold at orchard to truckers, etc.), areas or markets to which applicant expects to ship the majority of his apricots. The application shall also contain an agreement by applicant (1) not to ship or handle any apricots unless such apricots meet the grade, size, maturity, container, and all other requirements of the amended marketing agreement and order in effect at time of handling, (2) to report periodically to the Committee on reporting forms furnished by the Committee the following information on each shipment: quantity, variety, grade, minimum size, container, date of shipment, destination, name and address of buyer or receiver, and such other information as the Committee may specify, (3) to pay applicable assessments on each shipment, (4) to have or cause to have each shipment of apricots inspected when such shipment is transported to a market or through a location en route to market where an inspector is available, and (5) to comply with such other safeguards as the Committee may prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Issuance of permit. Whenever the Committee finds and determines from the information contained in the application or from other proof satisfactory to the Committee that the applicant is entitled to a waiver from the inspection requirements of the amended marketing agreement and order at time of shipment, the Committee shall issue a permit authorizing the applicant to ship apricots in accordance with these administrative regulations and the terms and conditions of such permit.
