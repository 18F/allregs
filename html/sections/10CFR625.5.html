                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Ineligibility. In addition to any remedies available to the  Government under the Contract of Sale, in the event that a purchaser  fails to perform in accordance with applicable SPR petroleum sale  contractual provisions, and such failure is not excused by those  provisions, the Headquarters Senior Procurement Official, at his  discretion, may make such purchaser ineligible for future awards of SPR  petroleum sales contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of ineligibility. No purchaser shall be made  ineligible for the award of any SPR sales contract prior to notice and  opportunity to respond in accordance with the requirements of this  subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon the determination that a purchaser is to be considered for  ineligibility, the purchaser shall be sent by certified mail return  receipt requested, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notification that the Headquarters Senior Procurement Official  is considering making the purchaser ineligible for future awards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of the SPR sales contract which the purchaser  failed to comply with, along with a brief description of the events and  circumstances relating to such failure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Advice that the purchaser may submit in writing for  consideration by the Headquarters Senior Procurement Official in  determining whether or not to impose ineligibility on the purchaser, any  information or argument in opposition to the ineligibility; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Advice that such information or argument in opposition to the  ineligibility must be submitted within a certain time in order to be  considered by the Headquarters Senior Procurement Official, such time to  be not less than 21 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After elapse of the time period established under paragraph  (b)(1) of this section for receipt of the purchaser's response, the  Headquarters Senior Procurement Official, at his discretion, and after  consideration of the purchaser's written response, if any, may make the  purchaser ineligible for future awards of SPR petroleum sales contracts.  Such ineligibility shall continue for the time period determined   by the Headquarters Senior Procurement Official, as appropriate under  the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The purchaser shall be notified of the Headquarters Senior  Procurement Official's decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reconsideration.

When an NS is issued, it will cite  the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations (if any) in  which the latest version of the SSPs was published. Offerors are  cautioned that the Code of Federal Regulations may not contain the  latest version of the SSPs published in the Federal Register. Interested  persons may view the current SSPs at http://www.spr.doe.gov/reports/ SSPs/ssp.htm.</p><p class="depth0">A.5  Sales Notification List (SNL)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The SPR/PMO will maintain a Sales Notification List (SNL) of  those potential offerors who wish to receive notification of an NS  whenever one is issued. In order to assure that prospective offerors  will receive such notification in a timely fashion, all potential  offerors are encouraged to register on the SNL as soon as possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any firm or individual may complete the SNL on-line registration  process at http://www.spr.doe.gov.</p><p class="depth0">A.6  Publication of the Notice of Sale</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notification of a NS will be sent via e-mail to those who have  registered on the SNL referenced in Provision A.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The NS will be posted on the SPR web page http://www.spr.doe.gov  for public viewing. In addition, the issuance of the NS will be  publicized on the Fossil Energy web page http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/ reserves/.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A DOE press release, which will include the salient features of  the NS, will be made available to all news agencies.</p><p class="depth0">A.7  Penalty for False Statements in Offers To Buy SPR Petroleum</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Making false statements in an offer to buy SPR petroleum may  expose an offeror to a penalty under the False Statements Act, 18 U.S.C.  1001, which provides:</p><p class="depth0">Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or  agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals  or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes  any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or  makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain  any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined  under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Under 18 U.S.C. 3571, the maximum fine to which an individual or  organization may be sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. (including  Section 1001) is set at $250,000 and $500,000 respectively, unless there  is a greater amount specified in the statute setting out the offense, or  the violation is subject to special factors set out in Section 3571. The  United States Sentencing Guidelines also apply to violations of Section  1001, and offenders may be subject to a range of fines under the  guidelines up to and including the maximum amounts permitted by law.</p><p class="depth0">Section B--Sales Solicitation Provisions</p><p class="depth0">B.1  Requirements for a Valid Offer--Caution to Offerors</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Offerors are advised that the submission of an offer  electronically is required. Submission of an offer via the SPR's  specified on-line system will constitute a legal, binding offer. The use  of the combination of User Name and password to login and submit offers  constitutes an electronic signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A valid offer to purchase SPR petroleum must meet the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The offer must be submitted via the SPR's on-line system as  designated in the NS;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The offer must be received no later than the date and time set  for receipt of offers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The offer guarantee (see Provision B.12) must be received no  later than the time set for the receipt of offers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any amendments to the NS that explicitly require acknowledgment  of receipt must be properly acknowledged as specified in the NS; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Submission of an on-line offer in accordance with this provision  constitutes agreement without exception to all provisions of the SSPs  that the NS makes applicable to a particular sale, as well as to all  provisions in the NS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, offers may be  received by alternative means if circumstances preclude use of the  specified on-line system.</p><p class="depth0">B.2  Price Indexing</p><p class="depth0">The Government, at its discretion, may make use of a price indexing  mechanism to effect contract price adjustments based on petroleum market  conditions, e.g., crude oil market price changes between the times of  offer price submissions and physical deliveries. The NS will set forth  the provisions applicable to any such mechanism.</p><p class="depth0">B.3  Certification of Independent Price Determination</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The offeror certifies that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The prices in this offer have been arrived at independently,  without, for the purposes of restricting competition, any consultation,  communication, or agreement with any other offeror or competitor  relating to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Those prices;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The intention to submit an offer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The methods or factors used to calculate the prices offered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prices in this offer have not been and will not be knowingly  disclosed by the offeror, directly or indirectly, to any other offeror  or to any competitor before the time set for receipt of offers, unless  otherwise required by law; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> No attempt has been made or will be made by the offeror to  induce any other concern to submit or not to submit an offer for the  purpose of restricting competition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each submission of an offer is considered to be a certification  by the offeror that the offeror:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (a)(3) of this provision; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has been authorized in writing to act as agent for the  persons responsible for such decision in certifying that such persons  have not participated, and will not participate, in any action contrary  to (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As their agent does hereby so certify; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As their agent has not participated, and will not participate,  in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this  provision.</p><p class="depth0">B.4  Requirements for Vessels--Caution to Offerors</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of the same  statute. The NS will advise offerors of any general waivers allowing use  of non-coastwise qualified vessels or vessels built with Construction  Differential Subsidies for a particular sale of SPR petroleum. If there  is no general waiver, purchasers may request waivers in accordance with  Provision C.7, but remain obligated to complete performance under this  contract regardless of the outcome of that waiver process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The Department of Homeland Security's regulations concerning  Vessels Carrying Oil, Noxious Liquid Substances, Garbage, Municipal or  Commercial Waste, and Ballast Water (33 CFR part 151) and Reception  Facilities For Oil, Noxious Liquid Substances, and Garbage (33 CFR part  158) implement the requirements of the International Convention for the  Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the 1978  Protocol relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78). These regulations prohibit any  oceangoing tankship, required to retain oil or oily mixtures on-board  while at sea, from entering any port or terminal unless the port or  terminal has a valid Certificate of Adequacy as to its oil reception  capabilities. Marine terminals in support of the SPR (see Exhibit B, SPR  Delivery Point Data) have Certificates of Adequacy; however, they may  not have reception facilities for oily ballast, vessel sludge or oily  bilge water wastes. Accordingly, tankships will be required to make  arrangements for and be responsible for all costs associated with  appropriate disposal of such ballast, vessel sludge or oily bilge water  waste or permission to load may be denied.</p><p class="depth0">B.5  ``Superfund'' Tax on SPR Petroleum--Caution to Offerors</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Sections 4611 and 4612 of the Internal Revenue Code, provide for  the imposition of taxes on domestic and imported petroleum to support  the Hazardous Substance Response Fund (the ``Superfund'') and the Oil  Spill Liability Trust Fund (``Trust Fund''). These taxes are not  currently being collected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> DOE has already paid the Superfund and Trust Fund taxes on some  of the oil imported and stored in the SPR. However, no Superfund or  Trust Fund tax has been paid on any domestic oil stored in the SPR or on  imported oil stored prior to the imposition of these taxes. Because  domestic and imported crude oil for which no Superfund and Trust Fund  taxes have been paid and crude oils for which these taxes have been paid  have been commingled in the SPR, the Government retains records of the  tax status of all SPR petroleum in storage. The NS will advise  purchasers in the event these taxes are reimposed.</p><p class="depth0">B.6  Export Limitations and Licensing--Caution to Offerors</p><p class="depth0">Offerors for SPR petroleum are put on notice that export of SPR  crude oil is subject to U.S. export control laws implemented by the  Department of Commerce Short Supply Controls, codified at 15 CFR part  754, Sec. 754.2,   Crude oil. Subsections of Sec. 754.2 provide for the approval of  applications to export crude oil from the SPR in connection with  refining or exchange of SPR oil. Specifically, these subsections are  Secs. 754.2(b)(iii), and 754.2(f), Refining or exchange of Strategic  Petroleum Reserve Oil. These provisions implement the authority given to  the President by 42 U.S.C. 6241(i) to permit the export of oil in the  SPR for the purpose of obtaining refined petroleum for the U.S. market.  In addition, the President could waive the requirement for an export  license altogether. The NS will advise of any waivers under this  Presidential authority.</p><p class="depth0">B.7  State of Hawaii Access to SPR crude oil</p><p class="depth0">Potential offerors are advised that pursuant to subsection 161 (j)  of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6241 (j)), the  State of Hawaii, or a State-designated eligible entity authorized to act  on the State's behalf, may submit a ``binding offer'' for the purchase  of SPR petroleum. By submission of a binding offer, the State of Hawaii  is entitled to purchase up to three percent of the quantity of SPR  petroleum offered for sale or one-twelfth of the state's annual import  quantity barrels. The price will be equal to the volumetrically weighted  average price of the successful competitive offers for the applicable  Master Line Item. Furthermore, at the request of the Hawaii or its  designated eligible entity, the petroleum purchased will have first  preference in its scheduling for delivery. The State of Hawaii may also  enter into exchange or processing agreements to permit delivery of the  purchased petroleum to other locations, if a petroleum product of  similar value or quantity is delivered to the State.</p><p class="depth0">B.8  Issuance of the Notice of Sale</p><p class="depth0">In the event petroleum is sold from the SPR, DOE will issue a NS  containing all the pertinent information necessary for the offeror to  prepare a priced offer. A NS may be issued with a week or less allowed  for the receipt of offers. Offerors are expected to examine the complete  NS document, and to become familiar with the SSPs cited therein. Failure  to do so will be at the offeror's risk.</p><p class="depth0">B.9  Submission of Offers and Modification of Previously Submitted</p><p class="depth0">Offers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Unless otherwise provided in the NS, offers must be submitted  via SPR's on-line system and received no later than the date and time  set for offer receipt as specified in the NS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless otherwise provided in the NS, offers may be modified or  withdrawn on-line, provided that the modification or withdrawal is  accomplished prior to the date and time specified for receipt of offers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An offeror may withdraw an offer by deleting the submission in  accordance with the instructions provided for the SPR's on-line system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An offeror may modify a previously submitted offer by  withdrawing the original offer (see (c) above) and resubmitting the  replacement offer in its entirety no later than the date and time set  for offer receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> DOE will not release to the general public the identities of the  offerors, or their offer quantities and prices, until the Apparently  Successful Offerors have been determined. DOE will inform simultaneously  all offerors and other interested parties of the successful and  unsuccessful offerors and their offer data by means of a public ``offer  posting.'' The offer posting will normally occur within a week of  receipt of offers and will provide all interested parties access to  offer data as well as any DOE changes in the petroleum quantities or  quality to be sold. DOE will announce the date, time, and location of  the offer posting as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth0">B.10  Acknowledgment of Amendments to a Notice of Sale</p><p class="depth0">When an amendment to a NS requires acknowledgment of issuance, it  must be acknowledged by an offeror in accordance with instructions  provided in the NS. Such acknowledgment must be received as part of a  timely offer submission.</p><p class="depth0">B.11  Late Offers, Modifications of Offers, and Withdrawal of Offers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The date/time stamp affixed by the SPR's on-line system will be  the sole determinant of timely offer receipt. Any offer received after  the date and time specified in the NS for receipt will be considered  only if</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> it is received before award is made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> the Contracting Officer determines that the late receipt was due  solely to a failure of the Government's electronic receiving equipment,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> it is the only offer received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any modification or withdrawal of an offer is subject to the  same conditions as in (a) of this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this provision, a late  modification of an otherwise successful offer that makes its terms more  favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is  received and may be accepted.</p><p class="depth0">B.12  Offer Guarantee</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each offeror must submit an acceptable offer guarantee for each  offer submitted. Each offer guarantee must be received at the place  specified in the NS no later than the date and time set for receipt of  offers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An offeror's failure to submit a timely, acceptable guarantee  will result in rejection   of its offer. A properly executed copy of the offer guarantee(s) may be  faxed to the telephone numbers provided in the NS, with the original  sent to the Contracting Officer as provided in paragraph (d) of this  provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of each offer guarantee is $10 million or 5 percent  of the maximum potential contract amount, whichever is less. The maximum  potential contract amount is the sum of the products determined by  multiplying the offer's maximum purchase quantity for each master line  item, times the highest offer prices that the offeror would have to pay  for that master line item if the offer were to be successful. The SPR  on-line system will perform this calculation automatically as offer  information is entered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For each offer, an offeror must submit an irrevocable standby  letter of credit from a U.S. depository institution containing the  substantive provisions set out in Exhibit C, Offer Standby Letter of  Credit, all letter of credit costs to be borne by the offeror. If the  letter of credit contains any provisions at variance with Exhibit C or  fails to include any provisions contained in Exhibit C, nonconforming  provisions must be deleted and missing substantive provisions must be  added or the letter of credit will not be accepted. The depository  institution must be located in and authorized to do business in any  state of the United States or the District of Columbia, and authorized  to issue letters of credit by the banking laws of the United States or  any state of the United States or the District of Columbia. The  depository institution must be an account holder with the Federal  Reserve Banking system and a participant (on line) in the Fed's Fedwire  Deposit System Network funds transfer system. The original of the letter  of credit must be sent to the Contracting Officer at the address  specified in the NS.

Currently, there are eight MLIs, one for each of the eight crude oil  streams that the SPR has in storage. The NS may not offer all the  possible MLIs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each MLI contains multiple delivery line items (DLIs), each of  which specifies an available delivery method and the nominal delivery  period. Offerors are cautioned that the NS may alter the period of time  covered by each DLI. The NS will specify which DLIs are offered for each  MLI.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DLI-A covers petroleum to be transported by pipeline, either  common carrier or local. The nominal delivery period is one month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DLI-B covers petroleum to be transported by tankships. The  nominal delivery period is one month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DLI-E covers petroleum to be transported by barges (Note: These  DLIs are usually only applicable to deliveries of West Hackberry and Big  Hill Sweet and Sour crude oil streams from Sun Docks). The nominal  delivery period is one month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where the storage site is connected to more than one terminal or  pipeline, additional DLIs will be offered. The additional DLIs will  include DLI-H, covering petroleum to be transported by pipeline over the  period of a month; DLI-I, covering tankships, etc. The Notice of Sale  will specify any additional DLIs which may be applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The NS will state the total estimated number of barrels to be  sold on each MLI. An offeror may offer to buy all or part of the  petroleum offered on an MLI. In making awards, the Contracting Officer  shall attempt to achieve award of the exact quantities offered by the  NS, but may sell a quantity of petroleum in excess of the quantity  offered for sale on a particular MLI in order to match the DLI offers  received. In addition, the Contracting Officer may reduce the MLI  quantity available for award by any amount and reject otherwise  acceptable offers, if he determines, in his sole discretion after  consideration of the offers received on all of the MLIs, that award of  those quantities is not in the best interest of the Government because  the prices offered for them are not reasonable, or that, in light of  market conditions after offers are received, a lesser quantity than that  offered should be sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The NS will specify a minimum contract quantity for each DLI. To  be responsive, an offer on a DLI must be for at least that quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The NS will specify the maximum quantity that could be sold on  each of the DLIs. The maximum quantity is not an indication of the  amount of petroleum that, in fact, will be sold on that DLI. Rather, it  represents DOE's best estimate of the maximum amount of the particular  SPR crude oil stream that can be moved by that transportation system  over the delivery period. The total DOE estimated DLI maximums may  exceed the total number of barrels to be sold on that MLI, as the NS DLI  estimates represent estimated transportation capacity, not the amount of  petroleum offered for sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The NS will not specify what portion of the petroleum that DOE  offers on a MLI will, in fact, be sold on any given DLI. Rather, the  highest priced offers received on the MLI will determine the DLIs  against which the offered petroleum is sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> DOE will not sell petroleum on a DLI in excess of the DLI  maximum; however, DOE reserves the right to revise its estimates at any  time and to award or modify contracts in accordance with its revised  estimates. Offerors are cautioned that: DOE cannot guarantee that such  transportation capacity is available; offerors should undertake their  own analyses of available transportation capacity; and each purchaser is  wholly responsible for arranging all transportation other than terminal  arrangements at the terminals listed in Provision B.17, which shall be  made in accordance with Provision C.5. A purchaser against one DLI  cannot change a transportation mode without prior written permission  from DOE, although such permission will be given whenever possible, in  accordance with Provision C.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Exhibit A, SPR Crude Oil Comprehensive Analysis, contains  nominal characteristics for each SPR crude oil stream. Prospective  offerors are cautioned that these data may change with SPR inventory  changes. The NS will provide, to the maximum extent practicable, the  latest data on each stream offered.</p><p class="depth0">B.19  Line Item Information To Be Provided in the Offer</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Each offeror, if determined to be an ASO on a DLI, agrees to  enter into a contract under the terms of its offer for the purchase of  petroleum in the offer and to take delivery of that petroleum (plus or  minus 10 percent as provided for in Provision C.20) in accordance with  the terms of that contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An offeror may submit an offer for any or all the MLIs offered  by the NS. However, offerors are cautioned that alternate offers on  different MLIs are not permitted. For example, an offeror may offer to  purchase 1,000,000 barrels of SPR West Hackberry Sweet and 1,000,000  barrels of SPR West Hackberry Sour, but may not offer to purchase, in  the alternative, either 1,000,000 barrels of sweet or 1,000,000 barrels  of sour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An offeror may submit multiple offers. However, separate on-line  offers and offer guarantees must be submitted and each offer will be  evaluated on an individual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The following information will be provided to DOE by the offeror  on the SPR on-line offer form:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maximum MLI Quantity. The offer shall state the maximum quantity  of each crude oil stream that the offeror is willing to buy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Desired Qty. The offer shall state the number of barrels that  the offeror will accept on each DLI, i.e., by the delivery mode and  during the delivery period specified. The quantity stated on a single  DLI shall not exceed the Maximum MLI Quantity for the MLI. The offeror  shall designate a quantity on at least one DLI for the MLI, but may  designate quantities on more than one DLI. If the offeror is willing to  accept alternate DLIs, the total of its desired DLI quantities would  exceed its Maximum MLI quantity; otherwise, the total of its desired DLI  quantities should equal its Maximum MLI quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Price. The offer shall state the price per barrel for each DLI  for which the offeror has designated a Desired Qty. Where offers have  indicated quantities on more than one DLI with a different price on  each, DOE will award the highest priced DLI first. If the offeror has  the same price for two or more DLIs, it may indicate its first choice,  second choice, etc., for award of those items; if the offeror does not  indicate a preference, or indicates the same preference for more than  one DLI, DOE may select the DLIs to be awarded at its discretion. Prices  may be stated in hundredths of a cent ($0.000l). DOE shall drop from the  offer and not consider any numbers of less than one one-hundredth of a  cent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Accept Minimum Quantity. The offeror must choose whether to  accept only the Desired Qty (by deselecting the Accept Min Qty checkbox  to indicate an unwillingness to accept less than the Desired Qty for  that DLI) or, in the alternative, to accept any quantity awarded between  the offer's Desired Qty and the minimum contract quantity for the DLI  (by leaving the Accept Min Qty checkbox selected). However, DOE will  award less than the Desired Qty only if the quantity available to be  awarded is less than the Desired Qty.</p><p class="depth0">B.20  Mistake in Offer</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> After receiving offers, the Contracting Officer shall examine  all offers for mistakes. If the Contracting Officer discovers any  quantity discrepancies, he may obtain from the offeror oral or written  verification of the offer actually intended, but in any event, he shall  proceed with offer evaluation applying the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In case of conflict between the maximum MLI quantity and the  stated DLI quantities (for example, if a single stated DLI quantity  exceeds the corresponding maximum MLI quantity), the lesser quantity  will govern in the evaluation of the offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the event that the offer fails to specify a maximum MLI  quantity, the offer will be evaluated as though the largest stated DLI  quantity is the offer's maximum MLI quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In cases where the Contracting Officer has reason to believe a  mistake not covered by the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) may  have been made, he shall request from the offeror a verification of the  offer, calling   attention to the suspected mistake. The Contracting Officer may  telephone the offeror and confirm the request by electronic means. The  Contracting Officer may set a limit of as little as 6 hours for  telephone response, with any required written documentation to be  received within 2 business days. If no response is received, the  Contracting Officer may determine that no error exists and proceed with  offer evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)</em> of this  provision if an offeror alleges a mistake after receipt of offers and  before award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Head of the Contracting Activity may refuse to permit the  offeror to withdraw an offer, but permit correction of the offer if  clear and convincing evidence establishes both the existence of a  mistake and the offer actually intended. However, if such correction  would result in displacing one or more higher acceptable offers, the  Head of the Contracting Activity shall not so determine unless the  existence of the mistake and the offer actually intended are  ascertainable substantially from the NS and offer itself.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Head of the Contracting Activity may determine that an  offeror shall be permitted to withdraw an offer in whole, or in part if  only part of the offer is affected, without penalty under the offer  guarantee, where the offeror requests permission to do so and clear and  convincing evidence establishes the existence of a mistake, but not the  offer actually intended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In all cases where the offeror is allowed to make verbal  corrections to the original offer, confirmation of these corrections  must be received in writing within the time set by the Contracting  Officer or the original offer will stand as submitted.</p><p class="depth0">B.21  Evaluation of Offers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Contracting Officer will be the determining official as to  whether an offer is responsive to the SSPs and the NS. DOE reserves the  right to reject any or all offers and to waive minor informalities or  irregularities in offers received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A minor informality or irregularity in an offer is an  inconsequential defect the waiver or correction of which would not be  prejudicial to other offerors. Such a defect or variation from the  strict requirements of the NS is inconsequential when its significance  as to price, quantity, quality or delivery is negligible.</p><p class="depth0">B.22  Procedures for Evaluation of Offers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Award on each DLI will be made to the responsible offerors that  submit the highest priced offers responsive to the SSPs and the NS and  that have provided the required payment and performance guarantee as  required by Provision C.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> DOE will array all offers on an MLI from highest price to lowest  price for award evaluation regardless of DLI. However, DOE will award  against the DLIs and will not award a greater quantity on a DLI than  DOE's estimate (which is subject to change at any time) of the maximum  quantity that can be moved by the delivery method. Selection of the  apparently successful offers involves the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any offers below the minimum acceptable price, if any minimum  price has been established for the sale, will be rejected as  nonresponsive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All offers on each MLI will be arrayed from highest price to  lowest price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Offers may be rejected if they are below 95 percent of the  sales price, as estimated by the Government, of comparable crude oil  being sold in the same area at the same time. In making the sales price  estimate, the Government will consider both the ``Base Reference Price''  as defined in the Notice of Sale and other available information bearing  on the issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For price offers at or above 95 percent of the sales price  estimate, the Contracting Officer will determine price reasonableness,  considering offers received and prevailing market conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Price offers below 95 percent may be accepted only if the  Contracting Officer determines such action is necessary to achieve SPR  crude oil supply objectives and such offered prices are reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The highest priced offers will be reviewed for responsiveness to  the NS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In the event the highest priced offer does not take all the  petroleum available on the MLI, sequentially, the next highest priced  offer will be selected until all of the petroleum offered on the MLI is  awarded or there are no more acceptable offers. In the event that  acceptance of an offer against an MLI or a DLI would result in the sale  of more petroleum on an MLI than DOE has offered or the sale of more  petroleum on a DLI than DOE estimates can be delivered by the specified  delivery method, DOE will not award the full amount of the offer, but  rather the remaining MLI quantity or DLI capacity, provided such portion  exceeds DOE's minimum contract quantity. In the event that the quantity  remaining is less than the offeror is willing to accept, but more than  DOE's minimum contract quantity, the Contracting Officer shall proceed  to the next highest priced offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In the event of tied offers and an insufficient remaining  quantity available on the MLI or insufficient remaining capacity on the  DLI to fully award all tied offers, the Contracting Officer shall apply  an objective random methodology for allocating the remaining MLI  quantity or DLI capacity among the tied offers, taking into  consideration the quantity the offeror is willing to   accept as indicated in its offer. When making this allocation, the  Contracting Officer in his sole discretion may do one or more of the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Make an additional quantity or capacity available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Contact an offeror to determine whether alternative delivery  arrangements can be made; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Not award all or part of the remaining quantity of petroleum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The Contracting Officer may reduce the MLI quantity available  for award by any amount and reject otherwise acceptable offers if in his  sole discretion he determines, after consideration of the offers  received on all of the MLIs, that award of those quantities is not in  the best interest of the Government because the prices offered for them  are not reasonable; or if the Government determines, in light of market  conditions after offers are received, to sell less than the overall  quantity of SPR petroleum offered for sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Determinations of ASO responsibility will be made by the  Contracting Officer before each award. All ASOs will be notified and  advised to provide to the Contracting Officer within five business days  a letter of credit (See Exhibit D, Payment and Performance Letter of  Credit) as specified in Provision C.21, all letter of credit costs to be  borne by the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Compliance with required payment and performance guarantees will  effectively assure a finding of responsibility of offerors, except  where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An offeror is on either DOE's or the Federal Government's list  of debarred, ineligible and suspended bidders; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence, with respect to an offeror, comes to the attention of  the Contracting Officer of conduct or activity that represents a  violation of law or regulation (including an Executive Order); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Evidence is brought to the attention of the Contracting  Officer of past activity or conduct of an offeror that shows a lack of  integrity (including actions inimical to the welfare of the United  States) or willingness to perform, so as to substantially diminish the  Contracting Officer's confidence in the offeror's performance under the  proposed contract.</p><p class="depth0">B.23  Financial Statements and Other Information</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As indicated in Provision B.22(b)(9), compliance with the  required payment and performance guarantee will in most instances  effectively assure a finding of responsibility. Therefore, DOE does not  intend to ask for financial information from all offerors. However,  after receipt of offers, but prior to making award, DOE reserves the  right to ask for the audited financial statements for an offeror's most  recent fiscal year and unaudited financial statements for any subsequent  quarters. These financial statements must include a balance sheet and  profit and loss statement for each period covered thereby. A  certification by a principal accounting officer that there have been no  material changes in financial condition since the date of the audited  statements, and that these present the true financial condition as of  the date of the offer, shall accompany the statements. If there has been  a change, the amount and nature of the change must be specified and  explained in the unaudited statements and a principal accounting officer  shall certify that they are accurate. The Contracting Officer shall set  a deadline for receipt of this information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> DOE also reserves the right to require the submission of  information from the offeror regarding its plans for use of the  petroleum, the status of requests for export licenses, plans for  complying with the Jones Act, and any other information relevant to the  performance of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall set a  deadline for receipt of this information.</p><p class="depth0">B.24  Resolicitation Procedures on Unsold Petroleum</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the event that petroleum offered on an MLI remains unsold  after evaluation of all offers, the Contracting Officer, at his option,  may issue an amendment to the NS, resoliciting offers from all  interested parties. DOE reserves the right to alter the MLIs and/or  offer different MLIs in the resolicitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the event that for any reason petroleum that has been awarded  or allotted for award becomes available to DOE for resale, the following  procedures will apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If priced offers remain valid in accordance with Provision B.25,  the petroleum may go to the next highest ranked offer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If offers have expired in accordance with Provision B.25, the  Contracting Officer at his option may offer the petroleum to the highest  offeror for that MLI. The pertinent offeror may, at its option, accept  or reject that petroleum at the price it originally offered. If that  offeror rejects the petroleum, it may be offered to the next highest  offeror. This process may continue until all the remaining petroleum has  been allotted for award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the petroleum is not then resold, the Contracting Officer may  at his option proceed to amend the NS to resolicit offers for that  petroleum or add the petroleum to the next sales cycle.</p><p class="depth0">B.25  Offeror's Certification of Acceptance Period</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By submission of an offer, the offeror certifies that its priced  offer will remain valid for 10 calendar days after the date set   for the receipt of offers, and further that the successful line items of  its offer will remain valid for an additional 30 calendar days should it  receive a notification of ASO either by telephone or in writing during  the initial 10-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By mutual agreement of DOE and the offeror, an individual  offeror's acceptance period may be extended for a longer period.</p><p class="depth0">B.26  Notification of Apparently Successful Offeror</p><p class="depth0">The following information concerning its offer will be provided to  the apparently successful offeror by DOE in the notification of ASO:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identification of SPR crude oil streams to be awarded;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Total quantity to be awarded on each MLI and on each DLI;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Price in U.S. dollars per barrel for each DLI;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extended total price offer for each DLI;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Provisional contract number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any other data necessary.</p><p class="depth0">B.27  Contract Documents</p><p class="depth0">If an offeror is successful, DOE will make award using an NA signed  by the Contracting Officer.

It shall continue 24 hours per day,  seven days per week without interruption   from its commencement until loading of the vessel is completed and cargo  hoses or loading arms are disconnected. Any delay to the vessel in  reaching berth caused by the fault or negligence of the vessel or  purchaser, delay due to breakdown or inability of the vessel's  facilities to load, decisions made by vessel owners or operators or by  port authorities affecting loading operations, discharge of ballast or  slops, customs and immigration clearance, weather, labor disputes, force  majeure and the like shall not count as used laytime.

If the vessel is  tendered for loading later than 2400 hours on the firm agreed-upon date  of arrival, DOE will use its best efforts to have the vessel loaded as  soon as possible in its proper turn with other scheduled vessels, under  the circumstances prevailing at the time. In such instances, vessel  laytime shall commence when the vessel moors alongside (all fast).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For all hours or any part thereof of vessel laytime that elapse  in excess of the allowed vessel laytime for loading provided for in this  provision, demurrage shall be paid by DOE, for U.S.-flag vessels, at the  lesser of the demurrage rate in the tanker voyage or charter party  agreement, or the most recently available United States Freight Rate  Average (USFRA) for a hypothetical tanker with a deadweight in long tons  equal to the weight in long tons of the petroleum loaded, multiplied by  the most recent edition of the American Tanker Rate Schedule rate for  such hypothetical tanker and voyage. For foreign flag vessels, demurrage  shall be as determined in this provision, except that the London Tanker  Brokers' Panel Average Freight Rate Assessment (AFRA) and most recent  edition of the New Worldwide Tanker Nominal Freight Scale ``Worldscale''  shall be used as appropriate, if less than the charter party rate. For  all foreign flag vessel loadings that commence during a particular  calendar month, the applicable AFRA shall be the one that is determined  on the basis of freight assessments for the period ended on the 15th day  of the preceding month. The demurrage rate for barges will be the lesser  of the hourly rate contained in the charter of a chartered barge, or a  rate determined by DOE as a fair rate under prevailing conditions. If  demurrage is incurred because of breakdown of machinery or equipment of  DOE or its contractors (other than the purchaser), the rate of demurrage  shall be reduced to one-half the rate stipulated herein per running hour  and pro rata of such reduced rate for part of an hour for demurrage so  incurred. Demurrage payable by DOE, however, shall in no event exceed  the actual demurrage expense incurred by the purchaser as the result of  the delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In the event the purchaser is using more than one vessel to load  the contract quantity scheduled to be delivered during a single loading  window, the terms of this provision and the Government's liability for  demurrage apply only to the first vessel presenting its Notice of  Readiness in accordance with (a) of this provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The primary source document and official record for demurrage  calculations is the SPRCODR (see Provision C.19).</p><p class="depth0">C.10  Vessel Loading Expedition Options</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Notwithstanding Provision C.8(j)(1), in order to avoid  disruption in the SPR distribution process, the Government may limit  berthing time for any vessel receiving SPR petroleum to that period  required for loading operations and the physical berthing/unberthing of  the vessel. At the direction of the Government, activities not  associated with the physical loading of the vessel (e.g., preparing  documentation, gauging, sampling, etc.) may be required to be  accomplished away from the berth. Time consumed by these activities will  not be for the Government's account. If berthing time is to be  restricted, the Government will so advise the vessel prior to berthing  of the vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to paragraph (a) of this provision, the Government  may limit vessels calling at SPR terminals to a total of 24 hours for  petroleum transfer operations.

Should the  purchaser opt not to witness the testing, then the Government findings  will be binding on the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0">C.18  Determination of Quantity</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The quantity of crude oil delivered to the purchaser will be  determined by opening and closing tank gauges with adjustment for  opening and closing free water and sediment and water as determined from  shore tank samples where an automatic sampler is not available, or  delivery meter reports. All volumetric measurements will be corrected to  net standard volume in barrels at 60  deg.F, using the API Manual of  Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 11.1, Volume 1, Volume  Correction Factors (ASTM D1250) (IP 200); Table 5A--Generalized Crude  Oils, Correction of Observed API Gravity to API Gravity at 60  deg.F;  Table 6A--Generalized Crude Oils, Correction of Volume to 60  deg.F  Against API Gravity at 60  deg.F, latest edition, and by deducting the  tanks' free water, and the entrained sediment and water as determined by  the testing of composite all-levels samples taken from the delivery  tanks; or by deducting the sediment and water as determined by testing a  representative portion of the sample collected by a certified automatic  sampler, and also corrected by the applicable pressure correction factor  and meter factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The quantity measurements shall be performed and certified by  the DOE contractor responsible for delivery operations,   and witnessed by the U.S. government representative at the delivery  point. The purchaser shall have the right to have representatives  present at the gauging/metering, sampling, and testing. Should the  purchaser arrange for additional inspection services, such services will  be for the account of the purchaser. Any disputes shall be settled in  accordance with Provision C.32. Should the purchaser not arrange for  additional services, then DOE's quantity determination shall be binding  on the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0">C.19  Delivery Documentation</p><p class="depth0">The quantity and quality determination shall be documented on the  SPR/PMO Crude Oil Delivery Report (SPRCODR), SPRPMO-F-6110.2-14b (Rev 8/ 91) (see Exhibit E for copy of this form). The SPRCODR will be signed by  the purchaser's agent to acknowledge receipt of the quantity and quality  of crude oil indicated. In addition, for vessel deliveries, the time  statement on the SPRCODR will be signed by the vessel's Master when  loading is complete. Copies of the completed SPRCODR, with applicable  supporting documentation (i.e., metering or tank gauging tickets and  appropriate calculation worksheets), will be furnished to the purchaser  and/or the purchaser's authorized representative after completion of  delivery. They will serve as the basis for invoicing and/or  reconciliation invoicing for the sale of petroleum as well as for any  associated services that may be provided.</p><p class="depth0">C.20  Contract Amounts</p><p class="depth0">The contract quantities and dollar value stated in the NA are  estimates. The per barrel unit price is subject to adjustment due to  variation in the API gravity from the published characteristics, changes  in delivery mode and price index values, if applicable. In addition, due  to conditions of vessel loading and shipping or pipeline transmission,  the quantity actually delivered may vary by 10 percent for each  shipment. However, a purchaser is not required to engage additional  transportation capacity if sufficient capacity to take delivery of at  least 90 percent of the contract quantity has been engaged.</p><p class="depth0">C.21  Payment and Performance Letter of Credit</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within five business days of receipt of notification of  Apparently Successful Offeror, the Purchaser must provide to the  Contracting Officer an ``Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit''  established in favor of the United States Department of Energy equal to  100 percent of the contract awarded value and containing the substantive  provisions set out in Exhibit D. The purchaser must furnish an  acceptable letter of credit before DOE will execute the NA. The letter  of credit MUST NOT VARY IN SUBSTANCE from the sample at Exhibit D. If  the letter of credit contains any provisions at variance with Exhibit D  or fails to include any provisions contained in Exhibit D, nonconforming  provisions must be deleted and missing substantive provisions must be  added or the letter of credit will not be accepted. The letter of credit  must be effective on or before the first delivery under the contract and  remain in effect for a period of 120 days, must permit multiple partial  drawings, and must contain the contract number. The original of the  letter of credit must be sent to the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The letter of credit must be issued by a depository institution  located in and authorized to do business in any state of the United  States or the District of Columbia, and authorized to issue letters of  credit by the banking laws of the United States or any state of the  United States or the District of Columbia. The depository institution  must be an account holder with the Federal Reserve Banking system and a  participant (on-line) in the Fed's Fedwire Deposit System Network funds  transfer system. The issuing bank must provide documentation indicating  that the person signing the letter of credit is authorized to do so, in  the form of corporate minutes, the Authorized Signature List, or the  General Resolution of Signature Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All letter of credit costs will be borne by the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The letter of credit must be maintained at 100 percent of the  contract value of the petroleum remaining to be delivered as well as  delivered quantities for which payment has not been remitted, plus any  other charges owed to the Government under the contract. In the event  the letter of credit falls below the level specified, or at the  discretion of the Contracting Officer must be increased because of the  effect of the price indexing mechanism provided for in Provision B.2,  DOE reserves the right to demand the purchaser modify the letter of  credit to a level deemed sufficient by the Contracting Officer. The  purchaser shall make such modification within two business days of being  notified by the Contracting Officer by express mail or electronic means.  The purchaser is deemed to have received such notification the next  business day after its dispatch. If such modification is not made within  two days after purchaser is deemed to have received the notice, the  Contracting Officer may, on the 3rd business day, without prior notice  to the purchaser, withhold deliveries in whole or in part under the  contract and/or terminate the contract in whole or in part under  Provision C.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Within 30 calendar days after final payment under the contract,  the Contracting Officer shall authorize the cancellation of the letter  of credit and shall return it to the   bank or financial institution issuing the letter of credit. A copy of  the notice of cancellation will be provided to the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0">C.22  Billing and Payment</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Government will invoice the Purchaser at the conclusion of  each delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Payment is due in full on the 20th of the month following each  delivery month. Should the 20th of the month fall on a Saturday, Sunday,  or Federal holiday, payment will be due and payable in full on the last  business day preceding the 20th of the month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If an invoice is not paid in full, the Government may provide  the Purchaser oral or written notification that Purchaser is delinquent  in its payments; draw against the letter of credit for all quantities  for which unpaid invoices are outstanding; withhold all or any part of  future deliveries under the contract; and/or terminate the contract, in  whole or in part, in accordance with Provision C.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In the event that the bank refuses to honor the draft against  the letter of credit, the purchaser shall be responsible for paying the  principal and any interest due (see Provision C.24) from the due date.</p><p class="depth0">C.23  Method of Payments</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All amounts payable by the purchaser shall be paid by either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deposit to the account of the U.S. Treasury by wire transfer of  funds over the Fedwire Deposit System Network. The information to be  included in each wire transfer will be provided in the NS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Electronic funds transfer through the Automated Clearing House  (ACH) network, using the Federal Remittance Express Program. The  information to be included in each transfer will be provided in the NS.</p><p class="depth0">All wire deposit electronic funds transfer costs will be borne by  the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the purchaser disagrees with the amounts invoiced by the  Government, the purchaser shall immediately pay the amount invoiced, and  notify the Contracting Officer of the basis for its disagreement. The  Contracting Officer will receive and act upon any such objection.  Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute, and a purchaser  shall file a claim promptly in accordance with Provision C.32.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> DOE may designate another place, different timing, or another  method of payment after reasonable written notice to the purchaser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding any other contract provision, DOE may via a  draft message request a wire transfer of funds against the standby  letter of credit at any time for payment of monies due under the  contract and remaining unpaid in violation of the terms of the contract.  These would include but not be limited to interest, liquidated damages,  demurrage, amounts owing for any services provided under the contract,  and the difference between the contract price and price received on the  resale of undelivered petroleum as defined in Provision C.25. If the  invoice is for delinquent payments, interest shall accrue from the  payment due date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> No payment due DOE hereunder shall be subject to reduction or  set-off for any claim of any kind against the United States arising  independently of the contract.</p><p class="depth0">C.24  Interest</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Amounts due and payable by the purchaser or its bank that are  not paid in accordance with the provisions governing such payments shall  bear interest from the date due until the date payment is received by  the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest shall be computed on a daily basis. The interest rate  shall be in accordance with the Current Value of Funds rate as  established by the Department of the Treasury in accordance with the  Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1997 and published periodically in  Bulletins to the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual and in the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth0">C.25  Termination</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Immediate termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract in whole or  in part, without liability of DOE, by written notice to the purchaser  effective upon its being deposited in the U.S. Postal System addressed  to the purchaser as provided in Provision C.31 in the event that the  purchaser either notifies the Contracting Officer that it will not be  able to accept, or fails to accept, any delivery line item in accordance  with the terms of the contract.
