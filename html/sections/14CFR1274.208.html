                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Intellectual property rights. A cooperative agreement covers the disposition of rights to intellectual property between NASA and the recipient. If the recipient is a consortium or partnership, rights flowing between multiple organizations in a consortium must be negotiated separately and formally documented, preferably in the Articles of Collaboration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rights in patents. Patent rights clauses are required by statute and regulation. The clauses exist for recipients of the agreement whether they are--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Other than small business or nonprofit organizations (generally referred to as large businesses) or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Small businesses or nonprofit organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inventions. There are five situations in which inventions may arise under a cooperative agreement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recipient Inventions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subcontractor Inventions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NASA Inventions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> NASA Support Contractor Inventions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Joint Inventions with Recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recipient inventions. (1) A recipient, if a large business, is subject to section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2457) relating to property rights in inventions. The term ``invention'' includes any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation. Title to an invention made under a cooperative agreement by a large business recipient initially vests with NASA. The recipient may request a waiver under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations to obtain title to inventions made under the agreement. Such a request may be made in advance of the agreement (or 30 days thereafter) for all inventions made under the agreement. Alternatively, requests may be made on a case-by-case basis any time an individual invention is made. Such waivers are liberally and expeditiously granted after review by NASA's Invention and Contribution Board and approval by NASA's General Counsel. When a waiver is granted, any inventions made in the performance of work under the agreement are subject to certain reporting, election and filing requirements, a royalty-free license to the Government, march-in rights, and certain other reservations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A recipient, if a large business, is subject to section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2457) relating to property rights in inventions.

The term ``nonprofit organization'' is defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(i) and includes universities and other institutions of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Government obtains an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subcontractor inventions--(1) Large business. If a recipient enters into a subcontract (or similar arrangement) with a large business organization for experimental, developmental, research, design or engineering work in support of the agreement to be performed in

the United States, its possessions, or Puerto Rico, section 305 of the Space Act applies. The clause applicable to large business organizations is to be used (suitably modified to identify the parties) in any subcontract. The subcontractor may request a waiver under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations to obtain rights to inventions made under the subcontract just as a large business recipient can (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section). It is strongly recommended that a prospective large business subcontractor contact the NASA installation Patent Counsel or Intellectual Property Counsel to assure that the right procedures are followed. Just like the recipient, any inventions made in the performance of work under the agreement are subject to certain reporting, election and filing requirements, a royalty-free license to the Government, march-in rights, and certain other reservations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Large business.

In the event the recipient enters into a subcontract (or similar arrangement) with a domestic nonprofit organization or a small business firm for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed under the agreement, the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq. regarding ``Patent Rights in Inventions Made With Federal Assistance,'' apply. The subcontractor has the first option to elect title to any inventions made in the performance of work under the agreement, subject to specific reporting, election and filing requirements, a royalty-free license to the Government, march-in rights, and certain other reservations that are specifically set forth.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Work outside the United States. If the recipient subcontracts for work to be done outside the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, the NASA installation Patent Counsel or Intellectual Property Counsel should be contacted for the proper patent rights clause to use and the procedures to follow.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and in recognition of the recipient's substantial contribution, the recipient is authorized, subject to rights of NASA set forth elsewhere in the agreement, to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acquire by negotiation and mutual agreement rights to a subcontractor's subject inventions as the recipient may deem necessary; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If unable to reach agreement pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, request that NASA invoke exceptional circumstances as necessary pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2) if the prospective subcontractor is a small business firm or nonprofit organization, or for all other organizations, request that such rights for the recipient be included as an additional reservation in a waiver granted pursuant to 14 CFR 1245.1. The exercise of this exception does not change the flow down of the applicable patent rights clause to subcontractors. Applicable laws and regulations require that title to inventions made under a subcontract must initially reside in either the subcontractor or NASA, not the recipient. This exception does not change that. The exception does authorize the recipient to negotiate and reach mutual agreement with the subcontractor for the grant-back of rights. Such grant-back could be an option for an exclusive license or an assignment, depending on the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> NASA inventions. NASA will use reasonable efforts to report inventions made by its employees as a consequence of, or which bear a direct relation to, the performance of specified NASA activities under an agreement. Upon timely request, NASA will use its best efforts to a grant recipient first option to acquire either an exclusive or partially-exclusive, revocable, royalty-bearing license, on terms to be negotiated, for any patent applications and patents covering such inventions. This exclusive or partially-exclusive license to the recipient will be subject to the retention of rights by or on behalf of the Government for Government purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> NASA support contractor inventions. It is preferred that NASA support contractors be excluded from performing any of NASA's responsibilities under an agreement since the rights obtained by a NASA support contractor could work against the rights needed by the recipient. In the event NASA support contractors are tasked by NASA to

work under the agreement and inventions are made by support contractor employees, the support contractor will normally retain title to its employee inventions in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, 14 CFR part 1245, and E.O. 12591. In the event the recipient decides not to pursue right to title in any such invention and NASA obtains title to such inventions, upon timely request, NASA will use its best efforts to grant the recipient first option to acquire either an exclusive or partially exclusive, revocable, royalty-bearing license, upon terms to be negotiated, for any patent applications and patents covering such inventions. This exclusive or partially-exclusive license to the recipient will be subject to the retention of rights by or on behalf of the Government for Government purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Joint inventions. (1) NASA and the recipient agree to use reasonable efforts to identify and report to each other any inventions made jointly between NASA employees (or employees of NASA support contractors) and employees of Recipient. For large businesses, the Associate General Counsel (Intellectual Property) may agree that the United States will refrain, for a specified period, from exercising its undivided interest in a manner inconsistent with the recipient's commercial interest. For small business firms and nonprofit organizations, the Associate General Counsel (Intellectual Property) may agree to assign or transfer whatever rights NASA may acquire in a subject invention from its employee to the recipient as authorized by 35 U.S.C. 202(e). The agreement officer negotiating the agreement with small business firms and nonprofit organizations can agree, up front, that NASA will assign whatever rights it may acquire in a subject invention from its employee to the small business firm or nonprofit organization. Requests under this paragraph shall be made through the Center Patent Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NASA and the recipient agree to use reasonable efforts to identify and report to each other any inventions made jointly between NASA employees (or employees of NASA support contractors) and employees of Recipient.

Requests under this paragraph shall be made through the Center Patent Counsel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NASA support contractors may be joint inventors. If a NASA support contractor employee is a joint inventor with a NASA employee, the same provisions apply as those for NASA support contractor inventions (see paragraph (g) of this section). The NASA support contractor will retain or obtain nonexclusive licenses to those inventions in which NASA obtains title. If a NASA support contractor employee is a joint inventor with a recipient employee, the NASA support contractor and recipient will become joint owners of those inventions in which they have elected to retain title or requested and have been granted waiver of title. Where the NASA support contractor has not elected to retain title or has not been granted waiver of title, NASA will jointly own the invention with the Recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Licenses to recipient(s). (1) Any exclusive or partially exclusive commercial licenses are to be royalty-bearing consistent with Government-wide policy in licensing its inventions. It also provides an opportunity for royalty-sharing with the employee-inventor, consistent with Government-wide policy under the Federal Technology Transfer Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any exclusive or partially exclusive commercial licenses are to be royalty-bearing consistent with Government-wide policy in licensing its inventions. It also provides an opportunity for royalty-sharing with the employee-inventor, consistent with Government-wide policy under the Federal Technology Transfer Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon application in compliance with 37 CFR Part 404--Licensing of Government Owned Inventions, all recipients shall be granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government obtains title. Because cooperative agreements are cost sharing cooperative arrangements with a purpose of benefiting the public by improving the competitiveness of the recipient and the Government receives an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each recipient subject invention, it is only equitable that the recipient receive, at a minimum, a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in NASA inventions and NASA contractor inventions where NASA has acquired title.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Once a recipient has exercised its option to apply for an exclusive or partially exclusive license, a notice, identifying the invention and the recipient, is published in the Federal Register, providing the public opportunity for filing written objections for 60 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Preference for United States manufacture. Despite any other provision, the recipient agrees that any products

embodying subject inventions or produced through the use of subject inventions shall be manufactured substantially in the United States. ``Manufactured substantially in the United States'' means the product must have over 50 percent of its components manufactured in the United States. This requirement is met if the cost to the recipient of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all components required to make the product. In making this determination, only the product and its components shall be considered. The cost of each component includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the product and any applicable duty whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which determinations have been made in accordance with FAR 25.101(a) are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic. The intent of this provision is to support manufacturing jobs in the United States regardless of the status of the recipient as a domestic or foreign controlled company. However, in individual cases, the requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States, may be waived by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) upon a showing by the recipient that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Space Act agreements. Invention and patent rights in cooperative agreements must comply with statutory and regulatory provisions. Where circumstances permit, a Space Act Agreement is available as an alternative instrument which can be more flexible in the area of invention and patent rights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Data rights. Data rights provisions can and should be tailored to best achieve the needs and objectives of the respective parties concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The data rights clause at Sec. 1274.905 assumes a substantially equal cost sharing relationship where collaborative research, experimental, developmental, engineering, demonstration, or design activities are to be carried out, such that it is likely that ``proprietary'' information will be developed and/or exchanged under the agreement. If cost sharing is unequal or no extensive research, experimental, developmental, engineering, demonstration, or design activities are likely, a different set of clauses may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The primary question that must be answered when developing data clauses is what does each party need or intend to do with the data developed under the agreement. Accordingly, the data rights clauses may be tailored to fit the circumstances. Where conflicting goals of the parties result in incompatible data provisions, agreement officers for the Government must recognize that private companies entering into cooperative agreements bring resources to that relationship and must be allowed to reap an appropriate benefit for the expenditure of those resources. However, since serving a public purpose is a major objective of a cooperative agreement, care must be exercised to ensure the recipient is not established as a long term sole source supplier of an item or service and is not in a position to take unfair advantage of the results of the cooperative agreement. Therefore, a reasonable time period (i.e., depending on the technology, two to five years after production of the data) may be established after which the data first produced by the recipient in the performance of the agreement will be made public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Data can be generated from different sources and can have various restrictions placed on its dissemination. Recipient data furnished to NASA can exist prior to, or be produced outside of, the agreement or be produced under the agreement. NASA can also produce data in carrying out its responsibilities under the agreement. Each of these areas must be covered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For data, including software, first produced by the recipient under the agreement, the recipient may assert copyright. Data exchanged with a notice showing that the data is protected by copyright must include appropriate licenses in order for NASA to use the data as needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Recognizing that the dissemination of the results of NASA's activities is a primary objective of a cooperative

agreement, the parties should specifically delineate what results will be published and under what conditions. This should be set forth in the clause of the cooperative agreement entitled ``Publication and Reports: Non-Proprietary Research Results.'' Any such agreement on the publication of results should be stated to take precedence over any other clause in the cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Section 1274.905(b)(3) requires the recipient to provide NASA a government purpose license for data first produced by the Recipient that constitutes trade secrets or confidential business or financial information. NASA and the recipient shall determine the scope of this license at the time of award of the cooperative agreement. In addition to the purposes given as examples in Sec. 1274.905(b)(3), the license should provide NASA the right to use this data under a separate cooperative agreement or contract issued to a party other than the recipient for the purpose of continuing the project in the event the cooperative agreement is terminated by either party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> In accordance with section 303(b) of the Space Act, any data first produced by NASA under the agreement which embodies trade secrets or financial information that would be privileged or confidential if it had been obtained from a private participant, will be marked with an appropriate legend and maintained in confidence for an agreed to period of up to five years (the maximum allowed by law). This does not apply to data other than that for which there has been agreement regarding publication or distribution. The period of time during which data first produced by NASA is maintained in confidence should be consistent with the period of time determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section, before which data first produced by the recipient will be made public. Also, NASA itself may use the marked data (under suitable protective conditions) for agreed-to purposes.</p>
