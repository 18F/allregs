                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The appropriate TTB officer may approve emergency  variations from requirements specified in this part, where the  appropriate TTB officer finds that an emergency exists, the proposed  variations are necessary, and the proposed variations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Will afford the security and protection to the revenue intended  by the prescribed specifications;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Will not hinder the effective administration of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Will not be contrary to any provision of law.  Variations from requirements granted under this section are conditioned  on compliance with the procedures, conditions, and limitations stated in  the approval of the application. Failure to   comply in good faith with such procedures, conditions and limitations  will automatically terminate the authority for such variations and the  proprietor thereupon shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements  of regulations from which the variations were authorized. Authority for  any variation may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the  appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective  administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such  variation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A proprietor who desires to employ emergency  variations shall submit a written application to the appropriate TTB  officer. The application will describe the proposed variations and set  forth the reasons therefor. Variations will not be employed until the  application has been approved, except when an emergency requires  immediate action to correct a situation that is threatening to life or  property. Such corrective action may then be taken concurrent with the  filing of the application and notification of the appropriate TTB  officer via telephone.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1512-0046)  [T.D. ATF-104, 47 FR 23921, June 2, 1982, as amended by T.D. ATF-381, 61  FR 37003, July 16, 1996]</p>
