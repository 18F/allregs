Packages with a maximum capacity of 5 liters (1.32 gallons) or 5 kg (11 pounds) or less must be marked in a size appropriate for the size of the package.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Transitional exception. For domestic transportation, until January 1, 2017, the identification number markings are not subject to the minimum size requirements specified in this paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception for permanently marked packagings. For domestic transportation, a packaging manufactured prior to January 1, 2017 and permanently marked (e.g., by embossing or through a heat stamp process) with the appropriate identification number marking may continue in service until the end of its useful life regardless of whether the identification number markings meet the minimum size requirements specified in this paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proper shipping name for a hazardous waste (as defined in Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter) is not required to include the word ``waste'' if the package bears the EPA marking prescribed by 40 CFR 262.32.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Large quantities of a single hazardous material in non-bulk packages.

In addition to the marking required by paragraph (a) of this section, each non-bulk packaging containing a hazardous material subject to the provisions of Sec. 172.203(k) of this part, except for a Division 6.2 material, must be marked with the technical name in parentheses in association with the proper shipping name in accordance with the requirements and exceptions specified for display of technical descriptions on shipping papers in Sec. 172.203(k) of this part. A technical name should not be marked on the outer package of a Division 6.2 material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special permit packagings.

Each person who offers for transportation a hazardous material in a non-bulk package shall mark that package with the name and address of the consignor or consignee except when the package is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transported by highway only and will not be transferred from one motor carrier to another; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Part of a carload lot, truckload lot or freight container load, and the entire contents of the rail car, truck or freight container are shipped from one consignor to one consignee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Previously marked packagings. A package which has been previously marked as required for the material it contains and on which the marking remains legible, need not be remarked. (For empty packagings, see Sec. 173.29 of this subchapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> NON-ODORIZED marking on cylinders containing LPG.
