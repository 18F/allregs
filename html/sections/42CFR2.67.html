                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application. A court order authorizing the placement of an undercover agent or informant in a program as an employee or patient may be applied for by any law enforcement or prosecutorial agency which has reason to believe that employees or agents of the program are engaged in criminal misconduct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice. The program director must be given adequate notice of the application and an opportunity to appear and be heard (for the limited purpose of providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court order), unless the application asserts a belief that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The program director is involved in the criminal activities to be investigated by the undercover agent or informant; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The program director will intentionally or unintentionally disclose the proposed placement of an undercover agent or informant to the employees or agents who are suspected of criminal activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Criteria. An order under this section may be entered only if the court determines that good cause exists. To make this determination the court must find:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> There is reason to believe that an employee or agent of the program is engaged in criminal activity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other ways of obtaining evidence of this criminal activity are not available or would not be effective; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The public interest and need for the placement of an undercover agent or informant in the program outweigh the potential injury to patients of the program, physician-patient relationships and the treatment services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Content of order. An order authorizing the placement of an undercover agent or informant in a program must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Specifically authorize the placement of an undercover agent or an informant;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limit the total period of the placement to six months;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prohibit the undercover agent or informant from disclosing any patient identifying information obtained from the placement except as necessary to criminally investigate or prosecute employees or agents of the program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Include any other measures which are appropriate to limit any potential disruption of the program by the placement and any potential for a real or apparent breach of patient confidentiality; for example, sealing from public scrutiny the record of any proceeding for which disclosure of a patient's record has been ordered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limitation on use of information. No information obtained by an undercover agent or informant placed under this section may be used to criminally investigate or prosecute any patient or as the basis for an application for an order under Sec.  2.65 of these regulations.

L. 91-513 as amended by sec. 122(b), Pub. L. 93-282; 84 Stat. 1241 (42 U.S.C. 242a(a)), as amended by 88 Stat. 132.</p><p class="depth0">Source: 44 FR 20384, Apr. 4, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


Sec.  2a.1  Applicability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 303(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242a(a)) provides that ``[t]he Secretary [of Health and Human Services] may authorize persons engaged in research on mental health, including research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs, to protect the privacy of individuals who are the subject of such research by withholding from all persons not connected with the conduct of such research the names or other identifying characteristics of such individuals. Persons so authorized to protect the privacy of such individuals may not be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify such individuals.'' The regulations in this part establish procedures under which any person engaged in research on mental health including research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs (whether or not the research is federally funded) may, subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, apply for such an authorization of confidentiality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> These regulations do not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Authorizations of confidentiality for research requiring an Investigational New Drug exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) or to approved new drugs, such as methadone, requiring continuation of long-

term studies, records, and reports. Attention is called to 21 CFR 291.505(g) relating to authorizations of confidentiality for patient records maintained by methadone treatment programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorizations of confidentiality for research which are related to law enforcement activities or otherwise within the purview of the Attorney General's authority to issue authorizations of confidentiality pursuant to section 502(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 872(c)) and 21 CFR 1316.21.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary's regulations on confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records (42 CFR part 2) and the regulations of this part may, in some instances, concurrently cover the same transaction. As explained in 42 CFR 2.24 and 2.24-1, 42 CFR part 2 restricts voluntary disclosures of information from applicable patient records while a Confidentiality Certificate issued pursuant to the regulations of this part protects a person engaged in applicable research from being compelled to disclose identifying characteristics of individuals who are the subject of such research.


Sec.  2a.2  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Person means any individual, corporation, government, or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, partnership, association, or other legal entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Research means systematic study directed toward new or fuller knowledge and understanding of the subject studied. The term includes, but is not limited to, behavioral science studies, surveys, evaluations, and clinical investigations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Drug has the meaning given that term by section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Controlled drug means a drug which is included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811-812).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Administer refers to the direct application of a drug to the body of a human research subject, whether such application be by injection, inhalation, ingestion, or any other means, by (1) a qualified person engaged in research (or, in his or her presence, by his or her authorized agent), or (2) a research subject in accordance with instructions of a qualified person engaged in research, whether or not in the presence of a qualified person engaged in research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Identifying characteristics refers to the name, address, any identifying number, fingerprints, voiceprints, photographs or any other item or combination of data about a research subject which could reasonably lead directly or indirectly by reference to other information to identification of that research subject.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Psychoactive drug means, in addition to alcohol, any drug which has as its principal action an effect on thought, mood, or behavior.


Sec.  2a.3  Application; coordination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any person engaged in (or who intends to engage in) the research to which this part applies, who desires authorization to withhold the names and other identifying characteristics of individuals who are the subject of such research from any person or authority not connected with the conduct of such research may apply to the Office of the Director, National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Office of the Director, National Institute of Mental Health, or the Office of the Director, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 for an authorization of confidentiality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If there is uncertainty with regard to which Institute is appropriate or if the research project falls within the purview of more than one Institute, an application need be submitted only to one Institute. Persons who are uncertain with regard to the applicability of these regulations to a particular type of research may apply for an authorization of confidentiality under the regulations of this part to one of the Institutes. Requests which are within the scope of the authorities described

in Sec.  2a.1(b) will be forwarded to the appropriate agency for consideration and the person will be advised accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An application may accompany, precede, or follow the sumission of a request for DHHS grant or contract assistance, though it is not necessary to request DHHS grant or contract assistance in order to apply for a Confidentiality Certificate. If a person has previously submitted any information required in this part in connection with a DHHS grant or contract, he or she may substitute a copy of information thus submitted, if the information is current and accurate. If a person requests a Confidentiality Certificate at the same time he or she submits an application for DHHS grant or contract assistance, the application for a Confidentiality Certificate may refer to the pertinent section(s) of the DHHS grant or contract application which provide(s) the information required to be submitted under this part. (See Sec. Sec.  2a.4 and 2a.5.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A separate application is required for each research project for which an authorization of confidentiality is requested.

The recipient of a Confidentiality Certificate shall notify the Director of the Institute to which application was made of any proposal for such a significant change by submitting an amended application for a Confidentiality Certificate in the same form and manner as an original application. On the basis of such application and other pertinent information the Secretary will either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Approve the amended application and issue an amended Confidentiality Certificate together with a Notice of Cancellation terminating original the Confidentiality Certificate in accordance with Sec.  2a.8; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disapprove the amended application and notify the applicant in writing that adoption of the proposed significant changes will result in the issuance of a Notice of Cancellation terminating the original Confidentiality Certificate in accordance with Sec.  2a.8.


Sec.  2a.7  Effect of Confidentiality Certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A Confidentiality Certificate authorizes the withholding of the names and other identifying characteristics of

individuals who participate as subjects in the research project specified in the Certificate while the Certificate is in effect. The authorization applies to all persons who, in the performance of their duties in connection with the research project, have access to information which would identify the subjects of the research. Persons so authorized may not, at any time, be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify the research subjects encompassed by the Certificate, except in those circumstances specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A Confidentiality Certificate granted under this part does not authorize any person to refuse to reveal the name or other identifying characteristics of any research subject in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The subject (or, if he or she is legally incompetent, his or her guardian) consents, in writing, to the disclosure of such information,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Authorized personnel of DHHS request such information for audit or program evaluation of a research project funded by DHHS or for investigation of DHHS grantees or contractors and their employees or agents carrying out such a project. (See 45 CFR 5.71 for confidentiality standards imposed on such DHHS personnel), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Release of such information is required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301) or the regulations promulgated thereunder (title 21, Code of Federal Regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Neither a Confidentiality Certificate nor the regulations of this part govern the voluntary disclosure of identifying characteristics of research subjects.
