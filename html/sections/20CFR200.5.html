                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to establish  specific procedures necessary for compliance with the Privacy Act of  1974 (Pub. L. 93-579). These regulations apply to all record systems  containing information of a personal or private nature maintained by the  Railroad Retirement Board that are indexed and retrieved by personal  identifier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individual. The term ``individual'' pertains to  a natural person who is a citizen of the United States or an alien  lawfully admitted for permanent residence and not to a company or  corporation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> System of records. For the purposes of this section, the term  ``system of records'' pertains to only those records   that can be retrieved by an individual identifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Railroad Retirement Board. For purposes of this section, the  term ``Railroad Retirement Board'' refers to the United States Railroad  Retirement Board, an independent agency in the executive branch of the  United States Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Board. For purposes of this section the term ``Board'' refers to  the three member governing body of the United States Railroad Retirement  Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for requesting the existence of personally  identifiable records in a record system. An individual can determine if  a particular record system maintained by the Railroad Retirement Board  contains any record pertaining to him by submitting a written request  for such information to the system manager of that record system as  described in the annual notice published in the Federal Register. A  current copy of the system notices, published in accordance with  paragraph (i) of this section, is available for inspection at all  regional and district offices of the Board. If necessary, Board  personnel will aid requesters in determining what system(s) of records  they wish to review and will forward any requests for information to the  appropriate system manager. Also, requests for personal information may  be submitted either by mail or in person to the system manager at the  headquarters of the Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago,  Illinois 60611. Prior to responding to a request for information under  this subsection, the system manager shall require the individual  requesting such information to provide identifying data, such as his  full name, date of birth, and social security number. The system manager  shall respond to a request under this subsection within a reasonable  time by stating that a record on the individual either is or is not  contained in the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure of requested information to individuals. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon  request, an individual shall be granted access to records pertaining to  himself, other than medical records and records compiled in anticipation  of a civil or criminal action or proceeding against him, which are  indexed by individual identifier in a particular system of records.  Requests for access must be in writing and should be addressed to the  system manager of that record system as described in the annual notice  published in the Federal Register. Requests under this subsection may be  submitted either by mail or in person at the headquarters offices of the  Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The system manager shall, within ten working days following the  date on which the request is received in his office, render a decision  either granting or denying access and shall promptly notify the  individual of his decision. If the request is denied, the notification  shall inform the individual of his right to appeal the denial to the  Board. An individual whose request for access under this subsection has  been denied by the system manager may appeal that determination to the  Board by filing a written appeal with the Secretary of the Board,  Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611  within twenty working days following receipt of the notice of denial.  The Board shall render a decision on an appeal within thirty working  days following the date on which the appeal is received in the office of  the Secretary of the Board. The individual shall promptly be notified of  the Board's decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In cases where an individual has been granted access to his  records, the system manager shall, prior to releasing such records,  require the individual to produce identifying data such as his name,  date of birth, and social security number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Disclosure to an individual of his record may be made by  providing him, upon written request therefor, a copy of the record or  portion thereof which he reasonably describes in his request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An individual, and if such individual so desires, one other  person of his choosing, may review and have a copy made of his record  (in a form comprehensible to him) during regular business hours at the  location described as the repository of the record system containing  such records in the annual notice published in the Federal Register or  at such other location convenient to the individual as   specified by the system manager. If an individual is accompanied by  another person, the system manager may require written authorizations  for disclosure in the presence of the other person from the individual  before any record or portion thereof is released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special procedures--medical records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual  concerning whom the Railroad Retirement Board maintains medical records  in a system of records shall, upon written request, be permitted to  review such medical records or be furnished copies of such records if  the system manager of the system containing the requested records  determines that disclosure of the records or any portion thereof would  not be harmful to the individual's mental or physical health.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, upon review of the medical records requested, the system  manager determines that disclosure of such records or any portion  thereof might be harmful to the individual's mental or physical health,  he shall inform the individual that copies of the records may be  furnished to a physician of the individual's own choosing. If the  individual should select a physician to conduct such a review and direct  the Board to permit the physician to review the records, the system  manger shall promptly forward copies of the records in question to that  physician. The system manger shall inform the physician that the records  are being provided to him or her for the purpose of making an  independent determination as to whether release or the records directly  to the individual who has requested them might be harmful to that  individual. The physician shall be informed that if, in his or her  opinion, direct disclosure of the records would not be harmful to the  individual's mental or physical health, he or she may then provide the  copies to the individual. The physician shall further be informed that  should he or she determine that disclosure of the records in question  might be harmful to the individual, such records shall not be disclosed  and should be returned to the Board, but the physician may summarize and  discuss the contents of the records with the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The special procedure established by paragraph (e) of this  section to permit an individual access to medical records pertaining to  himself or herself shall not be construed as authorizing the individual  to direct the Board to disclose such medical records to any third  parties, other than to a physician in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)  of this section. Medical records shall not be disclosed by the Board to  any entities or persons other than the individual to whom the record  pertains or his or her authorized physician regardless of consent,  except as permissible under paragraphs (j)(1)(i), (iii), and (viii) of  this section and as provided under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1), (2) and (3)  of this section and of paragraph (d) of this section, if a determination  made with respect to an individual's claim for benefits under the  Railroad Retirement Act of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is  based in whole or in part on medical records, disclosure of or access to  such medical records shall be granted to such individual or to such  individual's representative when such records are requested for the  purpose of contesting such determination either administratively of  judicially.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The procedures for access to medical records set forth in  paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply with respect to requests  for access to an individual's disability decision sheet or similar  adjudicatory documents, access to which is governed solely by paragraph  (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> General exemptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems of records subject to  investigatory material exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). RRB-43,  Investigation Files, a system containing information concerning alleged  violations of law, regulation, or rule pertinent to the administration  of programs by the RRB or alleging misconduct or conflict of interest on  the part of RRB employees in the discharge of their official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Scope of exemption. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The system of records identified in this  paragraph is maintained by the Office of Investigations (OI) of the  Office of Inspector General (OIG), a component of the Board which  performs as its principal function activities pertaining to the  enforcement of criminal laws. Authority for the criminal law enforcement   activities of the OIG's OI is the Inspector General Act of 1978, 5  U.S.C. App.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applicable information in the system of records described in  this paragraph is exempt from subsections (c)(3) and (4) (Accounting of  Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G),  (H), and (I), (5), and (8), (Agency Requirements), (f) (Agency Rules)  and (g) (Civil Remedies) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To the extent that information in this system of records does  not fall within the scope of this general exemption under 5 U.S.C.  552(j)(2) for any reason, the specific exemption under 5 U.S.C.  552(k)(2) is claimed for such information. (See paragraph (g) of this  section.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasons for exemptions. The system of records described in this  section is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make available to the  individual named in the records, at his or her request, an accounting of  each disclosure of records. This accounting must state the date, nature,  and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of  the recipient. Accounting of each disclosure would alert the subjects of  an investigation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that  they are subjects of an investigation. The release of such information  to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant  information concerning the nature of the investigation, and could  seriously impede or compromise the investigation and lead to the  improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the  fabrication of testimony.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or  other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the  agency in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since the RRB is  claiming that this system of records is exempt from subsection (d) of  the Act, concerning access to records, this section is inapplicable and  is exempted to the extent that this system of records is exempted from  subsection (d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to  gain access to records pertaining to him or her, to request amendment of  such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend  such records, and to contest the information contained in such records.  Granting access to records in this system of records could inform the  subject of the investigation of an actual or potential criminal  violation of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and  scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his or her  activities, of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law  enforcement personnel, and could provide information to enable the  subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Granting access to such  information could seriously impede or compromise an investigation, lead  to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence,  or the fabrication of testimony, and disclose investigative techniques  and procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its  records only such information about an individual as is relevant and  necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order  of the President. The application of this provision could impair  investigations and law enforcement, because it is not always possible to  detect the relevance or necessity of specific information in the early  stages of an investigation. Relevance and necessity are often questions  of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is  evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be  established.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to  the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual  when the information may result in adverse determinations about an  individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.  The application of this provision could impair investigations and law  enforcement by alerting the subject of an investigation of the existence  of the investigation, enabling the subject to avoid detection or  apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or  to fabricate testimony. Moreover, in certain   circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot be required to  provide information to investigators, and information must be collected  from other sources. Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect  information from sources other than the subject of the investigation to  verify the accuracy of the evidence collected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person  whom it asks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by  the person, of the authority under which the information is sought and  whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes  for which the information is intended to be used; of the routine uses  which may be made of the information; and of the effects on the person,  if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.  The application of this provision could provide the subject of an  investigation with substantial information about the nature of that  investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) require an agency to publish a  Federal Register notice concerning its procedures for notifying an  individual at his request if the system of records contains a record  pertaining to him or her, how he or she can gain access to such a  record, and how he or she can contest its contents. Since the RRB is  claiming that the system of records is exempt from subsection (f) of the  Act, concerning agency rules, and subsection (d) of the Act, concerning  access to records, these requirements are inapplicable and are exempted  to the extent that these systems of records are exempted from  subsections (f) and (d) of the Act. Although the RRB is claiming  exemption from these requirements, RRB has published such a notice  concerning its notification, access, and contest procedures because,  under certain circumstances, RRB might decide it is appropriate for an  individual to have access to all or a portion of his or her records in  this system of records.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish in the  Federal Register notice concerning the categories of sources or records  in the system of records. Exemption from this provision is necessary to  protect the confidentiality of the sources of information, to protect  the privacy of confidential sources and witnesses, and to avoid the  disclosure of investigative techniques and procedures. Although RRB is  claiming exemption from this requirement, RRB has published such a  notice in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all subsection  (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records  with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is  reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any  determination about the individual. Since the Act defines ``maintain''  to include the collection of information, complying with this provision  would prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate,  relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In  collecting information for criminal law enforcement purposes, it is not  possible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant,  timely, and complete. Facts are first gathered and then placed into a  logical order to prove or disprove objectively the criminal behavior of  an individual. Material which may seem unrelated, irrelevant, or  incomplete when collected may take on added meaning or significance as  the investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could  interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report,  thereby impending effective law enforcement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable  efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such  individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal  process when such process becomes a matter of public record. Complying  with this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal  investigation to the subject of the investigation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1) requires an agency to promulgate rules  which shall establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified  in response to his or her request if any system of records named by the  individual contains a record pertaining to him or her. The application  of this provision could impede or compromise an investigation   or prosecution if the subject of an investigation was able to use such  rules to learn of the existence of an investigation before it could be  completed. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation  could inform the subject or others that their activities are under or  may become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects  to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly,  to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Since the RRB is  claiming that these systems of records are exempt from subsection (d) of  the Act, concerning access to records, the requirements of subsections  (f)(2) through (5) of the Act, concerning agency rules for obtaining  access to such records, are inapplicable and are exempted to the extent  that this system of records is exempted from subsection (d) of the Act.  Although RRB is claiming exemption from the requirements of subsection  (f) of the Act, RRB has promulgated rules which establish Agency  procedures because, under certain circumstances, it might be appropriate  for an individual to have access to all or a portion of his or her  records in this system of records. These procedures are described  elsewhere in this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies if an agency  fails to comply with the requirements concerning access to records under  subsections (d)(1) and (3) of the Act; maintenance of records under  subsection (e)(5) of the Act; and any rule promulgated thereunder, in  such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. Since the RRB  is claiming that this system of records is exempt from subsections  (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G), (H), and (I), (5), and  (8), and (f) of the Act, the provisions of subsection (g) of the Act are  inapplicable and are exempted to the extent that this system or records  is exempted from those subsections of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Specific exemptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Systems of records subject to  investigatory material exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). RRB-43,  Investigation Files, a system containing information concerning alleged  violations of law, regulation, or rule pertinent to the administration  of programs by the RRB or alleging misconduct or conflict of interest on  the part of RRB employees in the discharge of their official duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Privacy Act provisions from which exempt. The system of records  described in this paragraph is exempt from subsections (c)(3)  (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(1),  4G, H, and I (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules) of 5 U.S.C.  552a.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reasons for exemptions. The system of records described in this  section is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To prevent the subject of the investigations from frustrating  the investigatory process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement  purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of  sources and to maintain access to necessary sources of information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Request for amendment of a record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual may request  that a record pertaining to himself be amended by submitting a written  request for such amendment to the system manager as described in the  annual notice published in the Federal Register. Requests under this  subsection may be made either by mail or in person at the headquarters  offices of the Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago,  Illinois 60611. Such a request should include a statement of the  information in the record which the individual believes is incorrect, a  statement of any information not in the record which the individual  believes would correct the record, if included, and a statement of any  evidence which substantiates the individual's belief concerning the  inaccuracy of the information presently contained in the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to rendering a determination in response to a request  under this subsection, the system manager shall require that the  individual provide identifying data such as his name, date of birth, and  social security number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system manager responsible for the system of records which  contains the challenged record shall acknowledge receipt of the request  in   writing within ten working days following the date on which the request  for amendment was received in his office and shall promptly render a  decision either granting or denying the request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the system manager grants the individual's request to amend  his record, the system manager shall amend the record accordingly,  advise the individual in writing that the requested amendment has been  made and where an accounting of disclosures has been made, advise all  previous recipients of the record to whom disclosure of such record was  made and accounted for of the fact that the amendment was made and the  substance of the amendment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the system manager denies the individual's request to amend  his record, the system manager shall inform the individual that the  request has been denied in whole or in part, the reason for the denial  and the procedure regarding the individual's right to appeal the denial  to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Appeal of initial adverse determination on amendment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An  individual, whose request for amendment of a record pertaining to him is  denied, may appeal that determination to the Board by filing a written  appeal with the Secretary of the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844  Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. The written notice of appeal  should include a statement of the information in the record which the  individual believes is correct, a statement of any information not in  the record which the individual believes would correct the record, if  included, and a statement of any evidence which substantiates the  individual's belief concerning the inaccuracy of the information  presently contained in the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board shall consider the appeal and render a final decision  thereon within thirty working days following the date on which the  appeal is received in the office of the Secretary of the Board. An  extension of the thirty day response period is permitted for a good  cause upon notification of such to the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, upon consideration of the appeal, the Board upholds the  denial, the appellant shall be so informed in writing. The appellant  shall be advised that he may file a concise statement with the Board  setting forth his reasons for disagreeing with the Board's decision and  the procedures to be followed in filing such a statement of  disagreement. The individual shall also be informed of his right to  judicial review as provided under section 552a(g)(1)(A) of title 5 of  the United States Code. If disclosure has or will be made of a record  containing information about which an individual has filed a statement  of disagreement, that contested information will be annotated and a copy  of the statement of disagreement will be provided to past and future  recipients of the information along with which the Board may include a  statement of its reasons for not amending the record in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If, upon consideration of the appeal, the Board reverses the  denial, the Board shall amend the record, advise the appellant in  writing that such amendment has been made, and where an accounting of  disclosures has been made, advise all previous recipients of the record  to whom disclosure of such was made and accounted for, of the fact that  the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Disclosure of record to person other than the individual to whom  it pertains. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records collected and maintained by the Railroad  Retirement Board in the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act  and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act which contain information of  a personal or private nature shall not be disclosed to any person or to  another agency without the express written consent of the individual to  whom the record pertains.
