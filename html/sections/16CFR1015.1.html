                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations of this subpart provide information concerning  the procedures by which Consumer Product Safety Commission records may  be made available for inspection and the procedures for obtaining copies  of records from the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Official records  of the Consumer Product Safety Commission consist of all documentary  material maintained by the Commission in any format, including an  electronic format. These records include those maintained in connection  with the Commission's responsibilities and functions under the Consumer  Product Safety Act, as well as those responsibilities and functions  transferred to the Commission under the Federal Hazardous Substances  Act, Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, Refrigerator Safety Act,  and Flammable Fabrics Act, and those maintained under any other  authorized activity. Official records do not, however, include objects  or articles such as tangible exhibits, samples, models, equipment, or  other items of valuable property; books, magazines, or other reference  material; or documents routinely distributed by the Commission in the  normal course of business such as copies of Federal Register notices,  pamphlets, and laws. Official records include only existing records.  Official records of the Commission made available under the requirements  of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) shall be furnished to  the public as prescribed by this part 1015. A request by an individual  for records about himself or herself that are contained in the  Commission's system of records under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)  will be processed under the Privacy Act. A request by a third party for  records that are contained in the Commission's system of records under  the Privacy Act will be processed administratively under these  regulations with respect to the time limits and appeals rights  (Sec. Sec. 1015.5 and 1015.7), but substantively under the applicable  provisions of first the Freedom of Information Act and then the Privacy  Act. Documents routinely distributed to the public in the normal course  of business will continue to be furnished to the public by employees of  the Commission informally and without compliance with the procedures  prescribed herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. Section 6(a)(2)  of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 2055(a)(2), prohibits the  disclosure of trade secrets or other matters referred to in 18 U.S.C.  1905.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Attorney General's Memorandum on the 1974 Amendments to the  Freedom of Information Act published in February, 1975 is available from  the Superintendent of Documents and may be consulted in considering  questions arising under the Freedom of Information Act.  [42 FR 10490, Feb. 22, 1997, as amended at 62 FR 46196, Sept. 2, 1997]</p>
