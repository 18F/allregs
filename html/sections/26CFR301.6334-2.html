                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(9)</em> and (d) certain amounts  payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary, or other income  are exempt from levy. This section describes the income of a taxpayer  that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this  section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer  (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 301.6334-3 describes that sum  that will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's pay periods.  Pay periods are described in Sec. 301.6334-3. For the amounts exempt  from levy, see Sec. 301.6334-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> may be illustrated by  the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Delinquent taxpayer A, an individual, is employed by the M  Corporation and is paid wages on Friday of each week. Accordingly, A is  paid wages on Friday, February 16, 1990. On Saturday, February 17, A  deposits these wages into his personal checking account at Bank N. On  Tuesday, February 20, a notice of levy is served on the M Corporation  and also on Bank N. Amounts payable to A as wages on Friday, February  23, 1990, and any payday thereafter may be exempt from levy under  section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages A deposited in his account at  Bank N on February 17, 1990, is exempt from levy under section  6334(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and  is paid wages totalling $450 on Friday of each week. C also performs  services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $250 on Friday of  each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on O  Corporation with respect to the wages payable to C. A levy is not served  on P Corporation. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1  personal exemption. Under Sec. 301.6334-3, C is entitled to an  exemption from levy under 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly  pay period. However, because levy has not been made on C's salary paid  by the P Corporation ($250 per week) and that salary exceeds the weekly  amount ($101.92) to which C is entitled as exempt from levy, the  district director may treat no amount of C's wages paid by the O  Corporation as exempt from levy. If the district director requires such  treatment, the district director must notify O Corporation that no  amount of C's wages is exempt from levy and O Corporation may rely on  such notification; in the absence of such notification O Corporation  must treat $101.92 as exempt from levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and  is paid wages totalling $50 on Friday of each week. C also performs  services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $75 on Friday of each  week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on P Corporation  with respect to the wages and salary of C. C's filing status is single  and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under Sec. 301.6334-3, C is  entitled to an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9) totalling  $101.92 for each weekly pay period. The district director may notify P  Corporation that only $51.92 of C's wages is exempt from levy and P  Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such  notification, P Corporation must treat the entire $75 salary as exempt  from levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to  levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by  a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these  regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the  requirements of these regulations.
