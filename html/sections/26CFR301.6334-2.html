                                Sec. 301.6334-2  Wages, salary, and other income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 6334 (a)(9) and (d) certain amounts payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary, or other income are exempt from levy. This section describes the income of a taxpayer that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 301.6334-3 describes that sum that will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's pay periods. Pay periods are described in Sec. 301.6334-3. For the amounts exempt from levy, see Sec. 301.6334-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligible taxpayer income. Only wages, salary, or other income payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made

on the payor may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages, salary, or other income that is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made on the payor will be so exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Delinquent taxpayer A, an individual, is employed by the M Corporation and is paid wages on Friday of each week. Accordingly, A is paid wages on Friday, February 16, 1990. On Saturday, February 17, A deposits these wages into his personal checking account at Bank N. On Tuesday, February 20, a notice of levy is served on the M Corporation and also on Bank N. Amounts payable to A as wages on Friday, February 23, 1990, and any payday thereafter may be exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9). No amount of wages A deposited in his account at Bank N on February 17, 1990, is exempt from levy under section 6334(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer--(1) From wages, salary, or income from other sources where levy on all sources not made. In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary, or other income, the district director may elect to levy on only one or more sources while leaving other sources of income free from levy. If the wages, salary, or other income that the district director leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9), computed in accordance with Sec. 301.6334-3 (and are not otherwise exempt), the district director may treat no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income on which the district director elects to levy as exempt from levy. In such a case, the district director must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income is exempt from levy. The employer or other person upon whom the levy is served may rely on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, however, the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to Sec. 301.6334-3 as if that employer or other person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(1) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and is paid wages totalling $450 on Friday of each week. C also performs services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $250 on Friday of each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on O Corporation with respect to the wages payable to C. A levy is not served on P Corporation. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under Sec. 301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption from levy under 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly pay period. However, because levy has not been made on C's salary paid by the P Corporation ($250 per week) and that salary exceeds the weekly amount ($101.92) to which C is entitled as exempt from levy, the district director may treat no amount of C's wages paid by the O Corporation as exempt from levy. If the district director requires such treatment, the district director must notify O Corporation that no amount of C's wages is exempt from levy and O Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such notification O Corporation must treat $101.92 as exempt from levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where sources not levied upon are less than exempt amount. If the taxpayer's income upon which the district director does not levy is less than the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as exempt from levy, then an additional amount, determined to be exempt from levy pursuant to Sec. 301.6334-3, may be paid to the taxpayer from the sources of wages, salary, or other income upon which levy has been made. In such a case, the district director must designate those wages, salary, or other income from which the exempt amount is to be paid to the taxpayer, and must notify the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served of the amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary, or other income that is exempt from levy. The employer or other person may rely on such notification in paying over amounts pursuant to the levy. In the absence of such notification from the district director, the employer or other person upon whom the levy is served must determine the amount exempt from levy pursuant to Sec. 301.6334-3 as if that employer or other

person upon whom the levy is served is the only source of wages, salary, or other income. Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the district director in accordance with the terms of the levy. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(2) may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Delinquent taxpayer C is an employee of O Corporation and is paid wages totalling $50 on Friday of each week. C also performs services for P Corporation and is paid a salary of $75 on Friday of each week. On Tuesday, February 20, 1990, a levy is served on P Corporation with respect to the wages and salary of C. C's filing status is single and C is entitled to 1 personal exemption. Under Sec. 301.6334-3, C is entitled to an exemption from levy under section 6334(a)(9) totalling $101.92 for each weekly pay period. The district director may notify P Corporation that only $51.92 of C's wages is exempt from levy and P Corporation may rely on such notification; in the absence of such notification, P Corporation must treat the entire $75 salary as exempt from levy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. These provisions are effective with respect to levies made on or after July 1, 1989. However, any reasonable attempt by a taxpayer to comply with the statutory amendments addressed by these regulations prior to February 21, 1995 will be considered as meeting the requirements of these regulations.
