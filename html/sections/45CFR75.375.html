However, costs during suspension or after termination are allowable if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the non-Federal entity before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The costs would be allowable if the Federal award was not suspended or expired normally at the end of the

period of performance in which the termination takes effect.
