Each recipient shall keep such records and  submit to the responsible Department official or   his designee timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at such  times, and in such form and containing such information, as the  responsible Department official or his designee may determine to be  necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied  or is complying with this subpart. In general, recipients should have  available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent  to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of federally  assisted programs. In the case in which a primary recipient extends  Federal financial assistance to any other recipient or subcontracts with  any other person or group, such other recipient shall also submit such  compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to  enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit  access by the responsible Department official or his designee during  normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other  sources of information, and its facilities, as may be pertinent to  ascertain compliance with this subpart. Whenever any information  required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other  agency, institution, or person and that agency, institution, or person  fails or refuses to furnish that information, the recipient shall so  certify in its report and set forth the efforts which it has made to  obtain the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient  shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other  interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this  subpart and its applicability to the program for which the recipient  receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information  available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official  finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against  discrimination assured them by the Act and this subpart.
