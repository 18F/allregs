                            <p class="depth0">This section describes the calculations for calibrating various flow meters. After you calibrate a flow meter using these calculations, use the calculations described in Sec.  1065.642 to calculate flow during an emission test. Paragraph (a) of this section first describes how to convert reference flow meter outputs for use in the calibration equations, which are presented on a molar basis. The remaining paragraphs describe the calibration calculations that are specific to certain types of flow meters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Reference meter conversions. The calibration equations in this section use molar flow rate, nref, as a reference quantity. If your reference meter outputs a flow rate in a different quantity, such as standard volume rate, Vstdref, actual volume rate, Vactref, or mass rate, mref, convert your reference meter output to a molar flow rate using the following equations, noting that while values for volume rate, mass rate, pressure, temperature, and molar mass may change during an emission test, you should ensure that they are as constant as practical for each individual set point during a flow meter calibration:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.017

This section describes the governing equations and permissible assumptions for calibrating a venturi and calculating flow using a venturi. Because a subsonic venturi (SSV) and a critical-flow venturi (CFV) both operate similarly, their governing equations are nearly the same, except for the equation describing their pressure ratio, r (i.e., rSSV versus rCFV). These governing equations assume one-dimensional isentropic inviscid compressible flow of an ideal gas. In paragraph (c)(4) of this section, we describe other assumptions that you may make, depending upon how you conduct your emission tests. If we do not allow you to assume that the measured flow is an ideal gas, the governing equations include a first-order correction for the behavior of a real gas; namely, the compressibility factor, Z. If good engineering judgment dictates using a value other than Z=1, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values of Z as a function of measured pressures and temperatures, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment. Note that the equation for the flow coefficient, Cf, is based on the ideal gas assumption that the isentropic exponent, g, is equal to the ratio of specific heats, Cp/Cv. If good engineering judgment dictates using a real gas isentropic exponent, you may either use an appropriate equation of state to determine values of g as a function of measured pressures and temperatures, or you may develop your own calibration equations based on good engineering judgment.

and g as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
