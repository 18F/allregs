The supplying by such  pharmacies of blood products to a practitioner licensed to administer  such blood products for his use in the course of his professional  practice or to other pharmacies to meet temporary inventory shortages  are not acts which require such pharmacies to register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Practitioners who are licensed by law to prescribe or administer  drugs and who manufacture blood products solely for use in the course of  their professional practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons who manufacture blood products which are not for sale,  rather, are solely for use in research, teaching, or analysis, including  laboratory samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Carriers, by reason of their receipt, carriage, holding, or  delivery of blood products in the usual course of business as carriers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Persons who engage solely in the manufacture of in vitro  diagnostic blood products and reagents not subject to licensing under  section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).
