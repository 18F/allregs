                            <p class="depth0">Section 401(h) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act  of 1959 (29 U.S.C. 481) provides that if,   upon application of any member of a local labor organization, the  Secretary of Labor finds, after hearing in accordance with the  Administrative Procedure Act, that the constitution and bylaws of such  labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for the removal  of an elected officer guilty of serious misconduct, such officer may be  removed for cause shown and after notice and hearing, by the members in  good standing voting in a secret ballot. Section 401(i) (29 U.S.C. 481)  requires the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing  minimum standards and procedures for determining the adequacy of the  removal procedures referred to in section 401(h). Section 402(a) (29  U.S.C. 482) provides that a member of a labor organization who has  exhausted the available internal remedies of such organization and of  any parent body, or who has invoked such remedies without obtaining a  final decision within three months, may file a complaint with the  Secretary within one month thereafter alleging violation of section 401  (including violation of the constitution and bylaws of the labor  organization pertaining to the removal of officers). Section 402(b) (29  U.S.C. 482) provides that upon suit initiated by the Secretary, a  Federal court may direct the conduct of a hearing and vote upon the  removal of officers under the supervision of the Secretary, and in  accordance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary may  prescribe. It is the purpose of this part to implement those sections by  prescribing regulations relating to the procedures and standards for  determining the adequacy of removal procedures and the procedures for  holding elections for the removal of officers.</p>
