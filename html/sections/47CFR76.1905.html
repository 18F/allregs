                                Sec.  76.1905  Petitions to modify encoding rules for new services
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The encoding rules for defined business models in Sec.  76.1904  reflect the conventional methods for packaging programs in the MVPD  market as of December 31, 2002, and are presumed to be the appropriate  rules for defined business models. A covered entity may petition the  Commission for approval to allow within a defined business model, other  than unencrypted broadcast television, the encoding of a new service in  a manner different from the encoding rules set forth in Sec.   76.1904(b)(1) and (2). No such petition will be approved under the  public interest test set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section  unless the new service differs from existing services provided by any  covered entity under the applicable defined business model prior to  December 31, 2002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> and (2) shall describe:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The defined business model, the new service, and the proposed  encoding terms, including the use of copy never and copy one generation  encoding, and the encoding of content with respect to ``pause'' set  forth in Sec.  76.1904(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the claimed benefit to consumers of the new service,  including, but not limited to, the availability of content in earlier  release windows, more favorable terms, innovation or original  programming, outweighs the limitation on the consumers' control over the  new service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ways in which the new service differs from existing services  offered by any covered entity within the applicable defined business  model prior to December 31, 2002;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All other pertinent facts and considerations relied on to  support a determination that grant of the petition would serve the  public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Factual allegations shall be supported by affidavit or  declaration of a person or persons with actual knowledge of the facts,  and exhibits shall be verified by the person who prepares them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Petition process--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public notice. The Commission shall give  public notice of any such petition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comments. Interested persons may submit comments or oppositions  to the petition within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice  of the filing of such petition. Comments or oppositions shall be served  on the petitioner and on all persons listed in petitioner's certificate  of service, and shall contain a detailed full statement of any facts or  considerations relied on. Factual allegations shall be supported by  affidavit or declaration of a person or persons with actual knowledge of  the facts, and exhibits shall be verified by the person who prepares  them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Replies. The petitioner may file a reply to the comments or  oppositions within ten (10) days after their submission, which shall be  served on all persons who have filed pleadings and shall also contain a  detailed full showing, supported by affidavit or declaration, of any  additional facts or considerations relied on. There shall be no further  pleadings filed after petitioner's reply, unless authorized by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Commission determination as to encoding rules for a new service  within a defined business model. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Proceedings initiated by petitions  pursuant to this section shall be permit-but-disclose proceedings,  unless otherwise specified by the Commission. The covered entity shall  have the burden of proof to establish that the proposed change in  encoding rules for a new service is in the public interest. In making  its determination, the Commission shall take into account the following  factors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Whether the benefit to consumers of the new service, including  but not limited to earlier release windows, more favorable terms,  innovation or original programming, outweighs the limitation on the  consumers' control over the new service;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ways in which the new service differs from existing services  offered by any covered entity within the applicable defined business  model prior to December 31, 2002; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Commission may specify other procedures, such as oral  argument, evidentiary hearing, or further written submissions directed  to particular aspects, as it deems appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A petition may, upon request of the petitioner, be dismissed  without prejudice as a matter of right prior to the adoption date of any  final action taken by the Commission with respect to the petition. A  petitioner's request for the return of a petition will be regarded as a  request for dismissal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Complaint regarding a new service not subject to petition. In an  instance in which an interested party has a substantial basis to believe  and does believe in good faith that a new service within a defined  business model has been launched without a petition as required by this  section, such party may file a complaint pursuant to Sec.  76.7.</p>
