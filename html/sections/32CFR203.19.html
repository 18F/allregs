                            <p class="depth0">DoD Components will establish an appeals process to settle potential  disputes between the Department of Defense and the public regarding  certain decisions arising out of the TAPP process. The Department of  Defense recognizes that the RAB/TRC may disagree with the findings of  the installation commander that a proposed TAPP project is ineligible,  either because of the availability of alternate sources of assistance or  because the project does not meet the eligibility criteria established  in this part. It is in the best interests of the Department of Defense  and the community members of RABs and TRCs to anticipate and avoid  disputes and to work cooperatively to resolve potential differences of  opinion. However, in certain circumstances, the RAB/TRC community  members may feel that their needs were not adequately served by the  decisions of the Department of Defense. In this instance, the  hierarchical structure and chain-of-command within each DoD Component  will serve as the avenue for appeal. Appeals will be considered within  the chain-of-command, and, in general, will be resolved at the lowest  level possible. The highest level of appeal will be at the DoD Component  Deputy Assistant Secretary level with authority over the DERP and BRAC  environmental programs. Inherently governmental functions, such as the  procurement process governed by the FAR, are not subject to appeal.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
