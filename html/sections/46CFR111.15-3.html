A large battery installation is one connected to a battery charger that has an output of more than 2 kw computed from the highest possible charging current and the rated voltage of the battery installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Moderate. A moderate battery installation is one connected to a battery charger that has an output of between 0.2 kw and 2 kw computed from the highest possible charging current and the rated voltage of the battery installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Small. A small battery installation is one connected to a battery charger that has an output of less than 0.2 kw computed from the highest possible charging current and the rated voltage of the battery installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Batteries that generate less hydrogen under normal charging and discharging conditions than an equivalent category of lead-acid batteries (e.g., sealed batteries) may have their battery category reduced to an equivalent category of lead-acid batteries.
