                            <p class="depth0">Per Sec. 261.4(a)(24)(vi)(F) of this chapter, an owner or operator of a reclamation or intermediate facility must have financial assurance as a condition of the exclusion as required under Sec. 261.4(a)(24) of this chapter. He must choose from the options as specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Trust fund. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator. The trustee must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing a trust fund which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting an originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement to the Regional Administrator. The trustee must be an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The wording of the trust agreement must be identical to the wording specified in Sec. 261.151(a)(1), and the trust agreement must be accompanied by a formal certification of acknowledgment (for example, see Sec. 261.151(a)(2)). Schedule A of the trust agreement must be updated within 60 days after a change in the amount of the current cost estimate covered by the agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The trust fund must be funded for the full amount of the current cost estimate before it may be relied upon to satisfy the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whenever the current cost estimate changes, the owner or operator must compare the new estimate with the trustee's most recent annual valuation of the trust fund. If the value of the fund is less than the amount of the new estimate, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the change in the cost estimate, must either deposit an amount into the fund so that its value after this deposit at least equals the

amount of the current cost estimate, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the difference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the value of the trust fund is greater than the total amount of the current cost estimate, the owner or operator may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current cost estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If an owner or operator substitutes other financial assurance as specified in this section for all or part of the trust fund, he may submit a written request to the Regional Administrator for release of the amount in excess of the current cost estimate covered by the trust fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Within 60 days after receiving a request from the owner or operator for release of funds as specified in paragraph (a) (5) or (6) of this section, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to release to the owner or operator such funds as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing. If the owner or operator begins final closure under subpart G of 40 CFR part 264 or 265, an owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial or final closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. The owner or operator may request reimbursements for partial closure only if sufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to cover the maximum costs of closing the facility over its remaining operating life. No later than 60 days after receiving bills for partial or final closure activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements in those amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing, if the Regional Administrator determines that the partial or final closure expenditures are in accordance with the approved closure plan, or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the maximum cost of closure over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly greater than the value of the trust fund, he may withhold reimbursements of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with Sec. 265.143(i) that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the trustee to make such reimbursements, he will provide to the owner or operator a detailed written statement of reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The Regional Administrator will agree to termination of the trust when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Surety bond guaranteeing payment into a trust fund. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the Regional Administrator. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the bond to the Regional Administrator. The surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The wording of the surety bond must be identical to the wording specified in Sec. 261.151(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator who uses a surety bond to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the bond, all payments made thereunder will be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the surety bond; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Until the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Payments into the trust fund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see Sec. 261.151(a)) to show current cost estimates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The bond must guarantee that the owner or operator will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum of the bond before loss of the exclusion under Sec. 261.4(a)(24) of this chapter or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fund the standby trust fund in an amount equal to the penal sum within 15 days after an administrative order to begin closure issued by the Regional Administrator becomes final, or within 15 days after an order to begin closure is issued by a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, and obtain the Regional Administrator's written approval of the assurance provided, within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice of cancellation of the bond from the surety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Under the terms of the bond, the surety will become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The penal sum of the bond must be in an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Whenever the current cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the penal sum, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the penal sum to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current cost estimate decreases, the penal sum may be reduced to the amount of the current cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Under the terms of the bond, the surety may cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, as evidenced by the return receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The owner or operator may cancel the bond if the Regional Administrator has given prior written consent based on his receipt of evidence of alternate financial assurance as specified in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Letter of credit. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the letter to the Regional Administrator. The issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter-of-credit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining an irrevocable standby letter of credit which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting the letter to the Regional Administrator. The issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter-of-credit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The wording of the letter of credit must be identical to the wording specified in Sec. 261.151(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An owner or operator who uses a letter of credit to satisfy the requirements of this section must also establish a standby trust fund. Under the terms of the letter of credit, all amounts paid pursuant to a draft by the Regional Administrator will be deposited by the issuing institution directly into the standby trust fund in accordance with instructions from the Regional Administrator. This standby trust fund must meet the requirements of the trust fund specified in paragraph (a) of this section, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An originally signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the Regional Administrator with the letter of credit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unless the standby trust fund is funded pursuant to the requirements of this section, the following are not required by these regulations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Payments into the trust fund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Updating of Schedule A of the trust agreement (see Sec. 261.151(a)) to show current cost estimates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Annual valuations as required by the trust agreement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Notices of nonpayment as required by the trust agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The letter of credit must be accompanied by a letter from the owner or operator referring to the letter of

credit by number, issuing institution, and date, and providing the following information: The EPA Identification Number (if any issued), name, and address of the facility, and the amount of funds assured for the facility by the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The letter of credit must be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least 1 year. The letter of credit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at least 1 year unless, at least 120 days before the current expiration date, the issuing institution notifies both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator by certified mail of a decision not to extend the expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of credit, the 120 days will begin on the date when both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator have received the notice, as evidenced by the return receipts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The letter of credit must be issued in an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Whenever the current cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the amount of the credit, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the amount of the credit to be increased so that it at least equals the current cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current cost estimate decreases, the amount of the credit may be reduced to the amount of the current cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Following a determination by the Regional Administrator that the hazardous secondary materials do not meet the conditions of the exclusion under Sec. 261.4(a)(24), the Regional Administrator may draw on the letter of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If the owner or operator does not establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain written approval of such alternate assurance from the Regional Administrator within 90 days after receipt by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator of a notice from the issuing institution that it has decided not to extend the letter of credit beyond the current expiration date, the Regional Administrator will draw on the letter of credit. The Regional Administrator may delay the drawing if the issuing institution grants an extension of the term of the credit. During the last 30 days of any such extension the Regional Administrator will draw on the letter of credit if the owner or operator has failed to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section and obtain written approval of such assurance from the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The Regional Administrator will return the letter of credit to the issuing institution for termination when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Insurance. (1) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining insurance which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of such insurance to the Regional Administrator At a minimum, the insurer must be licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by obtaining insurance which conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and submitting a certificate of such insurance to the Regional Administrator At a minimum, the insurer must be licensed to transact the business of insurance, or eligible to provide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer, in one or more States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The wording of the certificate of insurance must be identical to the wording specified in Sec. 261.151(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The insurance policy must be issued for a face amount at least equal to the current cost estimate, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The term ``face amount'' means the total amount the insurer is obligated to pay under the policy. Actual payments by the insurer will not change the face amount, although the insurer's future liability will be lowered by the amount of the payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The insurance policy must guarantee that funds will be available whenever needed to pay the cost of removal of all hazardous secondary materials from the unit, to pay the cost of

decontamination of the unit, to pay the costs of the performance of activities required under subpart G of 40 CFR parts 264 or 265, as applicable, for the facilities covered by this policy. The policy must also guarantee that once funds are needed, the insurer will be responsible for paying out funds, up to an amount equal to the face amount of the policy, upon the direction of the Regional Administrator, to such party or parties as the Regional Administrator specifies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> After beginning partial or final closure under 40 CFR parts 264 or 265, as applicable, an owner or operator or any other authorized person may request reimbursements for closure expenditures by submitting itemized bills to the Regional Administrator. The owner or operator may request reimbursements only if the remaining value of the policy is sufficient to cover the maximum costs of closing the facility over its remaining operating life. Within 60 days after receiving bills for closure activities, the Regional Administrator will instruct the insurer to make reimbursements in such amounts as the Regional Administrator specifies in writing if the Regional Administrator determines that the expenditures are in accordance with the approved plan or otherwise justified. If the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the maximum cost over the remaining life of the facility will be significantly greater than the face amount of the policy, he may withhold reimbursement of such amounts as he deems prudent until he determines, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, that the owner or operator is no longer required to maintain financial assurance for the particular facility. If the Regional Administrator does not instruct the insurer to make such reimbursements, he will provide to the owner or operator a detailed written statement of reasons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator must maintain the policy in full force and effect until the Regional Administrator consents to termination of the policy by the owner or operator as specified in paragraph (i)(10) of this section. Failure to pay the premium, without substitution of alternate financial assurance as specified in this section, will constitute a significant violation of these regulations warranting such remedy as the Regional Administrator deems necessary. Such violation will be deemed to begin upon receipt by the Regional Administrator of a notice of future cancellation, termination, or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the premium, rather than upon the date of expiration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each policy must contain a provision allowing assignment of the policy to a successor owner or operator. Such assignment may be conditional upon consent of the insurer, provided such consent is not unreasonably refused.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The policy must provide that the insurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy except for failure to pay the premium. The automatic renewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insured with the option of renewal at the face amount of the expiring policy. If there is a failure to pay the premium, the insurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the policy by sending notice by certified mail to the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning with the date of receipt of the notice by both the Regional Administrator and the owner or operator, as evidenced by the return receipts. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur and the policy will remain in full force and effect in the event that on or before the date of expiration:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Regional Administrator deems the facility abandoned; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditional exclusion or interim status is lost, terminated, or revoked; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Closure is ordered by the Regional Administrator or a U.S. district court or other court of competent jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The owner or operator is named as debtor in a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The premium due is paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Whenever the current cost estimate increases to an amount greater than the face amount of the policy, the owner or operator, within 60 days after the increase, must either cause the

face amount to be increased to an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate and submit evidence of such increase to the Regional Administrator, or obtain other financial assurance as specified in this section to cover the increase. Whenever the current cost estimate decreases, the face amount may be reduced to the amount of the current cost estimate following written approval by the Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The Regional Administrator will give written consent to the owner or operator that he may terminate the insurance policy when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Financial test and corporate guarantee.

The phrase ``current plugging and abandonment cost estimates'' as used in paragraph (e)(1) of this section refers to the cost estimates required to be shown in paragraphs 1-4 of the letter from the owner's or operator's chief financial officer (Sec. 144.70(f) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> To demonstrate that he meets this test, the owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer and worded as specified in Sec. 261.151(e); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the independent certified public accountant's report on examination of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the chief financial officer's letter providing evidence of financial assurance includes financial data showing that the owner or operator satisfies paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that are different from the data in the audited financial statements referred to in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)of this section or any other audited financial statement or data filed with the SEC, then a special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator is required. The special report shall be based upon an agreed upon procedures engagement in accordance with professional auditing standards and shall describe the procedures performed in

comparing the data in the chief financial officer's letter derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements, the findings of the comparison, and the reasons for any differences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator may obtain an extension of the time allowed for submission of the documents specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section if the fiscal year of the owner or operator ends during the 90 days prior to the effective date of these regulations and if the year-end financial statements for that fiscal year will be audited by an independent certified public accountant. The extension will end no later than 90 days after the end of the owner's or operator's fiscal year. To obtain the extension, the owner's or operator's chief financial officer must send, by the effective date of these regulations, a letter to the Regional Administrator of each Region in which the owner's or operator's facilities to be covered by the financial test are located. This letter from the chief financial officer must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Request the extension;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certify that he has grounds to believe that the owner or operator meets the criteria of the financial test;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Specify for each facility to be covered by the test the EPA Identification Number (if any issued), name, address, and current cost estimates to be covered by the test;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Specify the date ending the owner's or operator's last complete fiscal year before the effective date of these regulations in this subpart;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Specify the date, no later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal year, when he will submit the documents specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certify that the year-end financial statements of the owner or operator for such fiscal year will be audited by an independent certified public accountant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year.

An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Regional Administrator will evaluate other qualifications on an individual basis. The owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section within 30 days after notification of the disallowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the

The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section and must comply with the terms of the guarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in Sec. 261.151(g)(1). A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this ``substantial business relationship'' and the value received in consideration of the guarantee. The terms of the guarantee must provide that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Following a determination by the Regional Administrator that the hazardous secondary materials at the owner or operator's facility covered by this guarantee do not meet the conditions of the exclusion under Sec. 261.4(a)(24) of this chapter, the guarantor will dispose of any hazardous secondary material as hazardous waste and close the facility in accordance with closure requirements found in parts 264 or 265 of this chapter, as applicable, or establish a trust fund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the name of the owner or operator in the amount of the current cost estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The corporate guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator.

An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing more than one financial mechanism per facility. These mechanisms are limited to trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, and insurance. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, respectively, of this section, except that it is the combination of mechanisms, rather than the single mechanism, which must provide financial assurance for an amount at least equal to the current cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, he may use the trust fund as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust fund may be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator may use a financial assurance mechanism specified in this section to meet the requirements of this section for more than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the Regional Administrator must include a list showing, for each facility, the EPA Identification Number (if any issued), name, address, and the amount of funds assured by the mechanism. If the facilities covered by the mechanism are in more than one Region, identical evidence of financial assurance must be submitted to and maintained with the

Regional Administrators of all such Regions. The amount of funds available through the mechanism must be no less than the sum of funds that would be available if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each facility. In directing funds available through the mechanism for any of the facilities covered by the mechanism, the Regional Administrator may direct only the amount of funds designated for that facility, unless the owner or operator agrees to the use of additional funds available under the mechanism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Removal and Decontamination Plan for Release (1) An owner or operator of a reclamation facility or an intermediate facility who wishes to be released from his financial assurance obligations under Sec. 261.4(a)(24)(vi)(F) of this chapter must submit a plan for removing all hazardous secondary material residues to the Regional Administrator at least 180 days prior to the date on which he expects to cease to operate under the exclusion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The plan must include, at least:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For each hazardous secondary materials storage unit subject to financial assurance requirements under Sec. 261.4(a)(24)(vi)(F), a description of how all excluded hazardous secondary materials will be recycled or sent for recycling, and how all residues, contaminated containment systems (liners, etc), contaminated soils, subsoils, structures, and equipment will be removed or decontaminated as necessary to protect human health and the environment, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A detailed description of the steps necessary to remove or decontaminate all hazardous secondary material residues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures, and soils including, but not limited to, procedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination necessary to protect human health and the environment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A detailed description of any other activities necessary to protect human health and the environment during this timeframe, including, but not limited to, leachate collection, run-on and run-off control, etc; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A schedule for conducting the activities described which, at a minimum, includes the total time required to remove all excluded hazardous secondary materials for recycling and decontaminate all units subject to financial assurance under Sec. 261.4(a)(24)(vi)(F) and the time required for intervening activities which will allow tracking of the progress of decontamination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Regional Administrator will provide the owner or operator and the public, through a newspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the plan and request modifications to the plan no later than 30 days from the date of the notice. He will also, in response to a request or at his discretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the plan. The Regional Administrator will give public notice of the hearing at least 30 days before it occurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to submit written comments, and the two notices may be combined.) The Regional Administrator will approve, modify, or disapprove the plan within 90 days of its receipt. If the Regional Administrator does not approve the plan, he shall provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of reasons for the refusal and the owner or operator must modify the plan or submit a new plan for approval within 30 days after receiving such written statement. The Regional Administrator will approve or modify this plan in writing within 60 days. If the Regional Administrator modifies the plan, this modified plan becomes the approved plan. The Regional Administrator must assure that the approved plan is consistent with paragraph (h) of this section. A copy of the modified plan with a detailed statement of reasons for the modifications must be mailed to the owner or operator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Within 60 days of completion of the activities described for each hazardous secondary materials management unit, the owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator, by registered mail, a certification that

all hazardous secondary materials have been removed from the unit and the unit has been decontaminated in accordance with the specifications in the approved plan. The certification must be signed by the owner or operator and by a qualified Professional Engineer. Documentation supporting the Professional Engineer's certification must be furnished to the Regional Administrator, upon request, until he releases the owner or operator from the financial assurance requirements for Sec. 261.4(a)(24)(vi)(F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section. Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and a qualified Professional Engineer that all hazardous secondary materials have been removed from the facility or a unit at the facility and the facility or a unit has been decontaminated in accordance with the approved plan per paragraph (h), the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required under Sec. 261.4(a)(24)(vi)(F) to maintain financial assurance for that facility or a unit at the facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that all hazardous secondary materials have not been removed from the facility or unit at a facility or that the facility or unit has not been decontaminated in accordance with the approved plan. The Regional Administrator shall provide the owner or operator a detailed written statement of any such reason to believe that all hazardous secondary materials have not been removed from the unit or that the unit has not been decontaminated in accordance with the approved plan.
