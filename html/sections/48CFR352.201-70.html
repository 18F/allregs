No plan, questionnaire, interview guide or other similar device for collecting information (whether repetitive or single time) may be used without the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) first providing clearance. Contractors and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative shall be guided by the provisions of 5 CFR Part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public, and seek the advice of the HHS operating division or Office of the Secretary Reports Clearance Officer to determine the procedures for acquiring OMB clearance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall not expend any funds or begin any data collection until OMB Clearance is received. Once OMB Clearance is received from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with written notification authorizing the expenditure of funds and the collection of data. The Contractor shall allow at least 120 days for OMB clearance. The Contracting Officer will consider excessive delays caused by the Government which arise out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor in accordance with the Excusable Delays or Default clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
