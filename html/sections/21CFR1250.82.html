All potable water tanks shall  be independent of the shell of the ship unless (1) the bottom of the  tank is at least 2 feet above the maximum load water line, (2) the seams  in the shell are continuously welded, and (3) there are no rivets in  that part of the shell which forms a side of a tank. A deck may be used  as the top of a tank provided there are no access or inspection openings  or rivets therein, and the seams are continuously welded. No toilet or  urinal shall be installed immediately above that part of the deck which  forms the top of a tank. All potable water tanks shall be located at a  sufficient height above the bilge to allow for draining and to prevent  submergence in bilge water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each potable water tank shall be provided with a means of  drainage and, if it is equipped with a manhole, overflow, vent, or a  device for measuring depth of water, provision shall be made to prevent  entrance into the tank of any contaminating substance. No deck or  sanitary drain or pipe carrying any nonpotable water or liquid shall be  permitted to pass through the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tanks and piping shall bear clear marks of identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There shall be no backflow or cross connection between potable  water systems and any other systems. Pipes and fittings conveying  potable water to any fixture, apparatus, or equipment shall be installed  in such way that backflow will be prevented. Waste pipes from any part  of the potable water system, including treatment devices, discharging to  a drain, shall be suitably protected against backflow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Water systems shall be cleaned, disinfected, and flushed  whenever the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall find such treatment  necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of  communicable diseases.
