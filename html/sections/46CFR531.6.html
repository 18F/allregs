An NVOCC party which enters into an NSA that includes affiliates must either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> list the affiliates' business addresses; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> certify that this information will be provided to the Commission upon request within ten (10) business days of such request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> A description of the shipment records which will be maintained to support the NSA and the address, telephone number, and title of the person who will respond to a request by making shipment records available to the Commission for inspection under Sec. 531.12 of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> All other provisions of the NSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Certainty of terms. The terms described in paragraph (b) of this section may not:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be uncertain, vague or ambiguous; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Make reference to terms not explicitly contained in the NSA itself unless those terms are readily available to the parties and the Commission. Reference may not be made to a tariff of a common carrier other than the NVOCC acting as carrier party to the NSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to Sec. 531.12(b), the carrier party to the NSA must, upon written request by the Commission, provide the Commission with the associated records of the referenced terms. For the purpose of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the referenced terms will be deemed readily available to the Commission if the carrier party to the NSA provides the Commission with the associated records of the terms within thirty (30) days of the Commission's written request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Other requirements. (1) For service pursuant to an NSA, no NVOCC may, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly, provide service in the liner trade that is not in accordance with the rates, charges, classifications, rules and practices contained in a filed NSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For service pursuant to an NSA, no NVOCC, may, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly, engage in any unfair or unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of rates or charges with respect to any port; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For service under an NSA, no NVOCC may, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly, give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to any port.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No NVOCC may knowingly and willfully enter into an NSA with an ocean transportation intermediary that does not have a tariff and a bond, insurance, or other surety as required by sections 8 (46 U.S.C. 40501-40503) and 19 (46 U.S.C. 40901-40904) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Format requirements.

(1) In the event that the Commission's electronic filing system is not functioning and cannot receive NSAs filings for twenty-four (24) continuous hours or more, affected parties will not be subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and Sec. 531.11 that an NSA be filed before cargo is shipped under it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> However, NSAs which go into effect before they are filed due to a malfunction of the Commission's electronic filing system pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must be filed within twenty-four (24) hours of the Commission's electronic filing system's return to service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For an NSA that is effective without filing due to a malfunction of the Commission's filing system, failure to file that NSA within twenty-four (24) hours of the Commission's electronic filing system's return to service will be considered a violation of these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall result in the application of the terms of the otherwise applicable tariff.
