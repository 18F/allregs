                            <p class="depth0">Filters for liquid filtration used in the manufacture, processing,  or packing of injectable drug products intended for human use shall not  release fibers into such products. Fiber-releasing filters may be used  when it is not possible to manufacture such products without the use of  these filters. If use of a fiber-releasing filter is necessary, an  additional nonfiber-releasing filter having a maximum nominal pore size  rating of 0.2 micron (0.45 micron if the manufacturing conditions so  dictate) shall subsequently be used to reduce the content of particles  in the injectable drug product. The use of an asbestos-containing filter  is prohibited.  [73 FR 51932, Sept. 8, 2008]    Subpart E_Control of Components and Drug Product Containers and Closures</p>
