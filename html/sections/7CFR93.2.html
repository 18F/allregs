                            <p class="depth0">Words used in the regulations in this subpart in the singular form  will import the plural, and vice versa, as the case may demand. As used  throughout the regulations in this subpart, unless the context requires  otherwise, the following terms will be construed to mean:</p><p class="depth0">Acid. The grams of total acidity, calculated as anhydrous citric  acid, per 100 grams of juice or citrus product. Total acidity is  determined by titration with standard sodium hydroxide solution, using  phenolphthalein as indicator.</p><p class="depth0">Brix or degrees Brix. The percent by weight concentration of the  total soluble solids of the juice or citrus product when tested with a  Brix hydrometer calibrated at 20 C (68 F) and to which any applicable  temperature correction has been made. The Brix or degrees Brix may be  determined by any other method which gives equivalent results.</p><p class="depth0">Brix value. The pure sucrose or soluble solids value of the juice or  citrus product determined by using the refractometer along with the  ``International Scale of Refractive Indices of Sucrose Solutions'' and  to which the applicable correction for acidity is added. The Brix value  is determined in accordance with the refractometer   method outlined in the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC  INTERNATIONAL, Volumes I & II.</p><p class="depth0">Brix value/acid ratio. The ratio of the Brix value of the juice or  citrus product, in degrees Brix, to the grams of anhydrous citric acid  per 100 grams of juice or citrus product.</p><p class="depth0">Brix/acid ratio. The ratio of the degrees Brix of the juice to the  grams of anhydrous citric acid per 100 grams of the juice.</p><p class="depth0">Citrus. All plants, edible parts and commodity products thereof,  including pulp and juice of any orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit,  mandarin, tangerine, kumquat or other tree or shrub in the genera  Citrus, Fortunella, or Poncirus of the plant family Rutaceae.</p><p class="depth0">Recoverable oil. The percent of oil by volume, determined by the  bromate titration method after distillation and acidification as  described in the current edition of the Official Methods of Analysis of  AOAC INTERNATIONAL, Volumes I & II.  [61 FR 51351, Oct. 2, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 64316, Oct. 26, 2000]</p>
