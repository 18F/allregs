(i) The NEP Area for these 17 mollusks is within the  species' historic ranges, and is defined as follows: The free-flowing  reach of the Tennessee River from the base of Wilson Dam downstream to  the backwaters of Pickwick Reservoir (river mile (RM) 259.4 [414.0 km]  to RM 246.0 [393.6 km] and includes the lower 5 RM (8 km) of all  tributaries to this reach in Colbert and Lauderdale Counties, Alabama.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> None of the identified species are known to exist in any of the  tributaries to the free-flowing reach of the Tennessee River below  Wilson Dam or from below the backwaters of Pickwick Reservoir, Colbert  and Lauderdale Counties, Alabama. In the future, if any of the 17  mollusks are found upstream of the lower 5 RM (8 km) of these  tributaries or downstream into Pickwick Reservoir, we will presume the  animals came from the reintroduced NEP, and we will amend this rule and  enlarge the boundaries of the NEP Area to include the entire range of  the expanded population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> We do not intend to change the NEP designations to ``essential  experimental,'' ``threatened,'' or ``endangered'' within the NEP Area.
