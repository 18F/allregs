                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the FFD program follows split-specimen procedures, as  described in Sec. 26.113, the licensee testing facility shall analyze  aliquots of the specimen for the licensee's or other entity's purposes  as described in this part. Except as provided in paragraph (b) in this  section, the licensee testing facility shall store Bottles A and B of  the specimen in a secure manner until the facility has finished testing.  If the initial validity and drug test results are negative and the  specimen in Bottle A will not be forwarded to the HHS-certified  laboratory, the licensee testing facility may discard both Bottle A and  Bottle B. If any test results are positive or indicate that the specimen  is of questionable validity, the licensee testing facility shall forward  Bottle A to the HHS-certified laboratory for testing and shall retain  Bottle B in secure storage, under the requirements of Sec. 26.159(i),  or may forward it to the HHS-certified laboratory for storage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the MRO confirms that the specimen in Bottle A is positive,  adulterated, substituted, or invalid and the donor does not request that  Bottle B be tested, the licensee or other entity shall ensure that  Bottle B is maintained in long-term frozen storage (-20 [deg]C (- 4[emsp14] [deg]F) or less) for a minimum of 1 year. If a licensee  testing facility elects to retain the specimen in Bottle B, rather than  forwarding it to the HHS-certified laboratory with Bottle A, the  licensee testing facility shall ensure proper storage conditions in the  event of a prolonged power failure. After the end of 1 year, the  licensee or other entity may discard Bottle B, with the exception that  the licensee testing facility shall retain any specimens under legal  challenge, or as requested by the NRC, until the specimen is no longer  needed.
