                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Although the Government is not ordinarily concerned  with the contractor's insurance coverage if the contract is a fixed- price contract, in special circumstances agencies may specify insurance  requirements under fixed-price contracts. Examples of such circumstances  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor is--or has a separate operation--engaged  principally in Government work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Government property is involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The work is to be performed on a Government installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Government elects to assume risks for which the contractor  ordinarily obtains commercial insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Work on a Government installation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the clause at  52.228-5, Insurance--Work on a Government Installation, is required to  be included in a fixed-price contract by 28.310, the coverage specified  in 28.307 is the minimum insurance required and shall be included in the  contract Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The contracting officer  may require additional coverage and higher limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the clause at 52.228-5, Insurance--Work on a Government  Installation, is not required by 28.310 but is included because the  contracting officer considers it to be in the Government's interest to  do so, any of the types of insurance specified in 28.307 may be omitted  or the limits may be lowered, if appropriate.</p>
