                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to all helicopters in the primary, normal, transport, and restricted categories for which an acoustical change approval is applied for under Sec. 21.93(b) of this chapter on or after March 6, 1986. Compliance with the requirements of this section must be demonstrated under appendix H of this part, or, for helicopters having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more than 7,000 pounds, compliance with this section may be demonstrated under appendix J of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Except as otherwise provided, for helicopters covered by this section, the acoustical change approval requirements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In showing compliance with the requirements of appendix H of this part, noise levels must be measured, evaluated, and calculated in accordance with the applicable procedures and conditions prescribed in parts B and C of appendix H of this part. For helicopters having a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more than 7,000 pounds that alternatively demonstrate compliance under appendix J of this part, the flyover noise level prescribed in appendix J of this part must be measured, evaluated, and calculated in accordance with the applicable procedures and conditions prescribed in

parts B and C of appendix J of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with the noise limits prescribed in section H36.305 of appendix H of this part must be shown in accordance with the applicable provisions of part D of appendix H of this part. For those helicopters that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of appendix J of this part, compliance with the noise levels prescribed in section J36.305 of appendix J of this part must be shown in accordance with the applicable provisions of part D of appendix J of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stage 1 helicopters. Except as provided in Sec. 36.805(c), for each Stage 1 helicopter prior to a change in type design, the helicopter noise levels may not, after a change in type design, exceed the noise levels specified in section H36.305(a)(1) of appendix H of this part where the demonstration of compliance is under appendix H of this part. The tradeoff provisions under section H36.305(b) of appendix H of this part may not be used to increase any Stage 1 noise level beyond these limits. If an applicant chooses to demonstrate compliance under appendix J of this part, for each Stage 1 helicopter prior to a change in type design, the helicopter noise levels may not, after a change in type design, exceed the Stage 2 noise levels specified in section J36.305(a) of appendix J of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Stage 2 helicopters. For each helicopter that is Stage 2 prior to a change in type design, after a change in type design the helicopter must either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remain a Stage 2 helicopter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comply with Stage 3 requirements and remain a Stage 3 helicopter thereafter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Stage 3 helicopters. For a helicopter that is a Stage 3 helicopter prior to a change in type design, the helicopter must remain a Stage 3 helicopter after a change in type design.
