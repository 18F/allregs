Neither CFC1 nor CFC2  has liabilities to unrelated persons at the end of Year 1. USP owns  plant and equipment valued at $500, CFC1 owns plant and equipmen t  valued at $400, and CFC2 owns plant and equipment valued at $250. The  value of these assets has been determined using generally accepted  valuation techniques, as required by Sec. 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii).

In 2000, a taxpayer purchases and places in service  section 168 property used solely in the United States. In 2005, the  taxpayer elects to use the alternative tax book value method, effective  for the current taxable year. For purposes of determining the tax book  value of its section 168 property, the taxpayer's depreciation deduction  is determined by applying the method, convention, and recovery period  rules of the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g)(2) as  in effect in 2005 to the taxpayer's original cost basis in such  property. In 2006, the taxpayer acquires and places in service   in the United States new section 168 property. The tax book value of  this section 168 property is determined under the rules of section  168(g)(2) applicable to property placed in service in 2006.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the  taxpayer revokes the alternative tax book value method election  effective for taxable year 2010. Additionally, in 2011, the taxpayer  acquires new section 168 property and places it in service in the United  States. If the taxpayer elects to use the alternative tax book value  method effective for taxable year 2012, the taxpayer must determine the  tax book value of its section 168 property as though the prior election  still applied. Thus, the tax book value of property placed in service  prior to 2005 would be determined by applying the method, convention,  and recovery period rules of the alternative depreciation system under  section 168(g)(2) applicable to property placed in service in 2005. The  tax book value of section 168 property placed in service during any  taxable year after 2004 would be determined by applying the method,  convention, and recovery period rules of the alternative depreciation  system under section 168(g)(2) applicable to property placed in service  in such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> shall apply  to all members of an affiliated group of corporations as defined in  Sec.

Any expense that is deductible under section 163  (including original issue discount) constitutes interest expense for  purposes of this section, as well as for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.861- 10T, 1.861-11T, 1.861-12T, and 1.861-13T. The term interest refers to  the gross amount of interest expense incurred by a taxpayer in a given  tax year. The method of allocation and apportionment for interest set  forth in this section is based on the approach that, in general, money  is fungible and that interest expense is attributable to all activities  and property regardless of any specific purpose for incurring an  obligation on which interest is paid. Exceptions to the fungibility rule  are set forth in Sec. 1.861-10T. The fungibility approach recognizes  that all activities and property require funds and that management has a  great deal of flexibility as to the source and use of funds. When  borrowing will generally free other funds for other purposes, and it is  reasonable under this approach to attribute part of the cost of  borrowing to such other purposes. Consistent with the principles of  fungibility, except as otherwise provided, the aggregate of deductions  for interest in all cases shall be considered related to all income  producing activities and assets of the taxpayer and, thus, allocable to  all the gross income which the assets of the taxpayer generate, have  generated, or could reasonably have been expected to generate. In the  case of the interest expense of members of an affiliated group, interest  expense shall be considered to be allocable to all gross income of the  members of the group under Sec. 1.861-11T. That section requires the  members of an affiliated group to allocate and apportion the interest  expense of each member of the group as if all members of such group were  a single corporation. For the method of determining the interest  deduction allowed to foreign corporations under section 882(c), see  Sec. 1.882-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Interest equivalents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certain expenses and losses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. Any expense or loss (to the extent deductible) incurred in  a transaction or series of integrated or related transactions in which  the taxpayer secures the use of funds for a period of time shall be  subject to allocation and apportionment under the rules of this section  if such expense or loss is substantially incurred in consideration of  the time value of money. However, the allocation and apportionment of a  loss under this paragraph (b) shall not affect the characterization of  such loss as capital or ordinary for other purposes of the Code and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The rule of this paragraph (b)(1) may be illustrated  by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. W, a domestic corporation, borrows from X two ounces of  gold at a time when the spot price for gold is $500 per ounce. W agrees  to return the two ounces of gold in six months. W sells the two ounces  of gold to Y for $1000. W then enters into a contract with Z to purchase  two ounces of gold six months in the future for $1,050. In exchange for  the use of $1,000 in cash, W has sustained a loss of $50 on related  transactions. This loss is subject to allocation and apportionment under  the rules of this section in the same manner as interest expense.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X, a domestic corporation with a dollar functional  currency, borrows 100 pounds on January 1, 1987 for a three-year term at  an interest rate greater than the applicable federal rate for dollar  loans. At this time, the interest rate on the pound was approximately  equal to the interest rate on dollar borrowings and the forward price on  the pound, vis-a-vis the dollar, was approximately equal to the spot  price. On January 1, 1987, X converted 100 pounds into dollars and  entered into a currency swap that substantially hedged X's foreign  currency exposure on the pound borrowing, both with respect to interest  and principal. The borrowing, coupled with the swap, represents a series  of related transactions in which the taxpayer secures the use of funds  in its functional currency. Any net foreign currency loss on this series  of transactions constitutes a loss incurred substantially in  consideration of the time value of money and shall be apportioned in the  same manner as interest expense. Thus, if the pound depreciates against  the dollar, such that when the first payment on the pound borrowing is  due the taxpayer has a currency loss on the swap payment hedging its  first interest payment, such loss shall, even if the transaction is not  integrated under section 988(d), be allocated and apportioned in the  same manner as interest expense under the authority of this paragraph  (b)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On January 1, 1987, X, a domestic corporation with a  dollar functional currency, enters into a dollar interest rate swap   contract with Y, a domestic counterparty. Under the terms of this  agreement, X agrees to pay Y floating rate interest with respect to a  notional principal amount of $100 for five years. In return, Y agrees to  pay X fixed rate interest at 10 percent with respect to a notional  principal amount of $100 for five years. On the same day, Y prepays the  fixed leg of the swap by making a lump sum payment of $37 to X. This  lump sum payment represents the present value of five $10 swap payments.  Because X secures the use of $37 in this transaction, any net swap  expense arising from the transaction represents an expense incurred  substantially in consideration of the time value of money. Assuming this  lump sum payment is not otherwise characterized as a loan from Y to X,  and that X must amortize the $37 lump sum payment under the principles  of Notice 89-21, any net swap expense incurred by X with respect to this  transaction (i.e., the excess, if any, of X's annual swap payment to Y  over the annual amortization of the $37 lump sum payment that is taken  into income by X) represents an expense equivalent to interest expense.  The result would be the same if X sold the fixed leg to a third party  for $37. While this example presents the case of a lump sum payment, the  rules of paragraph (b)(1) would also apply to any transaction in which  the swap payments are not substantially contemporaneous if the pricing  of the transaction is materially affected by the time value of money.  Thus, expenses and losses will be subject to apportionment under the  rules of this section to the extent that such expenses or losses were  incurred in consideration of the time value of money.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain foreign currency borrowings--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. If a taxpayer  borrows in a nonfunctional currency at a rate of interest that is less  than the applicable federal rate (or its equivalent in functional  currency if the functional currency is not the dollar), any swap,  forward, future, option, or similar financial arrangement (or any  combination thereof) entered into by the taxpayer or by a related person  (as defined in Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2)) that exists during the term of the  borrowing and that substantially diminishes currency risk with respect  to the borrowing or interest expense thereon will be presumed to  constitute a hedge of such borrowing, unless the taxpayer can  demonstrate on the basis of facts and circumstances that the two  transactions are in fact unrelated. Under this presumption, the currency  loss incurred on the borrowing during taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1988, in connection with hedged nonfunctional currency  borrowings, reduced or increased by the gain or loss on the hedge, will  be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense. This presumption  can be rebutted by a showing that the financial arrangement was entered  into in connection with hedging currency exposure arising in the  ordinary course of a trade or business (other than with respect to the  borrowing).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) may be  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer has a dollar functional currency and does not  have any qualified business units with a functional currency other than  the dollar. On January 1, 1989, when the unit of foreign currency is  worth $1, taxpayer borrows 100 units of foreign currency for a three- year period bearing interest at the annual rate of 3 percent and  immediately converts the proceeds of the borrowing into dollars for use  in its business. In the ordinary course of its business, taxpayer has no  foreign currency exposure in this currency. In March 1989, taxpayer  enters into a three-year swap agreement that covers most, but not all,  of the payment of interest and principal. Because the swap substantially  diminishes currency risk with respect to the borrowing, it is presumed  to hedge the loan. Since taxpayer cannot demonstrate that it was hedging  currency exposure arising in the ordinary course of its business (other  than currency exposure with respect to the borrowing), the net currency  loss on the borrowing adjusted for any gain or loss on the swap must be  apportioned in the same manner as interest expense.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the  taxpayer borrows in two separate foreign currencies on terms described  in Example 1 and enters into a swap agreement in a single currency that  substantially diminishes the taxpayer's aggregate foreign currency risk.  The net currency loss on the borrowings adjusted for any gain or loss on  the swap must be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Losses on sale of certain receivables--(1) General rule. Any  loss on the sale of a trade receivable (as defined in Sec. 1.954-2(h))  shall be allocated and apportioned, solely for purposes of this section  and Sec. Sec. 1.861-10T, 1.861-11T, 1.861-12T, and 1.861-13T, in the  same manner as interest expense, unless at the time   of sale of the receivable, it bears interest at a rate which is at least  120 percent of the short term applicable federal rate (as determined  under section 1274(d) of the Code), or its equivalent in foreign  currency in the case of receivables denominated in foreign currency,  determined at the time the receivable arises. This treatment shall not  affect the characterization of such expense as interest for other  purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exceptions. To the extent that a loss on the sale of a trade  receivable exceeds the discount on the receivable that would be computed  applying to the amount received on the sale of the receivable 120  percent of the applicable federal rate (or its equivalent in foreign  currency in the case of receivables denominated in foreign currency) for  the period commencing with the date on which the receivable is sold and  ending with the earlier of the date on which the receivable begins to  bear interest at such rate or the anticipated payment date of the  receivable, such excess shall not be allocated and apportioned in the  same manner as interest expense but rather shall be allocated and  apportioned to the gross income generated by the receivable. In cases of  transfers of receivables to a domestic international sales corporation  described Sec. 1.994-1(c)(6)(v), the rule of this paragraph (b)(3)  shall not apply for purposes of computing combined taxable income. In  computing the combined taxable income of a foreign sales corporation and  its related supplier, loss on the sale of receivables to a third party  incurred either by the foreign sales corporation or its related supplier  shall offset combined taxable income, notwithstanding the provisions of  this paragraph (b)(3). See Sec. 1.924(a)-1T(g)(7).</p><p class="depth0">Example. On October 1, X sells a widget to Y for $100 payable in 30  days, after which the receivable will bear stated interest at 13  percent. On October 4, X sells Y's obligation to Z for $98. Assume that  the applicable federal rate for the month of October is 10 percent.  Applying 120 percent of the applicable federal rate to the $98 received  on the sale of the receivable, the obligation is discounted at a 12  percent rate for a period of 27 days. At this discount rate, the  obligation would have sold for $99.22. Thus, 88 cents of the $2 loss on  the sale is apportioned in the same manner as interest expense, and  $1.22 of the $2 loss on the sale is directly allocated to the income  generated on the widget sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rent in certain leasing transactions.

If a  bond or other debt obligation is issued at a premium, an amount of  interest expense incurred by the issuer on that bond or other debt  obligation equal to the amortized portion of that premium that is  included in gross income for the year shall be allocated and apportioned  solely to the amortized portion of premium derived by the issuer for the  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment by the holder. If a bond or debt obligation is  purchased at a premium, the portion of that premium amortized during the  year by the holder under section 171 and the regulations thereunder  shall be allocated and apportioned solely to interest income derived  from the bond by the holder for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Financial products that alter effective cost of borrowing--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. Various derivative financial products can be part of  transactions or series of transactions described in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section. Such derivative financial products, including interest  rate swaps, options, forwards, caps, and collars, potentially alter a  taxpayer's effective cost of borrowing with respect to an actual  liability of the taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer that is obligated to  pay interest at a fixed rate may, in effect, pay interest at a floating  rate by entering into an interest rate swap. Similarly, a taxpayer that  is obligated to pay interest at a floating rate may, in effect, limit  its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing a cap. Such a  taxpayer may have gains or losses associated with such derivative  financial products. This paragraph (b)(6) provides rules for the  treatment of gains and losses from such derivative financial products  (``financial products'') that are part of transactions described in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that are used by the taxpayer to  alter its effective cost of borrowing with respect to an actual  liability. This paragraph (b)(6) shall only apply where the hedge and  the borrowing are in the same currency and shall not apply to the extent  otherwise   provided in section 988 and the regulations thereunder. The allocation  and apportionment of a loss under this paragraph (b) shall not affect  the characterization of such loss as capital or ordinary for other  purposes of the Code and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of gain and loss. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(6), the term ``gain'' refers to the excess of the amounts properly  taken into income under a financial product that alters the effective  cost of borrowing over the amounts properly allowed as a deduction  thereunder within a given taxable year. See. e.g., Notice 89-21. The  term ``loss'' refers to the excess of the amounts properly allowed as a  deduction under such a financial product over the amounts properly taken  into income thereunder within a given taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of gain or loss on the disposition of a financial  product. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Entities that are not financial services entities. An entity  that does not constitute a financial services entity within the meaning  of Sec. 1.904-4(e)(3) shall treat gains and losses on financial  products described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section as follows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Losses. Losses on any financial product described in paragraph  (b)(6)(i) of this section shall be apportioned in the same manner as  interest expense whether or not such financial product is identified by  the taxpayer under paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C) of this section as a  liability hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gains. Gains on any financial product described in paragraph  (b)(6)(i) of this section shall reduce the taxpayer's total interest  expense that is subject to apportionment, but only if such financial  product is identified by the taxpayer under paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C) of  this section as a liability hedge. Such reduction is accomplished by  directly allocating interest expense to the income derived from such a  financial product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Identification of financial products. A taxpayer can identify a  financial product described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section as  hedging a particular interest-bearing liability (or any group of such  liabilities) by clearly identifying on its books and records on the same  day that it becomes a party to such arrangement that such arrangement  hedges a given liability (or group of liabilities). In the case of a  partial hedge, such identification shall apply to only that part of the  liability that is hedged. If the taxpayer clearly identifies on its  books and records a financial product as a hedge of an interest-bearing  asset (or any group of such assets), it will create a rebuttable  presumption that such financial product is not described in paragraph  (b)(6)(i) of this section. A taxpayer may identify a hedge as relating  to an anticipated liability, provided that such liability is in fact  incurred within 120 days following the date of such identification.  Gains and losses on such an anticipatory arrangement accruing prior to  the time at which the liability is incurred shall constitute an  adjustment to interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Financial services entities. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Dealers. The rule of paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section shall  not apply to a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer in the  financial products described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.  Instead, losses sustained by a regular dealer in connection with such  financial products shall be allocated to the class of gross income from  such arrangements. Gains of a regular dealer in notional principal  contracts are governed by the rules of Sec. 1.863-7T(b). Amounts  received or accrued by any person from any financial product that is  integrated as specified in Notice 89-90 with an asset shall not be  treated as amounts received or accrued by a person acting in its  capacity as a regular dealer in financial products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (b)(6) may be  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is not a financial services entity or regular dealer in  the financial products described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section  and has a dollar functional currency. In 1990, X incurred a total of  $200 of interest expense. On January 1, 1990, X entered into an interest  rate swap agreement with Y, in order to hedge its interest rate exposure  with respect to a pre-existing floating rate liability. On the same day,  X properly identified the agreement as a hedge of such liability. Under  the agreement, X is required to pay Y an amount equal to a fixed rate of  10   percent on a notional principal amount of $1,000. Y is required to pay X  an amount equal to a floating rate of interest on the same notional  principal amount. Under the agreement, X received from Y during 1990 a  net payment of $25. Because X identified the swap agreement as a  liability hedge under the rules of paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C), X may  effectively reduce its total allocable interest expense for 1990 to $175  by directly allocating $25 of interest expense to the swap income. Had X  not properly identified the swap as a liability hedge, this swap payment  would have been treated as domestic source income in accordance with the  rule of Sec. 1.863-7T(b).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example (1), except that X did  not properly identify the agreement as a liability hedge on January 1,  1990. In 1990, X made a net payment of $25 to Y under the swap  agreement. This swap payment is allocated and apportioned in the same  manner as interest expense under the rules of paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Foreign currency gain or loss. In addition to the rules of  paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) of this section, any foreign  currency loss that is treated as an adjustment to interest expense under  regulations issued under section 988 shall be allocated and apportioned  in the same manner as interest expense. Any foreign currency gain that  is treated as an adjustment to interest expense under regulations issued  under section 988 shall offset apportionable interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Allowable deductions. In order for an interest expense to be  allocated and apportioned, it must first be determined that the interest  expense is currently deductible. A number of provisions in the Code  disallow or suspend deductions of interest expense or require the  capitalization thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disallowed deductions. A taxpayer does not allocate and  apportion interest expense under this section that is permanently  disallowed as a deduction by operation of section 163(h), section 265,  or any other provision or rule that permanently disallows the deduction  of interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 263A. Section 263A requires the capitalization of  interest expense that is allocable to designated types of property. Any  interest expense that is capitalized under section 263A does not  constitute deductible interest expense for purposes of this section.  Furthermore, interest expense capitalized in inventory or depreciable  property is not separately allocated and apportioned when the inventory  is sold or depreciation is allowed. Capitalized interest expense is  effectively allocated and apportioned as part of, and in the same manner  as, the cost of goods sold, amortization, or depreciation deduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 163(d). Section 163(d) suspends the deduction for  interest expense to the extent that it exceeds net investment income. In  the year that suspended investment interest expense becomes allowable  under the rules of section 163(d), that interest expense is apportioned  under rules set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as though it  were incurred in the taxable year in which the expense is deducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 469--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Section 469 suspends the  deduction of passive activity losses to the extent that they exceed  passive activity income for the year. Passive activity losses may  consist in part of interest expense properly allocable to passive  activity. In the year that suspended interest expense becomes allowable  as a deduction under the rules of section 469, that interest expense is  apportioned under rules set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as  though it were incurred in the taxable year in which the expense is  deducted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification of the interest component of a suspended passive  loss. A suspended passive loss may consist of a variety of items of  expense other than interest expense. Suspended interest expense for any  taxable year is computed by multiplying the total suspended passive loss  for the year by a fraction, the numerator of which is passive interest  expense for the year (determined under regulations issued under section  163) and the denominator of which is total passive expenses for the  year. The amount of the suspended interest expense that is considered to  be deductible in a subsequent taxable year is computed by multiplying  the amount of any cumulative suspended interest expense (reduced by  suspended interest expense allowed as a deduction in prior taxable  years) times a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of  cumulative suspended passive losses that become deductible in the  taxable   year and the denominator of which is the cumulative suspended passive  losses for prior taxable years (reduced by suspended passive losses  allowed as deductions in prior taxable years).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (c)(4) may be illustrated  by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. On January 1, 1987, A, a United States citizen, invested in  a passive activity. In 1987, the passive activity generated no passive  income and $100 in passive losses, all of which were suspended by  operation of section 469. The suspended loss included $10 of suspended  interest expense. In 1988, the passive activity generated $50 in passive  income and $150 in passive expenses which included $30 of interest  expense. The entire $100 passive loss was suspended in 1988 and included  $20 of interest expense ($100 suspended passive loss x $30 passive  interest expense/$150 total passive expenses). Thus, at the end of 1988,  A had total suspended passive losses of $200, including $30 of suspended  interest expense. In 1989, the passive activity generated $100 in  passive income and no passive expenses. Thus, $100 of A's cumulative  suspended passive loss was therefore allowed in 1989. The $100 of  deductible passive loss includes $15 of suspended interest expense ($30  cumulative suspended interest expense x $100 of cumulative suspended  passive losses allowable in 1989/$200 of total cumulative suspended  passive losses). The $15 of interest expense is apportioned under the  rules of paragraph (d) of this section as though it were incurred in  1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Apportionment rules for individuals, estates, and certain  trusts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> United States individuals. In the case of taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1986, individuals generally shall apportion  interest expense under different rules according to the type of interest  expense incurred. The interest expense of individuals shall be  characterized under the regulations issued under section 163. However,  in the case of an individual whose foreign source income (including  income that is excluded under section 911) does not exceed a gross  amount of $5,000, the apportionment of interest expense under this  section is not required. Such an individual's interest expense may be  allocated entirely to domestic source income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interest incurred in the conduct of a trade or business. An  individual who incurs business interest described in section  163(h)(2)(A) shall apportion such interest expense using an asset method  by reference to the individual's business assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Investment interest. An individual who incurs investment  interest described in section 163(h)(2)(B) shall apportion that interest  expense on the basis of the individual's investment assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Interest incurred in a passive activity. An individual who  incurs passive activity interest described in section 163(h)(2)(C) shall  apportion that interest expense on the basis of the individual's passive  activity assets. Individuals who receive a distributive share of  interest expense incurred in a partnership are subject to special rules  set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> but instead  under subdivisions (i) or (iii) of this paragraph (d)(1). To the extent  that personal interest described in section 163(h)(2) remains deductible  under transitional rules, individuals shall apportion such interest  expense in the same manner as qualified residence interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A is a resident individual taxpayer engaged in  the active conduct of a trade or business, which A operates as a sole  proprietor. A's business generates only domestic source income. A's  investment portfolio consists of several less than 10 percent stock  investments. Certain stocks in which A's adjusted basis is $40,000  generate domestic source income and other stocks in which A's adjusted  basis is $60,000 generate foreign source passive income. In addition, A  owns his personal residence, which is subject to a mortgage in the  amount of $100,000. All interest expense incurred with respect to A's   mortgage is qualified residence interest for purposes of section  163(h)(2)(D). A's other indebtedness consists of a bank loan in the  amount of $40,000. Under the regulations issued under section 163(h), it  is determined that the proceeds of the $40,000 loan were divided equally  between A's business and his investment portfolio. In 1987, the gross  income of A's business, before the apportionment of interest expense,  was $50,000. A's investment portfolio generated $4,000 in domestic  source income and $6,000 in foreign source passive income. All of A's  debt obligations bear interest at the annual rate of 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis of business interest. Under section 163(h) of the  Code, $2,000 of A's interest expense is attributable to his business.  Under the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(i), such interest must be  apportioned on the basis of the business assets. Applying the asset  method described in paragraph (g) of this section, it is determined that  all of A's business assets generate domestic income and, therefore,  constitute domestic assets. Thus, the $2,000 in interest expense on the  business loan is allocable to domestic source income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis of investment interest. Under section 163(h) of the  Code, $2,000 of A's interest expense is investment interest. Under the  rules of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, such interest must be  apportioned on the basis of investment assets. Applying the asset  method, A's investment assets consist of stock generating domestic  source income with an adjusted basis of $40,000 and stock generating  foreign source passive income with an adjusted basis of $60,000. Thus,  40 percent ($800) of A's investment interest is apportioned to domestic  source income and 60 percent ($1,200) of A's investment interest is  apportioned to foreign source passive income for purposes of section  904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> of this section on the basis of all of A's gross  income. A's gross income consists of $60,000, $54,000 of which is  domestic source and $6,000 of which is foreign source passive income.  Thus, $9,000 of A's qualified residence interest is apportioned to  domestic source income and $1,000 of A's qualified residence interest is  apportioned to foreign source passive income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Nonresident aliens--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. For taxable years  beginning on or after January 1, 1988, interest expense incurred by a  nonresident alien shall be considered to be connected with income  effectively connected with a United States trade or business only to the  extent that interest expense is incurred with respect to liabilities  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Are entered on the books and records of the United States trade  or business when incurred, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Are secured by assets that generate such effectively connected  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Limitations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Maximum debt capitalization. Interest expense  incurred by a nonresident alien is not considered to be connected with  effectively connected income to the extent that it is incurred with  respect to liabilities that exceed 80 percent of the gross assets of the  United States trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Collateralization by other assets. Interest expense on  indebtedness that is secured by specific assets (not including the  general credit of the nonresident alien) other than the assets of the  United States trade or business shall not be considered to be connected  with effectively connected income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Estates and trusts. Estates shall be treated in the same manner  as individuals. In the case of a trust that is beneficially owned by  individuals and is a complex trust, the trust shall be treated in the  same manner as individuals under the rules of paragraph (d) of this  section, except that no de minimis amount shall apply. In the case of a  trust that is beneficially owned by one or more corporations, the trust  shall be treated either as a partnership or as a corporation depending  on how the trust is characterized under the rules of section 7701 and  the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(4)</em>, a partner's distributive share of the  interest expense of a partnership that is not directly allocable under  Sec. 1.861-10T generally is considered related to all income producing  activities and assets of the partner and shall be subject to  apportionment under the rules described in this paragraph. For purposes  of this section, a   partner's percentage interest in a partnership shall be determined by  reference to the partner's interest in partnership income for the year.  Similarly, a partner's pro rata share of partnership assets shall be  determined by reference to the partner's interest in partnership income  for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> through (e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Less than 10 percent limited partners and less than 10 percent  corporate general partners--entity rule--(i) Partnership interest  expense. A limited partner (whether individual or corporate) or  corporate general partner whose direct and indirect interest (as  determined under the attribution rules of section 318) in the  partnership is less than 10 percent shall directly allocate its  distributive share of partnership interest expense to its distributive  share of partnership gross income. Under Sec. 1.904-7(i)(2) of the  regulations, such a partner's distributive share of foreign source  income of the partnership is treated as passive income (subject to the  high taxed income exception of section 904(d)(2)(F)), except in the case  of high withholding tax interest or income from a partnership interest  held in the ordinary course of the partner's active trade or business,  as defined in Sec. 1.904-7(i)(2). A partner's distributive share of  partnership interest expense (other than partnership interest expense  that is directly allocated to identified property under Sec. 1.861-10T)  shall be apportioned in accordance with the partner's relative  distributive share of gross foreign source income in each limitation  category and of domestic source income from the partnership. To the  extent that partnership interest expense is directly allocated under  Sec. 1.861-10T, a comparable portion of the income to which such  interest expense is allocated shall be disregarded in determining the  partner's relative distributive share of gross foreign source income in  each limitation category and domestic source income. The partner's  distributive share of the interest expense of the partnership that is  directly allocable under Sec. 1.861-10T shall be allocated according to  the treatment, after application of Sec. 1.904-7</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)</em>, of the  partner's distributive share of the income to which the expense is  allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other interest expense of the partner. For purposes of  apportioning other interest expense of the partner on an asset basis,  the partner's interest in the partnership, and not the partner's pro  rata share of partnership assets, is considered to be the relevant  asset. The value of this asset for apportionment purposes is either the  tax book value or fair market value of the partner's partnership  interest, depending on the method of apportionment used by the taxpayer.  This amount of a partner's interest in the partnership is allocated  among various limitation categories in the same manner as partnership  interest expense (that is not directly allocable under Sec. 1.861-10T)  is apportioned in subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(4). If the  partner uses the tax book value method of apportionment, the partner's  interest in the partnership must be reduced, for this purpose, to the  extent that the partner's basis consists of liabilities that are taken  into account under section 752. Under either the tax book value or fair  market value method of apportionment, for purposes of this section only,  the value of the partner's interest in the partnership must be reduced  by the principal amount of any indebtedness of the partner the interest  on which is directly allocated to its partnership interest under Sec.  1.861-10T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tiered partnerships. If a partnership is a partner in another  partnership, the distributive share of interest expense of a lower-tier  partnership that is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(4) shall not  be reapportioned in the hands of any higher-tier partner. However, the  distributive share of interest expense of lower-tier partnership that is  subject to the rules of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) shall be apportioned by  the partner of the higher-tier partnership or by any higher-tier  partnership to which the rules of paragraph (e)(4) apply, taking into  account the partner's indirect pro rata share of the lower-tier  partnership's income or assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Example--(i) Facts. A, B, and C are partners in a limited  partnership. A is a corporate general partner, owns a 5 percent interest  in the partnership, and   has an adjusted basis in its partnership interest, determined without  regard to section 752 of the Code, of $5. A's investment in the  partnership is not held in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's active  trade or business, as defined in Sec. 1.904-7</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)</em>. B, a corporate  limited partner, owns a 70 percent interest in the partnership, and has  an adjusted basis in its partnership interest, determined without regard  to section 752 of the Code, of $70. C is an individual limited partner,  owns a 25 percent interest in the partnership, and has an adjusted basis  in the partnership interest, determined without regard to section 752 of  the Code, of $25. The partners' interests in the profits and losses of  the partnership conform to their respective interests. None of the  interest expense incurred directly by any of the partners is directly  allocable to their partnership interest under Sec. 1.861-10T. The ABC  partnership's sole assets are two apartment buildings, one domestic and  the other foreign. The domestic building has an adjusted inside basis of  $600 and the foreign building has an adjusted inside basis of $500. Each  of the buildings is subject to a nonrecourse liability in the amount of  $500. The ABC partnership's total interest expense for the taxable year  is $120, both nonrecourse liabilities bearing interest at the rate of 12  percent. The indebtedness on the domestic building qualifies for direct  allocation under the rules of Sec. 1.861-10T. The indebtedness on the  foreign building does not so qualify. The partnership incurred no  foreign taxes. The partnership's gross income for the taxable year is  $360, consisting of $100 in foreign source income and $260 in domestic  source income. Under Sec. 1.752-1(e), the nonrecourse liabilities of  the partnership are allocated among the partners according to their  share of the partnership profits. Accordingly, the adjusted basis of A,  B, and C in their respective partnership interests (for other than  apportionment purposes) is, respectively, $55, $770, and $275.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination of the amount of partnership interest expense  that is subject to allocation and apportionment. Interest on the  nonrecourse loan on the domestic building is, under Sec. 1.861-10T,  directly allocable to income from that investment. The interest expense  is therefore directly allocable to domestic income. Interest on the  nonrecourse loan on the foreign building is not directly allocable. The  interest expense is therefore subject to allocation and apportionment.  Thus, $60 of interest expense is directly allocable to domestic income  and $60 of interest expense is subject to allocation and apportionment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Analysis for Partner A. A's distributive share of the  partnership's gross income is $18, which consists of $5 in foreign  source income and $13 in domestic source income. A's distributive share  of the ABC interest expense is $6, $3 of which is directly allocable to  domestic income and $3 of which is subject to apportionment. After  direct allocation of qualifying interest expense, A's distributive share  of the partnership's gross income consists of $5 in foreign source  income and $10 in domestic source income. Because A is a less than 10  percent corporate partner, A's distributive share of any foreign source  partnership income is considered to be passive income. Accordingly, in  apportioning the $3 of partnership interest expense that is subject to  apportionment on a gross income method, one-third ($1) is apportioned to  foreign source passive income and two-thirds ($2) is apportioned to  domestic source income. In apportioning its other interest expense, A  uses the tax book value method. A's adjusted basis in A's partnership  interest ($55) includes A's share of the partnership's liabilities  ($50), which are included in basis under section 752. For purposes of  apportioning other interest expense, A's adjusted basis in the  partnership must be reduced to the extent of such liabilities. Thus, A's  adjusted basis in the partnership, for purposes of apportionment, is $5.  For the purpose of apportioning A's other interest expense, this $5 in  basis is characterized one-third as a foreign passive asset and two- thirds as a domestic asset, which is the ratio determined in paragraph  (e)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Analysis for Partner B. B's distributive share of the ABC  interest expense is $84, $42 of which is directly allocable to domestic  income and $42 of which is subject to apportionment. As   a corporate limited partner whose interest in the partnership is 10  percent or more, B is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) and  paragraph (f) of this section. These rules require that a corporate  partner apportion its distributive share of partnership interest expense  at the partner level on the asset method described in paragraph (g) of  this section by reference to its corporate assets, which include, for  this purpose, 70 percent of the partnership's assets, adjusted in the  manner described in Sec. 1.861-10T(e) to reflect directly allocable  interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Analysis for Partner C. C's distributive share of the ABC  interest expense is $30, $15 of which is directly allocable to domestic  income and $15 of which is subject to apportionment. As an individual  limited partner whose interest in the partnership is 10 percent or more,  C is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. These  rules require that an individual's share of partnership interest expense  be classified under regulations issued under section 163(h) and then  apportioned under the rules applicable to individuals, which are set  forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Foreign partners. The distributive share of partnership interest  expense of a nonresident alien who is a partner in a partnership shall  be considered to be connected with effectively connected income based on  the percentage of the assets of the partnership that generate  effectively connected income. No interest expense directly incurred by  the partner may be allocated and apportioned to effectively connected  income derived by the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Domestic corporations. Domestic corporations  shall apportion interest expense using the asset method described in  paragraph (g) of this section and the applicable rules of Sec. Sec.  1.861-10T through 1.861-13T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign branches of domestic corporations. In the application of  the asset method described in paragraph (g) of this section, a domestic  corporation shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Take into account the assets of any foreign branch, translated  according to the rules set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Combine with its own interest expense any deductible interest  expense incurred by a branch, translated according to the rules of  section 987 and the regulations thereunder.  For purposes of computing currency gain or loss on any remittance from a  branch or other qualified business unit (as defined in Sec. 1.989(a)- 1T) under section 987, the rules of this paragraph (f) shall not apply.  The branch shall compute its currency gain or loss on remittances by  taking into account only its separate expenses and its separate income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X is a domestic corporation which operates B, a  branch doing business in a foreign country. In 1988, without regard to  branch B, X has gross domestic source income of $1,000 and gross foreign  source general limitation income of $500 and incurs $200 of interest  expense. Using the tax book value method of apportionment, X, without  regard to branch B, determines the value of its assets that generate  domestic source income to be $6,000 and the value of its assets that  generate foreign source general limitation income to be $1,000. B  constitutes a qualified business unit within the meaning of section 989  with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar and uses the  profit and loss method prescribed by section 987. Applying the  translation rules of section 987, B earned $500 of gross foreign general  limitation income and incurred $100 of interest expense. B incurred no  other expenses. For 1988, the average functional currency book value of  B's assets that generate foreign general limitation income translated at  the year-end rate for 1988 is $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Computation of net income. The combined assets of X and B for  1988 (averaged under the rules of Sec. 1.861-9T(g)(3)) consist 60  percent of assets generating domestic source income and 40 percent of  assets generating foreign source general limitation income. The combined  interest expense of both X and B is $300. Thus, $180 of the combined  interest expense is apportioned to domestic source income and $120 is  apportioned to the foreign source income, yielding net domestic source  income of $820 and net foreign source general limitation income of $880.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Computation of currency gain or loss. For purposes of  computing currency gain or loss on branch remittances, B takes into  account only its gross income and its separate expenses. In 1988, B  therefore has a net amount of income in foreign currency units equal in  value to $400. Gain or loss on remittances shall be computed by  reference to this amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Controlled foreign corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of  computing subpart F income and computing earnings and profits for all  other federal tax purposes, the interest expense of a controlled foreign  corporation may be apportioned either using the asset method described  in paragraph (g) of this section or using the modified gross income  method described in paragraph (j) of this section, subject to the rules  of subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph (f)(2). However, the  gross income method described in paragraph (j) of this section is not  available to any controlled foreign corporation if a United States  shareholder and the members of its affiliated group (as defined in Sec.  1.861-11T(d)) constitute controlling shareholders of such controlled  foreign corporation and such affiliated group elects the fair market  value method of apportionment under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> to utilize a particular method of apportionment must do so  with respect to all United States shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Stock characterization. Pursuant to Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(2), the  stock of a controlled foreign corporation shall be characterized in the  hands of any United States shareholder using the same method that the  controlled foreign corporation uses to apportion its interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Noncontrolled section 902 corporations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  purposes of computing earnings and profits of a noncontrolled section  902 corporation (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E)) for federal tax  purposes, the interest expense of a noncontrolled section 902  corporation may be apportioned using either the asset method described  in paragraph (g) of this section or the modified gross income method  described in paragraph (j) of this section. A noncontrolled section 902  corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation may elect to  use a different method of apportionment than that elected by one or more  of its shareholders. For further guidance, see Sec. 1.861-9(f)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> at  the time and in the manner described therein and providing a written  notice described in Sec. 1.964-   1T(c)(3)(iii), except that no such statement or notice is required to be  filed or sent before July 24, 2006.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>, or in the hands of any shareholder that is not  eligible to compute an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect  to a dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation for the  taxable year. See Sec. 1.861-12T(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective date. This paragraph (f)(4) applies for taxable years  of shareholders ending after the first day of the first taxable year of  the noncontrolled section 902 corporation beginning after December 31,  2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Other relevant provisions. Affiliated groups of corporations are  subject to special rules set forth in Sec. 1.861-11T. Section 1.861-12T  sets forth rules relating to basis adjustments for stock in  nonaffiliated 10 percent owned corporations, special rules relating to  the consideration and characterization of certain assets in the  apportionment of interest expense, and to other special rules pertaining  to the apportionment of interest expense. Section 1.861-13T contains  transition rules limiting the application of the rules of Sec. Sec.  1.861-8T through 1.861-12T, which are otherwise applicable to taxable  years beginning after 1986. In the case of an affiliated group of  corporations as defined in Sec. 1.861-11T(d), any reference in  Sec. Sec. 1.861-8T through 1.861-13T to the ``taxpayer'' with respect  to the allocation and apportionment of interest expense generally  denotes the entire affiliated group of corporations and not the separate  members thereof, unless the context otherwise requires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Asset method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the asset method, the  taxpayer apportions interest expense to the various statutory groupings  based on the average total value of assets within each such grouping for  the taxable year, as determined under the asset valuation rules of this  paragraph (g)(1) and paragraph (g)(2) of this section and the asset  characterization rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section and Sec.  1.861-12T. Except to the extent otherwise provided (see, e.g., paragraph  (d)(1)(iv) of this section), taxpayers must apportion interest expense  only on the basis of asset values and may not apportion any interest  deduction on the basis of gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A taxpayer may elect to determine the value of its assets on  the basis of either the tax book value or the fair market value of its  assets. For rules concerning the application of an alternative method of  valuing assets for purposes of the tax book value method, see Sec.  1.861-9(i). For rules concerning the application of the fair market  value method, see paragraph (h) of this section. In the case of an  affiliated group--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The parent of which used the fair market value method prior to  1987, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A substantial portion of which used the fair market value method  prior to 1987, such a taxpayer may use either the fair market value  method or the tax book value method for its tax year commencing in 1987  and may use either such method in its tax year commencing in 1988  without regard to which method was used in its tax year commencing in  1987 and without securing the Commissioner's consent. The use of the  fair market value method in 1988, however, shall operate as a binding  election as described in Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2). For rules requiring  consistency in the use of the tax book value or fair market value  method, see Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A taxpayer electing to apportion its interest expense on the  basis of the fair market value of its assets must establish the fair  market value to the satisfaction of the Commissioner. If a taxpayer  fails to establish the fair market value of an asset to the satisfaction  of the Commissioner, the Commissioner may determine the appropriate   asset value. If a taxpayer fails to establish the value of a substantial  portion of its assets to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, the  Commissioner may require the taxpayer to use the tax book value method  of apportionment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For rules relating to earnings and profits adjustments by  taxpayers using the tax book value method for the stock in certain  nonaffiliated 10 percent owned corporations, see Sec. 1.861-12T(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The provisions of this paragraph (g)(1) may be illustrated by  the following examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X, a domestic corporation organized on January  1, 1987, has deductible interest expense in 1987 in the amount of  $150,000. X apportions its expenses according to the tax book value  method. The adjusted basis of X's assets is $3,600,000, $3,000,000 of  which generate domestic source income and $600,000 of which generate  foreign source general limitation income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation. No portion of the $150,000 deduction is directly  allocable solely to identified property within the meaning of Sec.  1.861-10T. Thus, X's deduction for interest is related to all its  activities and assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Apportionment. X apportions its interest expense as follows:</p><p class="depth0">To foreign source general limitation income:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.113</p><p class="depth0">To domestic source income:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.114</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except  that X apportions its interest expense on the basis of the fair market  value of its assets. X's total assets have a fair market value of  $4,000,000, $3,200,000 of which generate domestic source income and  $800,000 of which generate foreign source general limitation income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation. No portion of the $150,000 deduction is directly  allocable solely to identified property within the meaning of Sec.  1.861-10T. Thus, X's deduction for interest is related to all its  activities and properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Apportionment. If it establishes the fair market value of its  assets to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, X may apportion its  interest expense as follows:</p><p class="depth0">To foreign source general limitation income:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.115</p><p class="depth0">To domestic source income:</p><p class="depth0">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.116</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Asset values--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. For purposes of determining the  value of assets under this section, an average of values (book or  market) within each statutory grouping and the residual grouping shall  be computed for the year on the basis of values of assets at the  beginning and end of the year. For the first taxable year beginning  after 1986, a taxpayer may choose to determine asset values solely by  reference to the year-end value of its assets, provided that all the  members of an affiliated group as defined in Sec. 1.861-11T(d) make the  same choice. Thus, no averaging is required for the first taxable year  beginning after 1986. Where a substantial distortion of asset values  would result from averaging beginning-of-year and year-end values, as  might be the case in the event of a major corporate acquisition or  disposition, the taxpayer must use a different method of asset valuation  that more clearly reflects the average value of assets weighted to  reflect the time such assets are held by the taxpayer during the taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for qualified business units of domestic  corporations with functional currency other than the U.S. dollar--(A)  Tax book value method. In the case of taxpayers using the tax book value  method of apportionment, the following rules shall apply to determine  the value of the assets of a qualified business unit (as defined in  section 989(a)) of a domestic corporation with a functional currency  other than the dollar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Profit and loss branch. In the case of a branch for which an  election is not effective under Sec. 1.985-2T to use the dollar  approximate separate transactions method of computing currency gain or  loss, the tax book value shall be determined by applying the rules of  paragraph (g)(2)(i) and (3) of this section with respect to beginning- of-year and end-of-year tax book value in units of functional currency  that are translated   into dollars at the end-of-year exchange rate between the functional  currency and the U.S. dollar.</p><p class="depth0">Example. At the end of 1987, a profit and loss branch has assets  that generate foreign source general limitation income with a tax book  value in units of functional currency of 100. At the end of 1987, the  unit is worth $1. At the end of 1988, the branch has assets that  generate foreign source general limitation income with a tax book value  in units of functional currency of 80. At the end of 1988, the unit is  worth $2. The average value of foreign source general limitation assets  for 1988 is 90 units, which is worth $180.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Fair market value method. In the case of taxpayers using the  fair market value method of apportionment, the beginning-of-year and  end-of-year fair market values of branch assets within each grouping  shall be computed in dollars and averaged as provided in this paragraph  (g)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adjustment for directly allocated interest. Prior to  averaging, the year-end value of any asset to which interest expense is  directly allocated during the current taxable year under the rules of  Sec. 1.861-10T (b) or (c) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the  percentage of the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding at year- end equal to the percentage of all interest on the debt for the taxable  year that is directly allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assets in intercompany transactions. In the application of the  asset method described in this paragraph (g), the tax book value of  assets transferred between affiliated corporations in intercompany  transactions shall be determined without regard to the gain or loss that  is deferred under the regulations issued under section 1502.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Example. X is a domestic corporation that uses the fair market  value method of apportionment. X is a calendar year taxpayer. X owns 25  percent of the stock of A, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation. At  the end of 1987, the fair market value of X's assets by income grouping  are as follows:  Domestic......................................................$1,000,000 Foreign general limitation.......................................500,000 Foreign passive..................................................500,000 Noncontrolled section 902 corporation.............................50,000</p><p class="depth0">For its 1987 tax year, X apportions its interest expense by  reference to the 1987 year-end values. In July of 1988, X sells a  portion of its investment in A and in an asset acquisition purchases a  shipping business, the assets of which generate exclusively foreign  shipping income. At the end of 1988, the fair market values of X's  assets by income grouping are as follows:  Domestic........................................................$800,000 Foreign general limitation.......................................900,000 Foreign passive..................................................300,000 Noncontrolled section 902 corporation.............................40,000 Foreign shipping.................................................100,000</p><p class="depth0">For its 1988 tax year, X shall apportion its interest expense by  reference to the average of the 1988 beginning-of-year values (the 1987  year-end values) and the 1988 year-end values, assuming that the  averaging of beginning-of-year and end-of-year values does not cause a  substantial distortion of asset values. These averages are as follows:  Domestic........................................................$900,000 Foreign general limitation.......................................700,000 Foreign passive..................................................400,000 Foreign shipping..................................................50,000 Noncontrolled section 902 corporation.............................45,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Characterization of assets. Assets are charactrized for purposes  of this section according to the source and type of the income that they  generate, have generated, or may reasonably be expected to generate. The  physical location of assets is not relevant to this   determination. Subject to the special rules of paragraph (h) concerning  the application of the fair market value method of apportionment, the  value of assets within each statutory grouping and the residual grouping  at the beginning and end of each year shall be determined by dividing  the taxpayer's assets into three types--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Single category assets. Assets that generate income that is  exclusively within a single statutory grouping or the residual grouping;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple category assets. Assets that generate income within  more than one grouping of income (statutory or residual); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Assets without directly identifiable yield. Assets that  produce no directly identifiable income yield or that contribute equally  to the generation of all the income of the taxpayer (such as assets used  in general and administrative functions).  Single category assets are directly attributable to the relevant  statutory or residual grouping of income. In order to attribute multiple  category assets to the relevant groupings of income, the income yield of  each such asset for the taxable year must be analyzed to determine the  proportion of gross income generated by it within each relevant  grouping. The value of each asset is then prorated among the relevant  groupings of income according to their respective proportions of gross  income. The value of each asset without directly identifiable income  yield must be identified. However, because prorating the value of such  assets cannot alter the ratio of assets within the various groupings of  income (as determined by reference to the single and multiple category  assets), they are not taken into account in determining that ratio.  Special asset characterization rules that are set forth in Sec. 1.861- 12T. An example demonstrating the application of the asset method is set  forth in Sec. 1.861-12T(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The fair market value method. An affiliated group (as defined in  Sec. 1.861-11T(d)) or other taxpayer (the ``taxpayer'') that elects to  use the fair market value method of apportionment shall value its assets  according to the following methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination of values--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Valuation of group assets. The  taxpayer shall first determine the aggregate value of the assets of the  taxpayer on the last day of its taxable year without excluding the value  of stock in foreign subsidiaries or any other asset. In the case of a  publicly traded corporation, this determination shall be equal to the  aggregate trading value of the taxpayer's stock traded on established  securities markets at year-end increased by the taxpayer's year-end  liabilities to unrelated persons and its pro rata share of year-end  liabilities of all related persons owed to unrelated persons. In  determining whether persons are related, Sec. 1.861-8T(c)(2) shall  apply. In the case of a corporation that is not publicly traded, this  determination shall be made by reference to the capitalization of  corporate earnings, in accordance with the rules of Rev. Rul. 68-609. In  either case, control premium shall not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Valuation of tangible assets. The taxpayer shall determine the  value of all assets held by the taxpayer and its pro rata share of  assets held by other related persons on the last day of its taxable  year, excluding stock or indebtedness in such persons, any intangible  property as defined in section 936(h)(3)(B), or goodwill or going  concern value intangibles. Such valuations shall be made using generally  accepted valuation techniques. For this purpose, assets may be combined  into reasonable groupings. Statistical methods of valuation may only be  used in connection with fungible property, such as commodities. The  value of stock in any corporation that is not a related person shall be  determined under the rules of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section,  except that no liabilities shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Computation of intangible asset value. The value of the  intangible assets of the taxpayer and of intangible assets of all  related persons attributable to the taxpayer's ownership in related  persons is equal to the amount obtained by subtracting the amount  determined under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section from the amount  determined under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Apportionment of intangible asset value. The value of the  intangible assets determined under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section  is apportioned among the taxpayer and all related persons in proportion  to the net income before interest expense of the taxpayer and the  taxpayer's pro rata share of the net income before interest expense of  each ralated person held by the taxpayer, excluding income that is  passive under Sec. 1.904-4(b). For this purpose, net income is  determined before reduction for income taxes. Net income of the taxpayer  and of related persons shall be computed without regard to dividends or  interest received from any person that is related to the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Characterization of affiliated group's portion of intangible  asset value. The portion of the value of intangible assets of the  taxpayer and related persons that is apportioned to the taxpayer under  paragraph (h)(2) of this section is characterized on the basis of net  income before interest expense, as determined under paragraph (h)(2) of  this section, of the taxpayer within each statutory or residual grouping  of income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Adjustments for apportioning related person expenses. For  purposes of apportioning expenses of a related person, the value of  stock in a second related person as otherwise determined under paragraph  (h)(4) of this section (which is determined on the basis of the  taxpayer's percentage ownership interest in the second related person)  shall be increased to reflect the first related person's percentage  ownership interest in the second related person to the extent it is  larger.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that a taxpayer owns 80 percent of CFC1, which owns  100 percent of CFC2. The value of CFC1 is determined generally under  paragraph (h)(4) on the basis of the taxpayer's 80 percent indirect  interest in CFC2. For purposes of apportioning expenses of CFC1, 100  percent of the stock of CFC1 must be taken into account. Therefore, the  value of CFC2 stock in the hands of CFC1 shall equal the value of CFC2  stock in the hands of CFC1 as determined under paragraph (h)(4) of this  section, increased by 25 percent of such amount to reflect the fact that  CFC1 owns 100 percent and not 80 percent of CFC2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Modified gross income method. Subject to rules set forth in  paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the interest expense of a controlled  foreign corporation may be allocated according to the following rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Single-tier controlled foreign corporation. In the case of a  controlled foreign corporation that does not hold stock in any lower- tier controlled foreign corporation, the interest expense of the  controlled foreign corporation shall be apportioned based on its gross  income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Multiple vertically owned controlled foreign corporations. In  the case of a controlled foreign corporation that holds stock in any  lower-tier controlled foreign corporation, the interest expense of that  controlled foreign corporation and such upper-tier controlled foreign  corporation shall be apportioned based on the following methodology:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Step 1. Commencing with the lowest-tier controlled foreign  corporation in the chain, allocate and apportion its interest expense  based on its gross income as provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this  section, yielding gross income in each grouping net of interest expense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2. Moving to the next higher-tier controlled foreign  corporation, combine the gross income of such corporation within each  grouping with its pro rata share of the gross income net of interest  expense of all lower-tier controlled foreign corporations held by such  higher-tier corporation within the same grouping adjusted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Exclude from the gross income of the upper-tier corporation any  dividends or other payments received from the lower-tier corporation  other than interest subject to look-through under section 904(d)(3); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exclude from the gross income net of interest expense of any  lower-tier corporation any subpart F income (net of interest expense  apportioned to such income).  Then apportion the interest expense of the higher-tier controlled  foreign corporation based on the adjusted combined gross income amounts.  Repeat   this step 2 for each next higher-tier controlled foreign corporation in  the chain. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(2)(ii), pro rata share  shall be determined under principles similar to section 951(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em>.
