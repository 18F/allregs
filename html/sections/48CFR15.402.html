When obtaining data from the offeror is necessary, unless an exception under 15.403-1(b)(1) or (2) applies, such data submitted by the offeror shall include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Cost data to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine a fair and reasonable price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtain the type and quantity of data necessary to establish a fair and reasonable price, but not more data than is necessary. Requesting unnecessary data can lead to increased proposal preparation costs, generally extend acquisition lead time, and consume additional contractor and Government resources. Use techniques such as, but not limited to, price analysis, cost analysis, and/or cost realism analysis to establish a fair and reasonable price. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be established by the contracting officer from the analyses of the data obtained or submitted to date, the contracting officer shall require the submission of additional data sufficient for the contracting officer to support the determination of the fair and reasonable price.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Price each contract separately and independently and not--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use proposed price reductions under other contracts as an evaluation factor; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consider losses or profits realized or anticipated under other contracts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Not include in a contract price any amount for a specified contingency to the extent that the contract provides for a price adjustment based upon the occurrence of that contingency.
