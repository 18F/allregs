When these conditions are not present, allocations may be made by calculating a composite pension cost for two or more segments and allocating this cost to these segments by means of an allocation base.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When pension costs are separately computed for a segment or segments, the provisions of Cost Accounting

Standard 9904.412 regarding the assignable cost limitation shall be based on the actuarial value of assets, actuarial accrued liability and normal cost for the segment or segments for purposes of such computations.
