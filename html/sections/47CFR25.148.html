                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Due diligence. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All persons granted DBS authorizations shall  proceed with due diligence in constructing DBS systems. Permittees shall  be required to complete contracting for construction of the satellite  station(s) within one year of the grant of the authorization. The  satellite stations shall also be required to be in operation within six  years of the authorization grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the requirements stated in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section, all persons who receive new or additional DBS  authorizations after January 19, 1996 shall complete construction of the  first satellite in their respective DBS systems within four years of  grant of the authorization. All satellite stations in such a DBS system  shall be in operation within six years of the grant of the  authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DBS licensees shall be required to proceed consistent with all  applicable due diligence obligations, unless otherwise determined by the  Commission upon proper showing in any particular case. Transfer of  control of the authorization shall not be considered to justify  extension of these deadlines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Geographic service requirements. Those entities acquiring DBS  authorizations after January 19, 1996, or who after January 19, 1996  modify a previous DBS authorization to launch a replacement satellite,  must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii where such service is  technically feasible from the authorized orbital location. This  requirement does not apply to DBS satellites authorized to operate at  the 61.5[deg] W.L. orbital location. DBS applicants seeking to operate  from locations other than 61.5[deg] W.L. who do not provide service to  Alaska and Hawaii, must provide technical analyses to the Commission  demonstrating that such service is not feasible as a technical matter,  or that while technically feasible such services would require so many  compromises in satellite design and operation as to make it economically  unreasonable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> DBS subject to competitive bidding. Mutually exclusive initial  applications to provide DBS are subject to competitive bidding  procedures. The general competitive bidding procedures set forth in part  1, subpart Q of this chapter will apply unless otherwise provided in  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DBS long form application. Winning bidders are subject to the  provisions of Sec. 1.2107 of this chapter except that in lieu of a FCC  Form 601 each winning bidder shall submit the long-form satellite  service application (FCC Form 312) within thirty (30) days after being  notified by Public Notice that it is the winning bidder. Each winning  bidder   will also be required to submit by the same deadline the information  described in Sec. 25.215 (Technical) and Sec. 25.601 (EEO), and in  paragraph (f) of this section. Each winner also will be required to  file, by the same deadline, a signed statement describing its efforts to  date and future plans to come into compliance with any applicable  spectrum limitations, if it is not already in compliance. Such  information shall be submitted pursuant to the procedures set forth in  Sec. 25.114 and any associated Public Notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Technical qualifications. DBS operations must be in accordance  with the sharing criteria and technical characteristics contained in  Appendices 30 and 30A of the ITU's Radio Regulations. Operation of  systems using differing technical characteristics may be permitted, with  adequate technical showing, and if a request has been made to the ITU to  modify the appropriate Plans to include the system's technical  parameters.
