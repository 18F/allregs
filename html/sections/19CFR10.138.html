                            <p class="depth0">Within 3 years from the date of entry or withdrawal from warehouse  for consumption, the importer shall submit in duplicate in support of  his claim for free entry or for a reduced rate of duty a certificate  executed by (1) the superintendent or manager of the manufacturing  plant, or (2) the individual end-user or other person having knowledge  of the actual use of the imported article. The certificate shall include  a description of the processing in sufficient detail to show that the  use contemplated by the law has actually taken place. A blanket  certificate covering all purchases of a given type of merchandise from a  particular importer during a given period, or all such purchases with  specified exceptions, may be accepted for this purpose, provided the  importer shall furnish a statement showing in detail, in such manner as  to be readily identified with each entry, the merchandise which he sold  to such manufacturer or end-user during such period.
