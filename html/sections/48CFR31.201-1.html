In ascertaining  what constitutes a cost, any generally accepted method of determining or  estimating costs that is equitable and is consistently applied may be  used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While the total cost of a contract includes all costs properly  allocable to the contract, the allowable costs to the Government are  limited to those allocable costs which are allowable pursuant to Part 31  and applicable agency supplements.
