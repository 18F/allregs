                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of the preliminary inquiry is to determine whether, in the opinion of the officer appointed to conduct the preliminary inquiry (PIO), the questioned conduct occurred and, if so, whether it constitutes a violation of this part or the Code of Judicial Conduct. The PIO is to recommend appropriate action in cases of substantiated violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of the complaint and charges, the PIO shall promptly investigate the charges, generally following

the format and procedures set forth in the Manual of the Judge Advocate General for the conduct of command investigations. Reports of relevant investigations by other authorities including, but not limited to, State bar associations may be used. The PIO should also:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identify and obtain sworn affidavits or statements from all relevant and material witnesses to the extent practicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify, gather, and preserve all other relevant and material evidence; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide the covered attorney concerned an opportunity to review all evidence, affidavits, and statements collected and a reasonable period of time (normally not exceeding 7 days) to submit a written statement or any other written material that the covered attorney wishes considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The PIO may appoint and use such assistants as may be necessary to conduct the preliminary inquiry.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The PIO shall personally review the results of the preliminary inquiry to determine whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, a violation of this part or of the Judicial Code has occurred.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the PIO determines that no violation has occurred or that the violation is minor or technical in nature and warrants only corrective counseling, then he or she may recommend that the file be closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the PIO determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation did occur, and that corrective action greater than counseling may be warranted, he or she shall then recommend what further action is deemed appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The PIO shall forward (via the OEGCMJ in appropriate Marine cases) the results of the preliminary inquiry to the Rules Counsel, providing copies to the covered attorney concerned and all parties to whom the charges were previously sent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Rules Counsel shall review all preliminary inquiries. If the report is determined by the Rules Counsel to be incomplete, the Rules Counsel shall return it to the PIO, or to another inquiry officer, for further or supplemental inquiry. If the report is complete, then:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Rules Counsel determines, either consistent with the PIO recommendation or through the Rules Counsel's own review of the report, that a violation of this part or Code of Judicial Conduct has not occurred and that further action is not warranted, the Rules Counsel shall close the file and notify the complainant, the covered attorney concerned, and all officials previously provided copies of the complaint. JAG(13) and/or JAR, as appropriate, will maintain copies of all correspondence related to the closing of the file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Rules Counsel determines, either consistent with a PIO recommendation or through the Rules Counsel's own review of the report, that a violation of this part has occurred but that the violation is of a minor or technical nature, then the Rules Counsel may determine that corrective counseling is appropriate and close the file. The Rules Counsel shall report any such decision to the JAG. The Rules Counsel shall ensure that the covered attorney concerned receives appropriate counseling and shall notify the complainant, the covered attorney concerned, and all officials previously provided copies of the complaint that the file has been closed. JAG(13) and/or JAR, as appropriate, will maintain copies of all correspondence related to the closing of the file. The covered attorney concerned is responsible, under these circumstances, to determine if his or her Federal, state, or local licensing authority requires reporting such action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Rules Counsel determines, either consistent with a PIO recommendation or through the Rules Counsel's own review of the report, that further professional discipline or corrective action may be warranted, the Rules Counsel shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In cases involving Marine Corps attorneys not serving as defense counsel or attached to Navy units, request, on behalf of JAG, that the subject attorney's OEGCMJ appoint a disinterested covered attorney (normally senior to the covered attorney complained of and not previously involved

in the case) to conduct an ethics investigation into the matter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases, appoint, on behalf of JAG, a disinterested covered attorney (normally senior to the covered attorney complained of and not previously involved in the case) to conduct an ethics investigation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Notify those supervisory attorneys listed in Sec. 776.81(c) and Sec. 776.81(d) of this part.</p>
