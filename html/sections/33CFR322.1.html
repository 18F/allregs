See 33 CFR 320.2(b). Certain structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States are also regulated under other authorities of the DA. These include discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of

the United States, including the territorial seas, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344; see 33 CFR part 323) and the transportation of dredged material by vessel for purposes of dumping in ocean waters, including the territorial seas, pursuant to section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1413; see 33 CFR part 324). A DA permit will also be required under these additional authorities if they are applicable to structures or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States. Applicants for DA permits under this part should refer to the other cited authorities and implementing regulations for these additional permit requirements to determine whether they also are applicable to their proposed activities.</p>
