                            <p class="depth0">Under amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act employees not covered by reason of their personal engagement in interstate commerce activities, as

explained in Sec. 784.18, are nevertheless brought within the coverage of the Act if they are employed in an enterprise which is defined in section 3(s) of the Act as an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. Such employees, if not exempt from minimum wages and overtime pay under section 13(a)(5) or exempt from overtime pay under section 13(b)(4), will have to be paid in accordance with the monetary standards of the Act unless expressly exempt under some other provision. This would generally be true of employees employed in enterprises and by establishments engaged in the procurement, processing, marketing, or distribution of seafood and other aquatic products, where the enterprise has an annual gross sales volume of not less than $250,000. Enterprise coverage is more fully discussed in part 776 of this chapter, dealing with general coverage.</p>
