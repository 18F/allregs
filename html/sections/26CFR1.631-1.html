                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effect of election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 631 (a) provides an election to  certain taxpayers to treat the difference between the actual cost or  other basis of certain timber cut during the taxable year and its fair  market value as standing timber on the first day of such year as gain or  loss from a sale or exchange under section 1231. Thereafter, any  subsequent gain or loss shall be determined in accordance with paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purposes of section 631(a) and this section, timber  shall be considered cut at the time when in the ordinary course of  business the quantity of timber felled is first definitely determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The election may be made with respect to any taxable year even  though such election was not made with respect to a previous taxable  year. If an election has been made under the provisions of section  631(a), or corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, such  election shall be binding upon the taxpayer not only for the taxable  year for which the election is made but also for all subsequent taxable  years, unless the Commissioner on showing by the taxpayer of undue  hardship permits the taxpayer to revoke his election for such subsequent  taxable years. If the taxpayer has revoked a previous election, such  revocation shall preclude any further elections unless the taxpayer  obtains the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such election shall apply with respect to all timber which the  taxpayer has owned, or has had a contract right to cut, for a period of  more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9  months for taxable years beginning in 1977) prior to when such timber is  cut for sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business,  irrespective of whether such timber or contract right was acquired  before or after the election. (For purposes of the preceding sentence,  the rules with respect to the holding period of property contained in  section 1223 shall be applicable.) However, timber which is not cut for  sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business (for example,  firewood cut for the taxpayer's own household consumption) shall not be  considered to have been sold or exchanged upon the cutting thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Who may make election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer who has owned, or has held  a contract right to cut, timber for a period of more than 1 year (6  months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable  years beginning in 1977) prior to when the timber is cut may elect under  section 631(a) to consider the cutting of such timber during such year  for sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business as a sale or  exchange of the timber so cut. In order to have a contract right to cut  timber within the meaning of section 631(a) and this section, a taxpayer  must have a right to sell the timber cut under the contract on his own  account or to use such cut timber in his trade or business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of section 631(a) and this section, the term timber  includes evergreen trees which are more than six years old at the time  severed from their roots and are sold for ornamental purposes, such as  Christmas decorations. Section 631(a) is not applicable to evergreen  trees which are sold in a live state, whether or not for ornamental  purposes. Tops and other parts of standing timber are not considered as  evergreen trees within the meaning of section 631(a). The term evergreen  trees is used in its commonly accepted sense and includes pine, spruce,  fir, hemlock, cedar, and other coniferous trees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Manner of making election. The election under section 631(a)  must be made by the taxpayer in his income tax return for the taxable  year for which the election is applicable, and such election cannot be  made in an amended return for such year. The election in the return  shall take the form of a computation under the provisions of section  631(a) and section 1231.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Computation of gain or loss under the election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  cutting of timber is considered as a sale or exchange pursuant to an  election made under section 631(a), gain or loss shall be recognized to  the taxpayer in an amount equal to the difference between the adjusted  basis for depletion in the hands   of the taxpayer of the timber which has been cut during the taxable year  and the fair market value of such timber as of the first day of the  taxable year in which such timber is cut. The adjusted basis for  depletion of the cut timber shall be based upon the number of units of  timber cut during the taxable year which are considered to be sold or  exchanged and upon the depletion unit of the timber in the timber  account or accounts pertaining to the timber cut, and shall be computed  in the same manner as is provided in section 611 and the regulations  thereunder with respect to the computation of the allowance for  depletion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The fair market value of the timber as of the first day of the  taxable year in which such timber is cut shall be determined, subject to  approval or revision by the district director upon examination of the  taxpayer's return, by the taxpayer in the light of the most reliable and  accurate information available with reference to the condition of the  property as it existed at that date, regardless of all subsequent  changes, such as changes in surrounding circumstances, methods of  exploitation, degree of utilization, etc. The value sought will be the  selling price, assuming a transfer between a willing seller and a  willing buyer as of that particular day. Due consideration will be given  to the factors and the principles involved in the determination of the  fair market value of timber as described in the regulations under  section 611.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fair market value as of the beginning of the taxable year of  the standing timber cut during the year shall be considered to be the  cost of such timber, in lieu of the actual cost or other basis of such  timber, for all purposes for which such cost is a necessary factor. See  paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For any taxable year for which the cutting of timber is  considered to be a sale or exchange of such timber under section 631(a),  the timber so cut shall be considered as property used in the trade or  business for the purposes of section 1231, along with other property of  the taxpayer used in the trade or business as defined in section  1231(b), regardless of whether such timber is property of a kind which  would properly be includible in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand  at the close of the taxable year or property held by the taxpayer  primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or  business. Whether the gain or loss considered to have resulted from the  cutting of the timber will be considered to be gain or loss resulting  from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than 1 year (6  months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable  years beginning in 1977) depends upon the application of section 1231 to  the taxpayer for the taxable year. See section 1231 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Computation of subsequent gain or loss. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In case the products  of the timber are sold after cutting, either in the form of logs or  lumber or in the form of manufactured products, the income from such  actual sales shall be considered ordinary income. When the election  under section 631(a) is in effect, the cost of standing timber cut  during the taxable year is determined as if the taxpayer had purchased  such timber on the first day of the taxable year. Thus, in determining  the cost of the products so sold, the cost of the timber shall be the  fair market value on the first day of the taxable year in which the  standing timber was cut, in lieu of the actual cost or other basis of  such timber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This is also the rule in case the products of the timber cut  during one taxable year, with respect to which an election has been made  under section 631(a), are sold during a subsequent taxable year, whether  or not the election provided in section 631(a) is applicable with  respect to such subsequent year. If the products of the timber cut  during a taxable year with respect to which an election under section  631(a) was made were not sold during such year and are included in  inventory at the close of such year, the fair market value as of the  beginning of the year of the timber cut during the year shall be used in  lieu of the actual cost of such timber in computing the closing  inventory for such year and the opening inventory for the succeeding  year. With respect to the costs applicable in the determination of the  amount of such inventories, there shall be included the   fair market value of the timber cut, the costs of cutting, logging, and  all other expenses incident to the cost of converting the standing  timber into the products in inventory. See section 471 and the  regulations thereunder. The fact that the fair market value as of the  first day of the taxable year in which the timber is cut is deemed to be  the cost of such timber shall not preclude the taxpayer from computing  its inventories upon the basis of cost or market, whichever is lower, if  such is the method used by the taxpayer. Nor shall it preclude the  taxpayer from computing its inventories under the last-in, first-out  inventory method provided by section 472 if such section is applicable  to, and has been elected by, the taxpayer.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 7730, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]</p>
