                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy. It is the policy of the Corporation to provide the  widest possible access to releasable Corporation records at the least  possible cost. The purpose of the request is relevant to the fees  charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of request. Fees will be determined by category of  requests as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use requests. When a request for records is made for  commercial use, charges will be assessed to cover the costs of searching  for, reviewing for release, and reproducing the records sought.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests for educational and non-commercial scientific  institutions. When a request for records is made by an educational or  non-commercial scientific institution in furtherance of scholarly or  scientific research, respectively, charges may be assessed to cover the  cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for reproduction of the  first 100 pages. Whenever the total fee calculated is $18.00 or less, no  fee shall be charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests from representatives of the news media. When a request  for records is made by a representative of the news media for the  purpose of news dissemination, charges may be assessed to cover the cost  of reproduction alone, excluding the charges for reproduction of the  first 100 pages. Whenever the total fee calculated is $18.00 or less, no  fee shall be charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other requests. When other requests for records are made which  do not fit the three preceding categories, charges will be assessed to  cover the costs of searching for and reproducing the records sought,  excluding charges for the first two hours of search time and for  reproduction of the first 100 pages. (However, requests from individuals  for records about themselves contained in the Agency's systems of  records will be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of  1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) which permit the assessment of fees for  reproduction costs only, regardless of the requester's characterization  of the request.) Whenever the total fee calculated is $18.00 or less, no  fee shall be charged to the requester.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Direct costs. Fees assessed shall provide only for recovery of  the Corporation's direct costs of search, review, and reproduction.  Review costs shall include only the direct costs incurred during the  initial examination of a record for the purposes of determining whether  a record must be disclosed under this part and whether any portion of a  record is exempt from disclosure under this part. Review costs shall not  include any costs incurred in resolving legal or policy issues raised in  the course of processing a request or an appeal under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Charging of fees. The following charges may be assessed for  copies of records provided to a requester:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Copies made by photostat shall be charged at the rate of $0.10  per page.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Searches for requested records performed by clerical/ administrative personnel shall be charged at the rate of $4.00 per  quarter hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a search for requested records cannot be performed by  clerical administrative personnel (for example, where the tasks of  identifying and compiling records responsive to a request must be  performed by a skilled technician or professional), such search shall be  charged at the rate of $7.00 per quarter hour.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the time of managerial personnel is required, the fee  shall be $10.25 for each quarter hour of time spent by such managerial  personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Computer searches for requested records shall be charged at a  rate commensurate with the combined cost of computer operation and  operator's salary attributable to the search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Charges for non-release. Charges may be assessed for search and  review time, even if the Corporation fails to locate records responsive  to a request or if records located are determined to be exempt from  disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consent to pay fees. In the event that a request for records  does not state that the requester will pay all reasonable costs, or  costs up to a specified dollar amount, and the FOIA Officer determines  that the anticipated assessable costs for search, review and  reproduction of requested records will exceed $25.00, or will exceed the  limit specified in the request, the requester shall be promptly notified  in writing. Such notification shall state the anticipated assessable  costs of search, review and reproduction of records requested. The  requester shall be afforded an opportunity to amend the request to  narrow the scope of the request, or, alternatively, may agree to   be responsible for paying the anticipated costs. Such a request shall be  deemed to have been received by the Corporation upon the date of receipt  of the amended request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advance payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advance payment of assessable fees are not  required from a requester unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Corporation estimates or determines that assessable charges  are likely to exceed $250.00, and the requester has no history of  payment of FOIA fees. (Where the requester has a history of prompt  payment of fees, the Corporation shall notify the requester of the  likely cost and obtain written assurance of full payment.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A requester has previously failed to pay a FOIA fee charged in  a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the Corporation acts under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of  this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in Sec.  2507.5(a) and (b) will begin to run only after the Corporation has  received fee payments or assurances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interest on non-payment. Interest charges on an unpaid bill may  be assessed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the  billing was sent. Interest will be assessed at the rate prescribed in 31  U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing. The  Corporation may use the authorization of the Debt Collection Act of 1982  (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative  procedures, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and the  use of collection agencies, to encourage payment of delinquent fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Aggregating requests. Where the Corporation reasonably believes  that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting  to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of  avoiding fees, the Corporation may aggregate those requests and charge  accordingly. The Corporation may presume that multiple requests of this  type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees.  Where requests are separated by a longer period, the Corporation will  aggregate them only where there exists a solid basis for determining  that aggregation is warranted under the circumstances involved. Multiple  requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Making payment. Payment of fees shall be forwarded to the FOIA  Officer by check or money order payable to ``Corporation for National  and Community Service''. A receipt for any fees paid will be provided  upon written request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Fee processing. No fee shall be charged if the administrative  costs of collection and processing of such fees are equal to or do not  exceed the amount of the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. A requester may, in the original  request, or subsequently, apply for a waiver or reduction of document  search, review and reproduction fees. Such application shall be in  writing, and shall set forth in detail the reason(s) a fee waiver or  reduction should be granted. The amount of any reduction requested shall  be specified in the request. Upon receipt of such a request, the FOIA  Officer will determine whether a fee waiver or reduction should be  granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A waiver or reduction of fees shall be granted only if release  of the requested information to the requester is in the public interest  because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding  of the operations or activities of the Corporation, and it is not  primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The Corporation  shall consider the following factors in determining whether a waiver or  reduction of fees will be granted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Does the requested information concern the operations or  activities of the Corporation?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If so, will disclosure of the information be likely to  contribute to public understanding of the Corporation's operations and  activities?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If so, would such a contribution be significant?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Does the requester have a commercial interest that would be  furthered by disclosure of the information?</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If so, is the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of  the requester sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest  in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest  of the requester?</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In applying the criteria in paragraph (k)(1) of this section,  the Corporation will weigh the requester's commercial interest against  any public interest in disclosure. Where there is a public interest in  disclosure, and that interest can fairly be regarded as being of greater  magnitude than the requester's commercial interest, a fee waiver or  reduction may be granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a fee waiver application has been included in a request for  records, the request shall not be considered officially received until a  determination is made regarding the fee waiver application. Such  determination shall be made within five working days from the date any  such request is received in writing by the Corporation.</p>
